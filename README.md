# Trends in Ecology and Evolution

This repository contains data and analyses associated with temporal linguistic changes in how we talk about ecological and evolutionary processes.  The data are extracted directly from journals such as *Ecology*, *Evolution*, and *Molecular Ecology* by converting all articles from PDF to text and then using the latest natural languages processing techniques to:

1. Describe the temporal trajectory of the intellectual content.
2. Determine relationships between linguistic trajectory and novel research trends.
3. Circumscribe what makes a 'good' or 'well cited' manuscript.

All of this work is provided under an open source licence.  If you have any questions about this project, feel free to contact [Rodney Dyer](mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu).
