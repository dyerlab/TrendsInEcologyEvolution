Title = {{Comparative phylogeography of unglaciated eastern North America}},

Abstract = {{Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and
   plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for
   Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently,
   phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have been
   largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse lineages
   (including plants), it seems timely to assess the phylogeography across
   this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants
   and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii)
   discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography to
   issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change. Unglaciated
   eastern North America is a large, geologically and topographically
   complex area with the species examined having diverse distributions.
   Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns emerge: (i) maritime - Atlantic vs.
   Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River
   discontinuity; (iv) the Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the
   Mississippi River discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and
   Mississippi River discontinuities. Although initially documented in
   animals, most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing
   support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may
   generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during
   Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene).
   Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of
   glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as
   the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice
   Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique,
   rather than the shared, aspects of species' phylogeographical histories.
   Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can result from
   different underlying causal factors operating at different times (i.e.
   pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of pseudocongruence may
   result from the efforts of researchers to categorize patterns visually -
   similar patterns may, in fact, not fully coincide, and inferring
   agreement may obscure the actual patterns and lead to erroneous
   conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear spatial patterning
   and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical structure in diverse
   temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.}},

Title = {{When supercolonies collide: territorial aggression in an invasive and

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{4303-4315}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Some species of ants possess an unusual form of social organization in
   which aggression among nests is absent. This type of social
   organization, called unicoloniality, has been studied in only a handful
   of species and its evolutionary origins remain unclear. To date, no
   study has examined behavioural and genetic patterns at points of contact
   between the massive supercolonies that characterize unicoloniality.
   Since interactions at territory boundaries influence the costs of
   aggression and the likelihood of gene flow, such data may illuminate how
   supercolonies are formed and maintained. Here we provide field data on
   intraspecific territoriality for a widespread and invasive unicolonial
   social insect, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We observed
   abrupt and well-defined behavioural boundaries at 16 contact zones
   between three different pairs of supercolonies. We visited nine of these
   zones weekly during a six-month period and observed consistent and
   intense intercolony aggression that resulted in variable, but often
   large, levels of worker mortality. Microsatellite variation along six
   transects across territory borders showed that F(ST) values were lower
   within supercolonies (0.08 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- SE)) than between
   supercolonies (0.29 +/- 0.01) and that this disparity was especially
   strong right at territory borders, despite direct and prolonged contact
   between the supercolonies. Matrix correspondence tests confirmed that
   levels of aggression and genetic differentiation were significantly
   correlated, but no relationship existed between geographic distance and
   either intraspecific aggression or genetic differentiation. Patterns of
   F(ST) variation indicated high levels of gene flow within supercolonies,
   but little to no gene flow between them. Overall, these findings are
   inconsistent with a model of relaxed ecological constraints leading to
   colony fusion and suggest that environmentally derived cues are not the
   prime determined of nestmate recognition in field populations of
   Argentine ants.}},

Abstract = {{Squids from the genus Euprymna (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) and their
   symbiotic bacteria Vibrio fischeri form a mutualism in which vibrios
   inhabit a complex light organ within the squid host. A host-mediated
   daily expulsion event seeds surrounding seawater with symbiotically
   capable V. fischeri that environmentally colonize newly hatched axenic
   Euprymna juveniles. Competition experiments using native and non-native
   Vibrio have shown that this expulsion/re-colonization phenomenon has led
   to cospeciation in this system in the Pacific Ocean; however, the
   genetic architecture of these symbiotic populations has not been
   determined. Using genetic diversity and nested clade analyses we have
   examined the variation and history of three allopatric Euprymna squid
   species (E. scolopes of Hawaii, E. hyllebergi of Thailand, and E.
   tasmanica from Australia) and their respective Vibrio symbionts.
   Euprymna populations appear to be very genetically distinct from each
   other, exhibiting little or no migration over large geographical
   distances. In contrast, Vibrio symbiont populations contain more diverse
   haplotypes, suggesting both host presence and unidentified factors
   facilitating long-distance migration structure in Pacific Vibrio
   populations. Findings from this study highlight the importance of how
   interactions between symbiotic organisms can unexpectedly shape
   population structure in phylogeographical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Zapus hudsonius preblei, listed as threatened under the US Endangered
   Species Act (ESA), is one of 12 recognized subspecies of meadow jumping
   mice found in North America. Recent morphometric and phylogenetic
   comparisons among Z. h. preblei and neighbouring conspecifics questioned
   the taxonomic status of selected subspecies, resulting in a proposal to
   delist the Z. h. preblei from the ESA. We present additional analyses of
   the phylogeographic structure within Z. hudsonius that calls into
   question previously published data (and conclusions) and confirms the
   original taxonomic designations. A survey of 21 microsatellite DNA loci
   and 1380 base pairs from two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions (control
   region and cytochrome b) revealed that each Z. hudsonius subspecies is
   genetically distinct. These data do not support the null hypothesis of a
   homogeneous gene pool among the five subspecies found within the
   southwestern portion of the species' range. The magnitude of the
   observed differentiation was considerable and supported by significant
   findings for nearly every statistical comparison made, regardless of the
   genome or the taxa under consideration. Structuring of nuclear
   multilocus genotypes and subspecies-specific mtDNA haplotypes
   corresponded directly with the disjunct distributions of the subspecies
   investigated. Given the level of correspondence between the observed
   genetic population structure and previously proposed taxonomic
   classification of subspecies (based on the geographic separation and
   surveys of morphological variation), we conclude that the nominal
   subspecies surveyed in this study do not warrant synonymy, as has been
   proposed for Z. h. preblei, Z. h. campestris, and Z. h. intermedius.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may severely affect survival of social insect
   populations as the number of nests per population, not the number of
   individuals, represents population size, hence they may be particularly
   prone to loss of genetic diversity. Erosion of genetic diversity may be
   particularly significant among social Hymenoptera such as bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.), as this group may be susceptible to diploid male
   production, a suggested direct cost of inbreeding. Here, for the first
   time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a
   threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly
   fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population
   sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range
   21-72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss
   of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic
   structuring between populations (theta = 0.084) was found, but evidence
   of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across
   highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where
   this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in
   allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in
   the continental population. While not directly related to population
   size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between
   UK populations relative to continental populations. We suggest that
   populations now existing on isolated habitat islands were probably
   linked by stepping-stone populations prior to recent habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Lyresnake (Trimorphodon biscutatus) is a widespread,
   polytypic taxon inhabiting arid regions from the warm deserts of the
   southwestern United States southward along the Pacific versant of Mexico
   to the tropical deciduous forests of Mesoamerica. This broadly
   distributed species provides a unique opportunity to evaluate a priori
   biogeographical hypotheses spanning two major distinct biogeographical
   realms (the Nearctic and Neotropical) that are usually treated
   separately in phylogeographical analyses. I investigated the
   phylogeography of T. biscutatus using maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from across this
   species' range. Phylogenetic analyses recovered five well-supported
   clades whose boundaries are concordant with existing geographical
   barriers, a pattern consistent with a model of vicariant allopatric
   divergence. Assuming a vicariance model, divergence times between
   mitochondrial lineages were estimated using Bayesian relaxed molecular
   clock methods calibrated using geological information from putative
   vicariant events. Divergence time point estimates were bounded by broad
   confidence intervals, and thus these highly conservative estimates
   should be considered tentative hypotheses at best. Comparison of mtDNA
   lineages and taxa traditionally recognized as subspecies based on
   morphology suggest this taxon is comprised of multiple independent
   lineages at various stages of divergence, ranging from putative
   secondary contact and hybridization to sympatry of `subspecies'.}},

Title = {{A chloroplast genealogy of myrmecophytic Macaranga species

Abstract = {{Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) includes about 280 species with a palaeotropic
   distribution. The genus not only comprises some of the most prominent
   pioneer tree species in Southeast Asian lowland dipterocarp forests, it
   also exhibits a substantial radiation of ant-plants (myrmecophytes).
   Obligate ant-plant mutualisms are formed by about 30 Macaranga species
   and 13 ant species of the genera Crematogaster or Camponotus. To improve
   our understanding of the co-evolution of the ants and their host plants,
   we aim at reconstructing comparative organellar phylogeographies of both
   partners across their distributional range. Preliminary evidence
   indicated that chloroplast DNA introgression among closely related
   Macaranga species might occur. We therefore constructed a comprehensive
   chloroplast genealogy based on DNA sequence data from the noncoding
   ccmp2, ccmp6, and atpB-rbcL regions for 144 individuals from 41
   Macaranga species, covering all major evolutionary lineages within the
   three sections that contain myrmecophytes. A total of 88 chloroplast
   haplotypes were identified, and grouped into a statistical parsimony
   network that clearly distinguished sections and well-defined
   subsectional groups. Within these groups, the arrangement of haplotypes
   followed geographical rather than taxonomical criteria. Thus, up to six
   chloroplast haplotypes were found within single species, and up to seven
   species shared a single haplotype. The spatial distribution of the
   chloroplast types revealed several dispersals between the Malay
   Peninsula and Borneo, and a deep split between Sabah and the remainder
   of Borneo. Our large-scale chloroplast genealogy highlights the complex
   history of migration, hybridization, and speciation in the myrmecophytes
   of the genus Macaranga. It will serve as a guideline for adequate
   sampling and data interpretation in phylogeographic studies of
   individual Macaranga species and species groups.}},

Abstract = {{Recent palaeoclimactic research suggests that fluctuating environmental
   conditions throughout the Pleistocene of Amazonia occurred with
   previously unrecognized frequency. This has resulted in a theoretical
   shift from glacially influenced fluctuations to those driven by
   precessional rhythms. This theoretical revolution has a profound impact
   on expectations of biotic diversity within biogeographical regions that
   have long been based on the idea of large-scale landscape fragmentation
   associated with increased aridity and glacial cycles. Generally
   speaking, this shifts phylogeographical expectations from that of (i)
   large areas of sympatry of closely related (but not sister) species
   whose origins lie in separate refugia, and current distributions are the
   results of cyclic connectivity of those two refugia (refuge hypothesis),
   to that of (ii) fine scale genetic structure, often associated with
   elevation, and divergence well below expected speciation levels
   {[}disturbance-vicariance (DV) hypothesis]. To date there have been few
   tests of the expectations of the DV hypothesis based on empirical
   studies of Neotropical floral and faunal communities. Herein we examine
   phylogeographical structure of Dendrobates tinctorius, an amphibian
   species endemic to the uplands of the eastern Guiana Shield, based on
   sampling of 114 individuals from 24 localities. Phylogenetic, nested
   clade, and dispersal-vicariance (DIVA) analyses of cytochrome b sequence
   data reveal the presence of two mitochondrial lineages that are
   associated with previously identified western and eastern uplands of
   this area. The geographical distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes and
   the results of DIVA and coalescent analyses suggest that there has been
   extensive secondary contact between these lineages indicating a complex
   history of connectivity between these western and eastern highlands,
   supporting the predictions of the DV hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of populations of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in
   East Asia was assessed by making host range and gene sequence
   comparisons of 118 isolates utilizing a population genetic approach.
   Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China
   infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both
   Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of
   recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the
   full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent
   with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one
   recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese
   populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal-BR
   lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have
   since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this
   basal-BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the
   deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual
   geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by
   analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent
   Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but
   are discrete lineages.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Pleistocene glaciations represent the most recent and dramatic
   series of habitat changes since the Cretaceous. The impact of these
   events was particularly acute for aquatic taxa with poor powers of
   dispersal, but few organisms have evolutionary histories more intimately
   entwined with the advance and retreat of ice than the `glacial relicts'.
   In this study, we used a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI), to examine and compare the phylogeographical structure
   of two glacial relict crustaceans (Limnocalanus macrurus and members of
   the Mysis relicta species group) across North America. In both cases, we
   found a sharp phylogenetic division between populations from inland
   lakes formed during glacial retreat, and arctic lakes isolated from
   polar seas via isostatic rebound. However, the depth of this
   phylogenetic partition varied between taxa. In L. macrurus, nucleotide
   sequence divergence of 2.2\% between these zones is consistent with its
   current status as a single morphologically variable species, but in
   Mysis the split occurred among recently described, morphologically
   conserved species, at a divergence of 8.2\%. The disparity in the depth
   of divergence indicates a history of recurrent freshwater invasions from
   the arctic seas, in concordance with previous studies of Eurasian
   glacial relicts. However, we suggest further consideration of a largely
   overlooked explanation that could account for some of the discrepancies
   between molecular divergences and glaciation events. Many cladogenetic
   events could have occurred in arctic seas prior to the transition to
   inland waters, a possibility supported both by the complex physical and
   ionic history of arctic seas and by high marine and estuarine lineage
   diversity in the north.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The fossil record indicates that the brown bear (Ursus arctos) colonized
   North America from Asia over 50 000 years ago. The species historically
   occupied the western United States and northern Mexico but has been
   extirpated from over 99\% of this range in the last two centuries. To
   evaluate colonization hypotheses, subspecific classifications, and
   historical patterns and levels of genetic diversity in this region, we
   sequenced 229 nucleotides of the mitochondrial DNA control region in 108
   museum specimens. The work was set in a global context by synthesizing
   all previous brown bear control region sequences from around the world.
   In mid-latitude North America a single moderately diverse clade is
   observed, represented by 23 haplotypes with up to 3.5\% divergence. Only
   eight of 23 haplotypes (35\%) are observed in the extensively sampled
   extant populations suggesting a substantial loss of genetic variability.
   The restriction of all haplotypes from mid-latitude North America to a
   single clade suggests that this region was founded by bears with a
   similar maternal ancestry. However, the levels and distributions of
   diversity also suggest that the colonizing population was not a small
   founder event, and that expansion occurred long enough ago for local
   mutations to accrue. Our data are consistent with recent genetic
   evidence that brown bears were south of the ice prior to the last
   glacial maximum. There is no support for previous subspecies
   designations, although bears of the southwestern United States may have
   had a distinctive, but recent, pattern of ancestry.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic reproductive barriers among the species of Petunia are weak
   and genetic isolation is obtained mainly by geographical separation and
   ecological diversification. The Serra do Sudeste region in the extreme
   south of Brazil is one of the centres of diversity of this genus and is
   characterized by the presence of species with different pollination
   syndromes. Petunia exserta is known only from four sandstone towers in a
   restricted area of this region (about 500 km(2)) and is characterized by
   its differentiated habitat (shelters in the sandstone towers) and by its
   floral characteristics adapted to ornithophily. In towers where this
   species is sympatric with the sphingophilous Petunia axillaris,
   phylogenetically close to P. exserta, we found plants with intermediate
   floral morphology, suggesting hybridization between them. To test this
   hypothesis and to better understand its consequences we analysed the
   sequences of the plastid trnH-psbA, trnS-trnG and psbB-psbH intergenic
   spacers in 121 individuals sampled all over the P. exserta distribution.
   The joint analysis of the three markers revealed 13 haplotypes and the
   network showed two main genetic clades, which probably represent the
   original gene pool of the two species in the region. In general,
   individuals of a given population presented the same haplotype,
   independently of phenotype, corroborating the hybridization hypothesis.
   Field observations suggest that hummingbirds are responsible for the
   interspecific gene flow. Analysis of molecular variance revealed high
   interpopulational diversity among the towers. The low gene flow between
   populations is possibly related to the autochoric seed dispersion
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum (Nototheniidae) is the
   most abundant pelagic fish inhabiting Antarctic waters. In this study we
   investigated, through partial sequencing of the D-loop mitochondrial
   region, samples collected at four different locations in the Southern
   Ocean, three in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific sector. Sampling was
   replicated in two different years at two locations. Sequence analysis
   showed a remarkably high polymorphism, with 110 haplotypes over the 256
   investigated specimens, and about 80\% of haplotypes occurring only
   once. Neutrality tests indicated that all samples were not at
   mutation-drift equilibrium, and suggested a past population expansion.
   This result was supported by the presence of a star-like topology in the
   D-loop gene tree, and by results of mismatch distribution. The start of
   the expansion was dated, using a specifically calibrated clock, between
   111 and 126 thousand years ago. This value corresponds to the start of
   the cooling period that led to the last glaciation peak, and is in close
   agreement with a recently suggested range expansion for pelagic
   Antarctic ecosystems. Analysis of molecular variation indicated a small,
   though highly significant, value of differentiation between samples.
   This result, together with the lack of association between clades and
   geographical locations, indicates a weak population structure for the
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative phylogeographic studies of animals with low mobility and/or
   high habitat specificity remain rare, yet such organisms may hold
   fine-grained palaeoecological signal. Comparisons of multiple,
   codistributed species can elucidate major historical events. As part of
   a multitaxon programme, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI)
   variation was analysed in two species of terrestrial flatworm,
   Artioposthia lucasi and Caenoplana coerulea. We applied coalescent
   demographic estimators and nested clade analysis to examine responses to
   past, landscape-scale, cooling-drying events in a model system of
   montane forest (Tallaganda). Correspondence of haplotype groups in both
   species to previously proposed microbiogeographic regions indicates at
   least four refuges from cool, dry conditions. The region predicted to
   hold the highest quality refuges (the Eastern Slopes Region), is
   indicated to have been a long-term refuge in both species, but so are
   several other regions. Coalescent analyses suggest that populations of
   A. lucasi are declining, while C. coerulea is expanding, although
   stronger population substructure in the former could yield similar
   patterns in the data. The differences in spatial and temporal genetic
   variation in the two species could be explained by differences in
   ecological attributes: A. lucasi is predicted to have lower dispersal
   ability but may be better able to withstand cold conditions. Thus,
   different contemporary population dynamics may reflect different
   responses to recent (Holocene) climate warming. The two species show
   highly congruent patterns of catchment-based local genetic endemism with
   one another and with previously studied slime-mould grazing Collembola.}},

Abstract = {{Although the mechanisms controlling gene flow among populations are
   particularly important for evolutionary processes, they are still poorly
   understood, especially in the case of large carnivoran mammals with
   extensive continuous distributions. We studied the question of factors
   affecting population genetic structure in the grey wolf, Canis lupus,
   one of the most mobile terrestrial carnivores. We analysed variability
   in mitochondrial DNA and 14 microsatellite loci for a sample of 643
   individuals from 59 localities representing most of the continuous wolf
   range in Eastern Europe. We tested an array of geographical, historical
   and ecological factors to check whether they may explain genetic
   differentiation among local wolf populations. We showed that wolf
   populations in Eastern Europe displayed nonrandom spatial genetic
   structure in the absence of obvious physical barriers to movement.
   Neither topographic barriers nor past fragmentation could explain
   spatial genetic structure. However, we found that the genetic
   differentiation among local populations was correlated with climate,
   habitat types, and wolf diet composition. This result shows that
   ecological processes may strongly influence the amount of gene flow
   among populations. We suggest natal-habitat-biased dispersal as an
   underlying mechanism linking population ecology with population genetic
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression, as commonly found in natural populations, should
   favour the evolution of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. If natal
   dispersal, the first and probably most effective mechanism, does not
   lead to a complete separation of males and females from a common origin,
   a small-scale genetic population structure may result and other
   mechanisms to avoid inbreeding may exist. We studied the genetic
   population structure and individual mating patterns in blue tits (Parus
   caeruleus). The population showed a local genetic structure in two out
   of four years: genetic relatedness between individuals (estimated from
   microsatellite markers) decreased with distance. This pattern was mainly
   caused by immigrants to the study area; these, if paired with fellow
   immigrants, were more related than expected by chance. Since blue tits
   did not avoid inbreeding with their social partner, we examined if
   individuals preferred less related partners at later stages of the mate
   choice process. We found no evidence that females or males avoided
   inbreeding through extra-pair copulations or through mate desertion and
   postbreeding dispersal. Although the small-scale genetic population
   structure suggests that blue tits could use a simple rule of thumb to
   select less related mates, females did not generally prefer more
   distantly breeding extra-pair partners. However, the proportion of young
   fathered by an extra-pair male in mixed paternity broods depended on the
   genetic relatedness with the female. This suggests that there is a
   fertilization bias towards less related copulation partners and that
   blue tits are able to reduce the costs of inbreeding through a
   postcopulatory process.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of salmonids can discriminate kin from unrelated
   conspecifics using olfactory cues. In this study, we determined the role
   of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in kin discrimination by
   juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brook trout (Salvelinus
   fontinalis). Genetic variation at the highly polymorphic exon coding for
   peptide-binding region of an MHC class II gene was studied using
   polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
   Experiments compared discrimination ability based on MHC haplotypes both
   within and among kin and non-kin groups. Juveniles chose kin sharing
   both alleles over kin sharing no alleles. Juveniles also preferred
   non-kin sharing both alleles to non-kin sharing no alleles. These data
   suggest that the MHC class II gene influence kin discrimination in
   juvenile Atlantic salmon and brook trout. The influence of additional
   genes was also apparent in trials where juveniles were able to recognize
   kin sharing no alleles over non-kin sharing no alleles. However, the
   inability of juveniles to discriminate between kin sharing no alleles
   and non-kin sharing either one or both alleles indicates that MHC is as
   potent as the rest of the genome in producing distinguishable odours.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding population-scale processes that affect allele frequency
   changes across generations is a long-standing interest in genetic,
   ecological and evolutionary research. In particular, individual
   differences in female reproductive success and the spatial scale of gene
   flow considerably affect evolutionary change and patterns of local
   selection. In this study, a recently developed maximum-likelihood (ML)
   method based on established offspring, the Seedling Neighbourhood Model,
   was applied and exponentially shaped dispersal kernels were fitted to
   both genetic and ecological data in a widespread Mediterranean pine,
   Pinus pinaster Aiton. The distribution of female reproductive success in
   P. pinaster was very skewed (about 10\% of trees mothered 50\% of
   offspring) and significant positive female selection gradients for
   diameter (gamma = 0.7293) and cone crop (gamma = 0.4524) were found. The
   selective advantage of offspring mothered by bigger trees could be due
   to better-quality seeds. These seeds may show more resilience to severe
   summer droughts and microsite variation related to water and nutrient
   availability. Both approaches, ecological and of parentage, consistently
   showed a long-distance dispersal component in saplings that was not
   found in dispersal kernels based on seed shadows, highlighting the
   importance of Janzen-Connell effects and microenvironmental variation

Abstract = {{Natal homing is a hallmark of the life history of salmonid fishes, but
   the spatial scale of homing within local, naturally reproducing salmon
   populations is still poorly understood. Accurate homing (paired with
   restricted movement) should lead to the existence of fine-scale genetic
   structuring due to the spatial clustering of related individuals on
   spawning grounds. Thus, we explored the spatial resolution of natal
   homing using genetic associations among individual Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an interconnected stream network. We also
   investigated the relationship between genetic patterns and two factors
   hypothesized to influence natal homing and localized movements at finer
   scales in this species, localized patterns in the distribution of
   spawning gravels and sex. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that
   spawning locations in both sub-basins of our study site were spatially
   clumped, but the upper sub-basin generally had a larger spatial extent
   and continuity of redd locations than the lower sub-basin, where the
   distribution of redds and associated habitat conditions were more
   patchy. Male genotypes were not autocorrelated at any spatial scale in
   either sub-basin. Female genotypes showed significant spatial
   autocorrelation and genetic patterns for females varied in the direction
   predicted between the two sub-basins, with much stronger autocorrelation
   in the sub-basin with less continuity in spawning gravels. The patterns
   observed here support predictions about differential constraints and
   breeding tactics between the two sexes and the potential for fine-scale
   habitat structure to influence the precision of natal homing and
   localized movements of individual Chinook salmon on their breeding
   grounds.}},

Abstract = {{Since its immigration in the Pacific island of New Caledonia in 1942
   (i.e. about 240 tick-generations ago), the cattle tick Boophilus
   microplus has experienced a remarkable adaptive diversification there.
   In order to better understand the population factors involved, we have
   investigated the B. microplus population structure on that main
   host-species, Bos taurus. This study was based microsatellite loci and
   confirmed that the island colonization came along with a significant
   bottleneck. Knowledge on B. microplus biology led us to expect B.
   microplus populations to be composed of highly inbred lineages
   irregularly dispatched among the individual hosts belonging to the same
   herds. Instead, this study evidenced a weak inbreeding level and an
   absence of genetic differentiation within herds. Complementarily, a
   significant signal of isolation by distance exhibited that human-traffic
   of cattle does not promote high tick dispersal within the island.
   Finally, the tick density was found to be about a few hundreds of
   reproducing adults per squared kilometre, for a gene dispersal range of
   about a few hundred metres per tick generation. Results are discussed
   with regard to the evolution of new adaptive changes.}},

   grouped populations into low and completely plated morphs, whereas
   microsatellites failed to do so. Furthermore, partially plated fish were
   heterozygous with respect to the distinctive EDA alleles for completely
   and low plated morphs, indicating that completely plated morph alleles
   are not entirely dominant in controlling the expression of lateral plate
   number. An examination of population differentiation in plate number
   with quantitative genetic methods revealed that the degree of
   differentiation exceeded that expected from genetic drift alone (Q(ST) >
   F-ST). Our results support the adaptive genetic differentiation of plate
   morphs and the view that distinctive EDA gene polymorphism occurs in
   similar sites across the distribution range of this species. Yet, allele
   frequency differentiation in the Gac4174 microsatellite locus,
   informative in experimental crosses for plate number variation, did not
   differ from that of neutral markers and, was therefore unable to detect
   the signature of natural selection responsible for population
   divergence.}},

Abstract = {{The hybrid sunflower species Helianthus paradoxus inhabits sporadic salt
   marshes in New Mexico and southwest Texas, USA, whereas its parental
   species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris, are salt
   sensitive. Previous studies identified three genomic regions -
   survivorship quantitative trait loci (QTLs) - that were under strong
   selection in experimental hybrids transplanted into the natural habitat
   of H. paradoxus. Here we ask whether these same genomic regions
   experienced significant selection during the origin and evolution of the
   natural hybrid, H. paradoxus. This was accomplished by comparing the
   variability of microsatellites linked to the three survivorship QTLs
   with those from genomic regions that were neutral in the experimental
   hybrids. As predicted if one or more selective sweeps had occurred in
   these regions, microsatellites linked to the survivorship QTLs exhibited
   a significant reduction in diversity in populations of the natural
   hybrid species. In contrast, no difference in diversity levels was
   observed between the two microsatellite classes in parental populations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to novel environments
   remains one of the major challenges confronting evolutionary biologists.
   While newly developed genomic approaches hold considerable promise for
   addressing this overall question, the relevant tools have not often been
   available in the most ecologically interesting organisms. Our study
   organism, Drosophila mojavensis, is a cactophilic Sonoran Desert endemic
   utilizing four different cactus hosts across its geographical range. Its
   well-known ecology makes it an attractive system in which to study the
   evolution of gene expression during adaptation. As a cactophile, D.
   mojavensis oviposits in the necrotic tissues of cacti, therefore
   exposing larvae and even adults to the varied and toxic compounds of
   rotting cacti. We have developed a cDNA microarray of D. mojavensis to
   examine gene expression associated with cactus host use. Using a
   population from the Baja California population we examined gene
   expression differences of third instar larvae when reared in two
   chemically distinct cactus hosts, agria (Stenocereus gummosus, native
   host) vs. organpipe (Stenocereus thurberi, alternative host). We have
   observed differential gene expression associated with cactus host use in
   genes involved in metabolism and detoxification.}},

Abstract = {{Convergent phenotypes are testament to the role of natural selection in
   evolution. However, little is known about whether convergence in
   phenotype extends to convergence at the molecular level. We use the
   independent losses of floral anthocyanins in columbines (Aquilegia) to
   determine the degree of molecular convergence in gene expression across
   the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP). Using a phylogeny of the
   North American Aquilegia clade, we inferred six independent losses of
   floral anthocyanins. Via semiquantitative reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we monitored
   developmental and tissue-specific variation in expression of the six
   major structural ABP loci in three Aquilegia species, two that produce
   anthocyanins (A+) and one that does not (A-). We then compared ABP
   expression in petals of old-bud and pre-anthesis flowers of 13 Aquilegia
   species, eight wild species and two horticultural lines representing
   seven independent A- lineages as well as three wild A+ species. We only
   found evidence of down-regulation of ABP loci in A- lineages and losses
   of expression were significantly more prevalent for genes late in the
   pathway. Independent contrast analysis indicates that changes in
   expression of dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase
   (ANS) are strongly phylogenetically correlated consistent with the
   multilocus targets of trans-regulatory elements in the ABP of other
   systems. Our findings strongly suggest that pleiotropy constrains the
   evolution of loss of floral anthocyanins to mutations affecting genes
   late in the ABP mostly through convergent changes in regulatory genes.
   These patterns support the hypothesis that rapid evolutionary change
   occurs largely through regulatory rather than structural mutations.}},

Abstract = {{The interest to study the effects of inbreeding in natural populations
   has increased in the last years. Several microsatellite-derived metrics
   have recently been developed to infer inbreeding from multilocus
   heterozygosity data without requiring detailed pedigrees that are
   difficult to obtain in open populations. Internal relatedness (IR) is
   currently the most widespread used index and its main attribute is that
   allele frequency is incorporated into the measure. However, IR
   underestimates heterozygosity of individuals carrying rare alleles. For
   example, descendants of immigrants paired with natives (normally more
   outbred) bearing novel or rare alleles would be considered more
   homozygous than descendants of native parents. Thus, the analogy between
   homozygosity and inbreeding that generally is carried out would have no
   logic in those cases. We propose an alternative index, homozygosity by
   loci (HL) that avoids such problems by weighing the contribution of each
   locus to the homozygosity index depending on their allelic variability.
   Under a wide range of simulated scenarios, we found that our index (HL)
   correlated better than both IR and uncorrected homozygosity (H-O),
   measured as proportion of homozygous loci) with genome-wide homozygosity
   and inbreeding coefficients in open populations. In these populations,
   which are likely to prevail in nature, the use of HL instead of IR
   reduced considerably the sample sizes required to achieve a given
   statistical power. This is likely to have important consequences on the
   ability to detect heterozygosity fitness correlations assuming the
   relationship between genome-wide heterozygosity and fitness traits.}},

Abstract = {{Coral reefs have suffered long-term decline due to a range of
   anthropogenic disturbances and are now also under threat from climate
   change. For appropriate management of these vulnerable and valuable
   ecosystems it is important to understand the factors and processes that
   determine their resilience and that of the organisms inhabiting them, as
   well as those that have led to existing patterns of coral reef
   biodiversity. The scleractinian (stony) corals deposit the structural
   framework that supports and promotes the maintenance of biological
   diversity and complexity of coral reefs, and as such, are major
   components of these ecosystems. The success of reef-building corals is
   related to their obligate symbiotic association with dinoflagellates of
   the genus Symbiodinium. These one-celled algal symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   live in the endodermal tissues of their coral host, provide most of the
   host's energy budget and promote rapid calcification. Furthermore,
   zooxanthellae are the main primary producers on coral reefs due to the
   oligotrophic nature of the surrounding waters. In this review paper, we
   summarize and critically evaluate studies that have employed genetics
   and/or molecular biology in examining questions relating to the
   evolution and ecology of reef-building corals and their algal
   endosymbionts, and that bear relevance to coral reef conservation. We
   discuss how these studies can focus future efforts, and examine how
   these approaches enhance our understanding of the resilience of
   reef-building corals.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies that reveal a correlation between heterozygosity and
   fitness in natural populations have rekindled interest in whether
   balancing selection is widespread or an evolutionary oddity. We
   therefore quantified heterozygote advantage at 12 microsatellite markers
   in both inbred and outbred crosses of Drosophila grown under different
   forms of environmental stress. As expected, inbreeding depression
   reduces fitness relative to the outbred controls. In addition, many loci
   exhibit heterozygote advantage over and above any effect due to
   inbreeding, with similar to 30\% of markers showing an effect in any
   given culture condition and similar to 75\% of markers showing an effect
   in at least one of the four culture conditions. To explore the extent of
   linkage disequilibrium surrounding these loci we further typed four new
   markers close to each of the three strongest hits. We find a pattern
   where the extent of heterozygote excess tends to decline to
   nonsignificance within around 1.5 megabases (Mb) either side of the
   original hit. Crude extrapolation suggests 12 genes or regions
   experience detectable levels of heterozygote advantage in any one
   condition and as many as 25 overall. Thus, balancing selection is
   widespread and is likely to play an important role in maintaining
   genetic variability.}},

   occidentalis Nutt.) represent two closely related species with
   contrasting abundance and distribution patterns in Western North
   America. Genetic diversity at seven informative microsatellite loci was
   determined for 19 populations of subalpine larch and nine populations of
   western larch. Contrasting genetic diversity and patterns of population
   differentiation were observed between the two species. The overall
   within-population genetic diversity parameters were lower in subalpine
   larch (A = 3.2; A(P) = 3.6; H(E) = 0.418) than in western larch (A(P) =
   5.51; H(E) = 0.580), a pattern that is likely related to historical or
   demographic factors. No evidence of interspecific hybridization was
   observed. Significantly more population differentiation (theta = 0.15;
   R(ST) = 0.07), consistent with more restricted gene flow, was observed
   for subalpine larch as compared to western larch (theta = 0.05; R(ST) =
   0.04). Under the assumption of an infinite allele mutation model, 12 of
   the 19 subalpine larch populations showed signs of deviation from the
   mutation-drift equilibrium, which suggests Holocene population
   bottlenecks and fluctuations in effective population size for this
   species. None of the western larch populations deviated significantly
   from the mutation-drift equilibrium. For both species, Mantel's test
   revealed a significant positive relationship between geographical and
   genetic distances indicative of isolation by distance. A similar
   geographical structure was detected in both species, suggesting at least
   two genetically distinct glacial populations in each species. The
   various implications for gene conservation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, is a widespread
   tropical and subtropical disease vector. In the Hawaiian Islands, where
   it was introduced accidentally almost two centuries ago, it is
   considered the primary vector of avian malaria and pox. Avian malaria in
   particular has contributed to the extinction and endangerment of
   Hawaii's native avifauna, and has altered the altitudinal distribution
   of native bird populations. We examined the population genetic structure
   of Cx. quinquefasciatus on the island of Hawaii at a smaller spatial
   scale than has previously been attempted, with particular emphasis on
   the effects of elevation on population genetic structure. We found
   significant genetic differentiation among populations and patterns of
   isolation by distance within the island. Elevation per se did not have a
   limiting effect on gene flow; however, there was significantly lower
   genetic diversity among populations at mid elevations compared to those
   at low elevations. A recent sample taken from just above the predicted
   upper altitudinal distribution of Cx. quinquefasciatus on the island of
   Hawaii was confirmed as being a temporary summer population and appeared
   to consist of individuals from more than one source population. Our
   results indicate effects of elevation gradients on genetic structure
   that are consistent with known effects of elevation on population
   dynamics of this disease vector.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and genetic studies of marine turtles generally support the
   hypothesis of natal homing, but leave open the question of the
   geographical scale of genetic exchange and the capacity of turtles to
   shift breeding sites. Here we combine analyses of mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) variation and recapture data to assess the geographical scale of
   individual breeding populations and the distribution of such populations
   through Australasia. We conducted multiscale assessments of mtDNA
   variation among 714 samples from 27 green turtle rookeries and of adult
   female dispersal among nesting sites in eastern Australia. Many of these
   rookeries are on shelves that were flooded by rising sea levels less
   than 10 000 years (c. 450 generations) ago. Analyses of sequence
   variation among the mtDNA control region revealed 25 haplotypes, and
   their frequency distributions indicated 17 genetically distinct breeding
   stocks (Management Units) consisting either of individual rookeries or
   groups of rookeries in general that are separated by more than 500 km.
   The population structure inferred from mtDNA was consistent with the
   scale of movements observed in long-term mark-recapture studies of east
   Australian rookeries. Phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes revealed
   five clades with significant partitioning of sequence diversity (Phi =
   68.4) between Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asian/Indian Ocean rookeries.
   Isolation by distance was indicated for rookeries separated by up to
   2000 km but explained only 12\% of the genetic structure. The emerging
   general picture is one of dynamic population structure influenced by the
   capacity of females to relocate among proximal breeding sites, although
   this may be conditional on large population sizes as existed
   historically across this region.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of founder events, random drift and new selective forces
   experienced by introduced species typically lowers genetic variation and
   induces differentiation from the ancestral population. Here, we
   investigate microsatellite differentiation between introduced and native
   populations of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus). Many
   expectations based on introduction history, such as loss of alleles and
   relationships among populations, are confirmed. Nevertheless, when
   applying population assignment methods to our data, we observe a few
   specimens that are incorrectly assigned and/or appear to have a mixed
   ancestry, despite estimates of substantial population differentiation.
   Thus, we suggest that population assignments of individuals should be
   viewed as tentative and that there should be agreement among different
   algorithms before assignments are applied in conservation or management.
   Further, we find no congruence between previously reported morphological
   differentiation and the sorting of microsatellite variation. Some
   introduced populations have retained much genetic variation while others
   have not, irrespective of morphology. Finally, we find alleles from the
   sympatric grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) in one small Indian
   mongoose within the native range, suggesting an alternative explanation
   for morphological differentiation involving a shift in female
   preferences in allopatry.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of new genetic variants or species is often caused by
   maritime transport between harbours. Botryllus schlosseri is a
   cosmopolitan ascidian species that is found in both harbours and open
   shore habitats. In order to determine the influence of ship traffic on
   the genetic structure and phylogeography of B. schlosseri in southern
   Europe, we analyzed the variability of a fragment of the mitochondrial
   gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). We sampled seven
   Atlanto-Mediterranean harbour populations and three open-shore
   populations. In addition, we sequenced some colonies from the
   US-Atlantic coast and from other Mediterranean localities to perform
   phylogenetic analyses. Although the number of polymorphic sites recorded
   (25.8\%) was within the range observed in other population studies based
   on ascidian COI sequences, the haplotypic diversity (16 haplotypes out
   of 181 sequences) was much lower. Moreover, a lack of intermediate
   haplotypes was observed. This pattern of high nucleotide diversity and
   low haplotype diversity was consistent with introduction events of a few
   divergent haplotypes. We found a strong genetic structure in the study
   populations. Gene flow was only appreciable between some harbour
   populations. Harbour- and open-shore populations were well
   differentiated, although there was no evidence for isolation by
   distance. A nested clade analysis pointed to long-distance colonization,
   possibly coupled with subsequent fragmentation, as the underlying
   process. Our results suggest that B. schlosseri entered the study area
   via harbour-hopping, possibly through recurrent introduction events. The
   haplotypes from North America and most of the European ones were grouped
   in the same phylogenetic clade. This suggests occasional gene flow
   between both continents, probably through ship transport.}},

Abstract = {{The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's major biodiversity
   hotspots and is threatened by a severe habitat loss. Yet little is known
   about the processes that originated its remarkable richness of endemic
   species. Here we present results of a large-scale survey of the genetic
   variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of the pitviper,
   jararaca lancehead (Bothrops jararaca), and two closely related insular
   species (Bothrops insularis and Bothrops alcatraz), endemic of this
   region. Phylogenetic and network analyses revealed the existence of two
   well-supported clades, exhibiting a southern and a northern
   distribution. The divergence time of these two phylogroups was estimated
   at 3.8 million years ago, in the Pliocene, a period of intense climatic
   changes and frequent fragmentation of the tropical rainforest. Our data
   also suggest that the two groups underwent a large size expansion
   between 50 000 and 100 000 years ago. However, the southern group showed
   a more marked signal of population size fluctuation than the northern
   group, corroborating evidences that southern forests may have suffered a
   more pronounced reduction in area in the late Pleistocene. The insular
   species B. alcatraz and B. insularis presented very low diversity, each
   one sharing haplotypes with mainland individuals placed in different
   subclades. Despite their marked morphological and behavioural
   uniqueness, these two insular species seem to have originated very
   recently and most likely from distinct costal B. jararaca populations,
   possibly associated with late Pleistocene or Holocene sea level
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive phenotypic polymorphism in the European whitefish has
   triggered evolutionary research in order to disentangle mechanisms
   underlying diversification. To illuminate the ecological distinctiveness
   in polymorphic whitefish, and evaluate taxonomic designations, we
   studied nine Norwegian lakes in three watercourses, which each harboured
   pairs of divergent whitefish morphs. We compared the morphology and life
   history of these morphs, documented the extent of genetic
   differentiation between them, and contrasted the niche use of sympatric
   morphs along both the habitat and resource axes. In all cases, sympatric
   morphs differed in the number of gill rakers, a highly heritable trait
   related to trophic utilization. Individual growth rate, age and size at
   maturity, diet and habitat use also differed between morphs within
   lakes, but were remarkably similar across lakes within the same morph.
   Microsatellite analyses confirmed for all but one pair that sympatric
   morphs were significantly genetically different, and that similar morphs
   from different lakes likely have a polyphyletic origin. These results
   are most compatible with the process of parallel evolution through
   recurrent postglacial divergence into pelagic and benthic niches in each
   of these lakes. We propose that sparsely and densely rakered whitefish
   sympatric pairs may be a likely case of ecological speciation, mediated
   in oligotrophic lakes with few trophic competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Palaeoecological studies have demonstrated that ecological communities
   as a whole did not remain stable throughout the climatic fluctuations of
   the Quaternary. The result is that long-term associations of species
   cannot be inferred by contemporary associations in ecological
   communities. Therefore, the evolutionary significance of any
   contemporary ecological interactions among species and of the biotic
   community within which species have evolved also cannot be assumed from
   contemporary conditions. Comparative phylogeographic data provide a
   method to identify species within ecological communities that have
   shared biogeographic histories. We present an example of a long-term
   association between populations of two mammalian species, eastern
   chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus),

   lineages of the two species have expanded from similar population
   sources since the Last Glacial Maximum. In addition, the spatial

Abstract = {{The evolution of reproductive isolation in the presence of gene flow is
   supported by theoretical models but rarely by data. Empirical support
   might be gained from studies of parallel hybrid zones between
   interbreeding taxa. We analysed gene flow over two hybrid zones
   separating ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis to test the expectation that
   neutral genetic markers will show site-specific differences if barriers
   have evolved in situ. Distinct ecotypes found in contrasting shore
   habitats are separated by divergent selection and poor dispersal, but
   hybrid zones appear between them. Swedish islands formed by postglacial
   uplift 5000 years ago provide opportunities to assess genetic structure
   in a recently evolved system. Each island houses a discrete population
   containing subpopulations of different ecotypes. Hybrid zones between
   ecotypes may be a product of ecological divergence occurring on each
   island or a consequence of secondary overlap of ecotypes of allopatric
   origin that have spread among the islands. We used six microsatellite
   loci to assess gene flow and genetic profiles of hybrid zones on two
   islands. We found reduced gene flow over both hybrid zones, indicating
   the presence of local reproductive barriers between ecotypes.
   Nevertheless, subpopulations of different ecotypes from the same island
   were genetically more similar to each other than were subpopulations of
   the same ecotype from different islands. Moreover, neutral genetic
   traits separating the two ecotypes across hybrid zones were
   site-specific. This supports a scenario of in situ origin of ecotypes by
   ecological divergence and nonallopatric evolution of reproductive
   barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Subspecies complexes may provide valuable insights into the early stages
   of the speciation process. The bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) consists of
   many morphologically distinct subspecies that differ most strikingly in
   the ornamental colour pattern of the male throat. We investigated the
   genetic and phenotypic differentiation in this subspecies complex, using
   (i) microsatellite genotyping (11 loci) of a sample of 364 individuals
   from bluethroat populations in Europe and Asia, and (ii) spectrometric
   and morphological measurements of a sample of 131 museum skin specimens.
   Population genetic analyses, based on microsatellite allele frequency
   variation, revealed a slight but significant overall population
   differentiation (F-ST = 0.042). There was a well-differentiated southern
   group of subspecies with white or no throat spots and a
   less-differentiated northern group of chestnut-spotted populations.
   Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the southern all-blue and
   white-spotted forms are ancestral to the chestnut-spotted subspecies. In
   addition to the qualitative variation in throat plumage pattern already
   described in the literature, we found significant quantitative variation
   among subspecies in hue, chroma and brightness of the ultraviolet
   (UV)/blue throat coloration, and this variation seemed to be unrelated
   to the phylogenetic distance between subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent investigations suggest that marine biodiversity may be much
   higher than earlier estimates, and an important hidden source of
   diversity in marine systems is the phenomenon of cryptic species
   complexes. Such complexes are informative models for research into the
   evolutionary processes that govern species compositions of marine fauna.
   The snapping shrimp genera Alpheus and Synalpheus are known to harbour
   large numbers of cryptic species; here, I characterize the genetic
   structure of the Alpheus armillatus species complex in the northern
   Caribbean, west Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico using mitochondrial and
   nuclear sequence data. Over this geographical region, the complex
   harbours at least three lineages that are probable reproductively
   isolated species; all major lineages diverged subsequent to the close of
   the Isthmus of Panama. Only one lineage was present in the Gulf of
   Mexico, whereas outside the Gulf of Mexico there was no clear tendency
   for lineage dominance by geographical region, as most sites were
   populated by shrimp from at least two lineages. However, within each
   lineage, there was strong evidence of population genetic differentiation
   between geographical regions. All lineages showed strong signals of
   demographic expansion, and one lineage showed sharply reduced genetic
   diversity, suggestive of past population bottlenecks or recently founded
   populations with low gene flow from other sites. These results show that
   evolutionary processes leading to divergence and speciation have been
   common and recent in the snapping shrimp, and suggest that connectivity
   among shrimp populations may be limited.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil pollen records indicate that Hippophae rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn)
   was widespread on late- and early postglacial raw soils throughout much
   of central and northern Europe, but that Early Holocene reforestation
   restricted populations to northern coastal habitats, or along mountain
   streams in the Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians. We used sequence
   variation at the nuclear chalcone synthase intron (Chsi), in conjunction
   with chloroplast DNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism data, to
   investigate the intraspecific phylogeny, phylogeographic structure, and
   expansion demographic history of this dioecious and wind-pollinated
   shrub at its range-wide scale in Europe and Asia Minor. Four major Chsi
   phylogroups of unresolved relationships were identified with estimated
   divergences similar to 172 000 years ago. Large-scale phylogeographic
   structures of nuclear and cytoplasmic markers were congruent in
   identifying (i) southeastern Europe as the most likely source of
   colonization into central Europe and Scandinavia, and (ii) the area just
   north of the Alps as a contact zone between populations from the Alps
   and the east/central European-Scandinavian lineage. Coalescence-based
   analyses (i.e. nested clade analysis and mismatch distributions) of Chsi
   variation were able to detect at least four major episodes of population
   growth, all within about the last 40 000 years. In particular, these
   analyses identified a nearly synchronized timing of population
   expansions in various parts of the species' range in central-eastern
   Europe/Asia Minor, most likely correlating with the Younger Dryas
   Stadial (similar to 13 000-11 600 years ago). It remains to be
   established whether the phylogeographic history of H. rhamnoides, and
   particularly its rapid response to the rapid environmental changes of
   the Younger Dryas cold snap, is unique to the species, or whether it is
   shared with other cold-tolerant shrub (or grassland) species known from
   late-glacial raw soils in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeography allows the inference of evolutionary processes that have
   shaped the current distribution of genealogical lineages across a
   landscape. In this perspective, comparative phylogeographical analyses
   are useful in detecting common historical patterns by either comparing
   different species within the same area within a continent or by
   comparing similar species in different areas. Here, we analyse one taxon
   (the white oak, genus Quercus, subgenus Quercus, section Quercus) that
   is widespread worldwide, and we evaluate its phylogeographical pattern
   on two different continents: western North America and Western Europe.
   The goals of the present study are: (i) to compare the chloroplast
   genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in
   the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian
   Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes
   between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for
   the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six
   maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar
   sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the
   differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian
   species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes
   (39 vs. 11 in the European white oak complex). Furthermore, in
   California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while
   in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages
   partitioned longitudinally. These contrasted patterns could indicate
   that gene movement in California oak populations have been more stable
   in response to past climatic and geological events, in contrast to their
   European counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The intertidal biota of the North Atlantic is characterized by two
   disjunct communities (North American and European) exposed to different

   sides of the North Atlantic throughout the last two glacial maxima (>
   202 000 years) with little trans-Atlantic gene flow since divergence,
   very little structure among populations within Europe (Phi(ST) < 0.05)

   0.0-0.21). Although the ecological flexibility and high local migration
   of P. gunnellus could have enhanced this species' survival across the

   trans-Atlantic persistence when considering 12 other North Atlantic
   phylogeographical studies from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Cathaya argyrophylla is an endangered conifer restricted to subtropical
   mountains of China. To study phylogeographical pattern and demographic
   history of C. argyrophylla, species-wide genetic variation was
   investigated using sequences of maternally inherited mtDNA and
   biparentally inherited nuclear DNA. Of 15 populations sampled from all
   four distinct regions, only three mitotypes were detected at two loci,
   without single region having a mixed composition (G(ST) = 1). Average
   nucleotide diversity (theta(ws) = 0.0024; pi(s) = 0.0029) across eight
   nuclear loci is significantly lower than those found for other conifers
   (theta(ws) = 0.003 similar to 0.015; pi(s) = 0.002 similar to 0.012)
   based on estimates of multiple loci. Because of its highest diversity
   among the eight nuclear loci and evolving neutrally, one locus (2009)
   was further used for phylogeographical studies and eight haplotypes
   resulting from 12 polymorphic sites were obtained from 98 individuals.
   All the four distinct regions had at least four haplotypes, with the
   Dalou region (DL) having the highest diversity and the Bamian region
   (BM) the lowest, paralleling the result of the eight nuclear loci. An
   AMOVA revealed significant proportion of diversity attributable to
   differences among regions (13.4\%) and among populations within regions
   (8.9\%). F-ST analysis also indicated significantly high differentiation
   among populations (F-ST = 0.22) and between regions (F-ST = 0.12-0.38).
   Non-overlapping distribution of mitotypes and high genetic
   differentiation among the distinct geographical groups suggest the
   existence of at least four separate glacial refugia. Based on network
   and mismatch distribution analyses, we do not find evidence of long
   distance dispersal and population expansion in C. argyrophylla. Ex situ
   conservation and artificial crossing are recommended for the management
   of this endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and climate change are two major threats on
   biodiversity. Fragmentation limits the number of patches and their
   decreased connectivity cannot always maintain populations at dynamic
   equilibrium. The natural extreme fragmentation of marine cave habitats
   represents an opportunity to understand how these processes interact.
   The hypothesis of a low gene flow among populations due to a high level
   of fragmentation was tested by analysing sequence variation in a
   fragment of the mitochondrial gene of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I
   in 170 individuals (23 localities across the NW Mediterranean) of two
   marine cave-dwelling mysids of the genus Hemimysis. The species
   Hemimysis margalefi recently replaced its congener Hemimysis speluncola,
   a species shift that could be related to the warming of the
   Mediterranean Sea and to differences in their thermal tolerances. There
   were too few H. speluncola samples to further discuss their genetic
   structuring, but for H. margalefi, the present study revealed high
   levels of genetic diversity and genetic structuring, as shown by the
   eight genetically distinct groups identified. The Croatian group might
   constitute a sibling species due to a strong divergence (15\%).
   Nevertheless, these groups present reduced but orientated gene flow
   according to the general circulation in the Mediterranean, and fit a
   stepping-stone model. At local scale (Marseille area, France), gene flow
   among caves is dependent on unexpected local hydrodynamic barriers, that
   determine metapopulation sizes. Through the example of mysid species
   inhabiting marine caves, the present work confirms the strong influence
   of habitat disjunction (natural fragmentation) on population structure,
   and stresses the importance of coastal geomorphological features in
   inducing complex interactions between the circulation of water masses
   and the circulation of genes.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection is an important force driving the evolution of
   morphological and genetic traits. To determine the importance of
   male-male, postcopulatory sexual selection in natural populations of
   house mice, we estimated the frequency of multiple paternity, defined as
   the frequency with which a pregnant female carried a litter fertilized
   by more than one male. By genotyping eight microsatellite markers from
   1095 mice, we found evidence of multiple paternity from 33 of 143.
   Evidence for multiple paternity was especially strong for 29 of these
   litters. Multiple paternity was significantly more common in
   higher-density vs. lower-density populations. Any estimate of multiple
   paternity will be an underestimate of the frequency of multiple mating,
   defined as the frequency with which a female mates with more than a
   single male during a single oestrus cycle. We used computer simulations
   to estimate the frequency of multiple mating, incorporating observed
   reductions in heterozygosity and levels of allele sharing among mother
   and father. These simulations indicated that multiple mating is common,
   occurring in at least 20\% of all oestrus cycles. The exact estimate
   depends on the competitive skew among males, a parameter for which we
   currently have no data from natural populations. This study suggests
   that sperm competition is an important aspect of postcopulatory sexual
   selection in house mice.}},

Abstract = {{In the majority of birds and mammals, social monogamy is not congruent

   red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), a species in which social
   monogamy has been demonstrated in the laboratory, and 28\% of
   individuals in the forest are found in male-female pairs in the
   noncourtship season. We collected 16 clutches of eggs of P. cinereus in
   the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and collected tail
   clippings from attending mothers. We genotyped embryos and adults at
   five microsatellite loci in order to analyse paternity of clutches. Most
   clutches (84.6\%) had multiple sires, with two to three sires per
   clutch. In this study, 25\% of clutches had males in addition to females
   attending eggs. None of the mothers of these clutches were genetically
   monogamous. All attending males sired some of the offspring in the
   clutch that they attended (between 9\% and 50\%) but never sired a

Abstract = {{Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica) and its seed predator, the
   camellia weevil (Curculio camelliae), provide a notable example of a
   geographic mosaic of coevolution. In the species interaction, the
   offensive trait of the weevil (rostrum length) and the defensive trait
   of the plant (pericarp thickness) are involved in a
   geographically-structured arms race, and these traits and selective
   pressures acting on the plant defence vary greatly across a geographical
   landscape. To further explore the geographical structure of this
   interspecific interaction, we tested whether the geographical variation
   in the weevil rostrum over an 800-km range along latitude is attributed
   to local natural selection or constrained by historical
   (phylogeographical) events of local populations. Phylogeographical
   analyses of the mitochondrial DNA sequences of the camellia weevil
   revealed that this species has experienced differentiation into two
   regions, with a population bottleneck and subsequent range and/or
   population expansion within each region. Although these
   phylogeographical factors have affected the variation in rostrum length,
   analyses of competing factors for the geographical variation revealed
   that this pattern is primarily determined by the defensive trait of the
   host plant rather than by the effects of historical events of
   populations and a climatic factor (annual mean temperature). Thus, our
   study suggests the overwhelming strength of coevolutionary selection
   against the effect of historical events, which may have limited local
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Endosymbioses are a major form of biological complexity affecting the
   ecological and evolutionary diversification of many eukaryotic groups.
   These associations are exemplified by nutritional symbioses of insects
   for which phylogenetic studies have demonstrated numerous cases of
   long-term codiversification between a bacterial and a host lineage. Some
   insects, including most leafhoppers (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae),
   have more than one bacterial symbiont within specialized host cells,
   raising questions regarding the patterns of codiversification of these
   multiple partners and the evolutionary persistence of complex symbiotic
   systems. Previous studies reported the presence of two dominant symbiont
   types in a member of the leafhopper subfamily Cicadellinae
   (sharpshooters). In this study, 16S rRNA sequences were obtained and
   used to examine the occurrence and evolutionary relationships of the two
   dominant symbiont types across 29 leafhopper species. Candidatus Sulcia
   muelleri (Bacteroidetes) was detected in all leafhopper species
   examined, a finding that is consistent with a previous report of its
   ancient association with the Auchenorrhyncha (a grouping that includes
   leafhoppers, treehoppers, cicadas, planthoppers, and spittlebugs).
   Baumannia cicadellinicola (Proteobacteria), previously known from only
   five sharpshooter species, was found only in the sharpshooter tribes
   Cicadellini and Proconiini, as well as in the subfamily Phereurhininae.
   Mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences were obtained and used to
   reconstruct host phylogenies. Analyses of host and symbiont data sets
   support a congruent evolutionary history between sharpshooters, Sulcia
   and Baumannia and thus provide the first strong evidence for long-term
   co-inheritance of multiple symbionts during the diversification of a
   eukaryotic host. Sulcia shows a fivefold lower rate of 16S rDNA sequence
   divergence than does Baumannia for the same host pairs. The term
   `coprimary' symbiont is proposed for such cases.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally assumed that larvae of benthic species are thoroughly
   mixed in the plankton and distributed randomly at settlement. Yet, it
   has also been hypothesized that a combination of larval gregarious
   behaviour coupled with particular oceanographic conditions may prevent
   larvae from mixing completely, and result in nonrandom spatial
   distributions following settlement. Using microsatellite markers, the
   main objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of
   statistical connections between relatedness and settlement in the
   intertidal acorn barnacle from the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. A second
   objective was to test the hypothesis that patches of kin-related
   individuals came from a common parental site. Our results indicated that
   a significant number of barnacles within a given sample were more
   closely related than expected by chance despite the enormous potential
   for admixture during the planktonic phase. Thus, eight out of 37 samples
   analysed had relatedness values significantly higher than expected from
   random settlement. Moreover, analyses of sibship network construction
   and network complexity tests provided evidence for the occurrence of
   networks within several samples that were characterized by strong
   connections among individuals. Thus, nonrandom planktonic dispersal
   associated with relatively stable oceanic currents, as well as
   additional ecological factors to be rigorously investigated (e.g.
   behavioural mechanisms), may be more important in determining patterns
   of genetic structure in marine benthic invertebrates than generally
   assumed. Therefore, documenting genetic patterns associated with kin
   aggregation should be a fruitful and an important avenue for future
   studies in marine invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an Arabidopsis thaliana/Myzus persicae model system to
   allow the dissection of plant/insect interactions at a molecular genetic
   level. This allows the examination of the role of single plant genes in
   the interaction between the plant and an aphid. Our initial studies have
   exploited an Arabidopsis genotype in which the function of the amino
   acid transporter ANT1 has been abolished. This mutation results in a
   change in the proportions of several amino acids within the phloem sieve
   elements (SEs) resulting in an increase in the proportion of essential
   amino acids. This has been measured using aphid stylectomy to collect SE
   samples, followed by a novel micellar electrokinetic chromatography
   method for amino acid analysis. The SE content represents the aphid's
   diet, and use of electrical penetration graph technology and honeydew
   clocks have demonstrated that this altered diet results in a change in
   the feeding rate of the aphid. Balance sheets can be produced to show
   the amount (nmoles/24 h) of each of 18 amino acids taken up and excreted
   by aphids feeding on wild type and ant1 mutant plants. The data show
   that aphids feeding on the ant1 mutant take up larger amounts of amino
   acids. However, we could not detect any effect on the reproductive rate
   of the aphids. The results show that, under experimental conditions,
   this model system can be used to identify plant genes that control the
   behaviour and fecundity of an insect pest.}},

   regional scales. Although recent studies found that host plant genetic
   composition can structure local dependent herbivore communities, the
   abiotic environment is a stronger factor than the genetic effect at
   increasingly larger spatial scales. In contrast to these studies we
   found that dependent arthropod community structure is correlated with
   both the cross type composition of cottonwoods and individual genotypes
   within local rivers up to the regional scale of 720 000 km(2) (Four
   Corner States region in the southwestern USA). Across this geographical
   extent comprising two naturally hybridizing cottonwood systems, the
   arthropod community follows a simple genetic similarity rule:
   genetically similar trees support more similar arthropod communities
   than trees that are genetically dissimilar. This relationship can be
   quantified with or without genetic data in Populus.}},

Abstract = {{The degree of population structure within species often varies
   considerably among loci. This makes it difficult to determine whether
   observed variance reflects neutral-drift stochasticity or locus-specific
   selection at one or more loci. This uncertainty is exacerbated when
   evolutionary equilibrium cannot be assumed and/or admixture potentially
   inflates genomic variance. Thus, the value of a `genome scan', where
   locus-specific summary statistics are compared with a simulated neutral
   distribution among loci, may be limited in secondary contact zones if
   the null distribution is sensitive to the timing of secondary contact.
   Of particular interest here is the wide variance previously observed in
   locus-specific patterns of population structure between Atlantic and
   Gulf of Mexico populations of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. To
   test the robustness of an equilibrium null model, we compared
   among-locus distributions of F-ST simulated under migration-drift
   equilibrium and several nonequilibrium secondary contact histories. We
   then tested for evidence of divergent selection between two oyster
   populations on either side of a secondary contact zone using 215
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. Constant-migration
   equilibrium and nonequilibrium secondary-contact simulations produced
   equivalent distributions of F-ST when anchored by the global mean F-ST
   observed in oysters, 0.0917. The 99th quantile of simulated neutral F-ST
   encompassed most of the variation among oyster loci. Three AFLP loci
   exhibited F-ST values higher than this threshold. Although no locus was
   significant after correcting for multiple tests, our results show in
   geographically clinal organisms: AFLPs can efficiently characterize the
   genomic distribution of F-ST; equilibrium models can be used to evaluate
   outliers; these procedures help focus research on genomic regions of
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about genetically modified (GM) crops include transgene flow to
   compatible wild species and unintended ecological consequences of
   potential transgene introgression. However, there has been little
   empirical documentation of establishment and distribution of transgenic
   plants in wild populations. We present herein the first evidence for
   escape of transgenes into wild plant populations within the USA;
   glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) plants
   expressing CP4 EPSPS transgenes were found outside of cultivation area
   in central Oregon. Resident populations of three compatible Agrostis
   species were sampled in nonagronomic habitats outside the Oregon
   Department of Agriculture control area designated for test production of
   glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass. CP4 EPSPS protein and the
   corresponding transgene were found in nine A. stolonifera plants
   screened from 20 400 samples (0.04 +/- 0.01\% SE). CP4 EPSPS-positive
   plants were located predominantly in mesic habitats downwind and up to
   3.8 km beyond the control area perimeter; two plants were found within
   the USDA Crooked River National Grassland. Spatial distribution and
   parentage of transgenic plants (as confirmed by analyses of nuclear ITS
   and chloroplast matK gene trees) suggest that establishment resulted
   from both pollen-mediated intraspecific hybridizations and from crop
   seed dispersal. These results demonstrate that transgene flow from
   short-term production can result in establishment of transgenic plants
   at multi-kilometre distances from GM source fields or plants. Selective
   pressure from direct application or drift of glyphosate herbicide could
   enhance introgression of CP4 EPSPS transgenes and additional
   establishment. Obligatory outcrossing and vegetative spread could
   further contribute to persistence of CP4 EPSPS transgenes in wild
   Agrostis populations, both in the presence or absence of herbicide
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Insects comprise the largest species composition in the entire animal
   kingdom and possess a vast undiscovered genetic diversity and gene pool
   that can be better explored using molecular marker techniques. Current
   trends of application of DNA marker techniques in diverse domains of
   insect ecological studies show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
   microsatellites, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), expressed
   sequence tags (EST) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   markers have contributed significantly for progresses towards
   understanding genetic basis of insect diversity and for mapping
   medically and agriculturally important genes and quantitative trait loci
   in insect pests. Apart from these popular marker systems, other novel
   approaches including transposon display, sequence-specific amplification
   polymorphism (S-SAP), repeat-associated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   markers have been identified as alternate marker systems in insect
   studies. Besides, whole genome microarray and single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) assays are becoming more popular to screen
   genome-wide polymorphisms in fast and cost effective manner. However,
   use of such methodologies has not gained widespread popularity in
   entomological studies. The current study highlights the recent trends of
   applications of molecular markers in insect studies and explores the
   technological advancements in molecular marker tools and modern high
   throughput genotyping methodologies that may be applied in entomological
   researches for better understanding of insect ecology at molecular

Abstract = {{Small populations at the edge of a species' distribution can represent
   evolutionary relics left behind after range contractions due to climate
   change or human exploitation. The distinctiveness and genetic diversity
   of a small population of bottlenose whales in the Gully, a submarine
   canyon off Nova Scotia, was quantified by comparison to other North
   Atlantic populations using 10 microsatellites and mitrochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) control region sequences (434 bp). Both markers confirmed the
   distinctiveness of the Gully (n = 34) from the next nearest population,
   off Labrador (n = 127; microsatellites - F-ST = 0.0243, P < 0.0001;
   mtDNA - Phi(ST) = 0.0456, P < 0.05). Maximum likelihood microsatellite
   estimates suggest that less than two individuals per generation move
   between these areas, refuting the hypothesis of population links through
   seasonal migration. Both males and females appear to be philopatric,
   based on significant differentiation at both genomes and similar levels
   of structuring among the sexes for microsatellites. mtDNA diversity was
   very low in all populations (h = 0.51, pi = 0.14\%), a pattern which may
   be due to selective sweeps associated with this species' extreme
   deep-diving ecology. Whaling had a substantial impact on bottlenose
   whale abundance, with over 65 000 animals killed before the hunt ceased
   in the early 1970s. Genetic diversity was similar among all populations,
   however, and no signal for bottlenecks was detected, suggesting that the
   Gully is not a relic of a historically wider distribution. Instead, this
   unique ecosystem appears to have long provided a stable year-round
   habitat for a distinct population of bottlenose whales.}},

Abstract = {{All colonies of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes natalensis
   studied so far are associated with a single genetically variable lineage
   of Termitomyces symbionts. Such limited genetic variation of symbionts
   and the absence of sexual fruiting bodies (mushrooms) on M. natalensis
   mounds would be compatible with clonal vertical transmission, as is
   known to occur in Macrotermes bellicosus. We investigated this
   hypothesis by analysing DNA sequence polymorphisms as codominant SNP
   markers of four single-copy gene fragments of Termitomyces isolates from
   31 colonies of M. natalensis. A signature of free recombination was
   found, indicative of frequent sexual horizontal transmission. First, all
   31 strains had unique multilocus genotypes. Second, SNP markers (n = 55)
   were largely in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (90.9\%) and almost all
   possible pairs of SNPs between genetically unlinked loci were in linkage
   equilibrium (96.7\%). Finally, extensive intragenic recombination was
   found, especially in the EF1 alpha fragment. Substantial genetic
   variation and a freely recombining population structure can only be
   explained by frequent horizontal and sexual transmission of
   Termitomyces. The apparent variation in symbiont transmission mode among
   Macrotermes species implies that vertical symbiont transmission can
   evolve rapidly. The unexpected finding of horizontal transmission makes
   the apparent absence of Termitomyces mushrooms on M. natalensis mounds
   puzzling. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of the
   genetic population structure of a single lineage of Termitomyces.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperatively breeding species, restricted dispersal of offspring
   leads to clustering of closely related individuals, increasing the
   potential both for indirect genetic benefits and inbreeding costs. In
   apostlebirds (Struthidea cinerea), philopatry by both sexes results in
   the formation of large (up to 17 birds), predominantly sedentary
   breeding groups that remain stable throughout the year. We examined
   patterns of relatedness and fine-scale genetic structure within a
   population of apostlebirds using six polymorphic microsatellite loci. We
   found evidence of fine-scale genetic structure within the study
   population that is consistent with behavioural observations of
   short-distance dispersal, natal philopatry by both sexes and restricted
   movement of breeding groups between seasons. Global F-ST values among
   breeding groups were significantly positive, and the average level of
   pairwise relatedness was significantly higher for individuals within
   groups than between groups. For individuals from different breeding
   groups, geographical distance was negatively correlated with pairwise
   relatedness and positively correlated with pairwise F-ST. However, when
   each sex was examined separately, this pattern was significant only
   among males, suggesting that females may disperse over longer distances.
   We discuss the potential for kin selection to influence the evolution
   and maintenance of cooperative breeding in apostlebirds. Our results
   demonstrate that spatial genetic structural analysis offers a useful
   alternative to field observations in examining dispersal patterns of
   cooperative breeders.}},

Abstract = {{Song divergence among populations of passerine birds is recognized as a
   potentially important premating isolation mechanism and may represent
   the first step in speciation. Because song divergence may be influenced
   by an array of acoustic, ecological, and genetic factors, the study of
   its origin requires a multifaceted approach. Here we describe the
   relationship between acoustic, neutral genetic and ecological variation
   in five populations of the Swainson's thrush: two from coastal temperate
   rainforest habitat representing the `russet-backed' subspecies group,
   two from inland coniferous forest habitat representing the
   `olive-backed' subspecies group, and one mixed locality that resides
   within a contact zone between the two groups. Song in the five
   populations is analysed using a multivariate analysis of spectral and
   temporal measurements, population genetic structure is assessed using an
   analysis of five microsatellite loci and ecological differences between
   populations are quantified using an analysis of climatic parameters.
   Matrix correspondence tests are used to distinguish between the
   potential for drift and selection in driving song divergence. No
   significant correlation was found between acoustic and genetic distance
   suggesting that song divergence cannot be explained by drift alone. A
   significant correlation between ecological and acoustic distance after
   accounting for genetic distance, suggests a potential role for
   ecological selection on divergence in spectral and temporal components
   of Swainson's thrush song.}},

Abstract = {{Assignment tests are increasingly applied in ecology and conservation,
   although empirical comparisons of methods are still rare or are
   restricted to few of the available approaches. Furthermore, the
   performance of assignment tests in cases with low population
   differentiation, violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and unbalanced
   sampling designs has not been verified. The release of adult hatchery
   steelhead to spawn in Forks Creek in 1996 and 1997 provided an
   opportunity to compare the power of different assignment methods to
   distinguish their offspring from those of sympatric wild steelhead. We
   compared standard assignment methods requiring baseline samples
   (frequency, distance and Bayesian) and clustering approaches with and
   without baseline information, using six freely available computer
   programs. Assignments were verified by parentage data obtained for a
   subset of returning offspring. All methods provided similar assignment
   success, despite low differentiation between wild and hatchery fish
   (F-ST = 0.02). Bayesian approaches with baseline data performed best,
   whereas the results of clustering methods were variable and depended on
   the samples included in the analysis and the availability of baseline
   information. Removal of a locus with null alleles and equalizing sample
   sizes had little effect on assignments. Our results demonstrate the
   robustness of most assignment tests to low differentiation and
   violations of assumptions, as well as their utility for ecological
   studies that require correct classification of different groups.}},

Abstract = {{Isolation by distance is usually tested by the correlation of genetic
   and geographic distances separating all pairwise populations'
   combinations. However, this method can be significantly biased by only a
   few highly diverged populations and lose the information of individual
   population. To detect outlier populations and investigate the relative
   strengths of gene flow and genetic drift for each population, we propose
   a decomposed pairwise regression analysis. This analysis was applied to
   the well-described one-dimensional stepping-stone system of
   stream-dwelling Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma). When genetic and
   geographic distances were plotted for all pairs of 17 tributary
   populations, the correlation was significant but weak (r(2) = 0.184).
   Seven outlier populations were determined based on the systematic bias
   of the regression residuals, followed by Akaike's information criteria.
   The best model, 10 populations included, showed a strong pattern of
   isolation by distance (r(2) = 0.758), suggesting equilibrium between
   gene flow and genetic drift in these populations. Each outlier
   population was also analysed by plotting pairwise genetic and geographic
   distances against the 10 nonoutlier populations, and categorized into
   one of the three patterns: strong genetic drift, genetic drift with a
   limited gene flow and a high level of gene flow. These classifications
   were generally consistent with a priori predictions for each population
   (physical barrier, population size, anthropogenic impacts). Combined the
   genetic analysis with field observations, Dolly Varden in this river
   appeared to form a mainland-island or source-sink metapopulation
   structure. The generality of the method will merit many types of spatial
   genetic analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular forensic methods are being increasingly used to help enforce
   wildlife conservation laws. Using multilocus genotyping, illegal
   translocation of an animal can be demonstrated by excluding all
   potential source populations as an individual's population of origin.
   Here, we illustrate how this approach can be applied to a large
   continuous population by defining the population genetic structure and
   excluding suspect animals from each identified cluster. We aimed to test
   the hypothesis that recreational hunters had illegally introduced a
   group of red deer into a hunting area in Luxembourg. Reference samples
   were collected over a large area in order to test the possibility that
   the suspect individuals might be recent immigrants. Due to
   isolation-by-distance relationships in the data set, inferring the
   number of genetic clusters using Bayesian methods was not
   straightforward. Biologically meaningful clusters were only obtained by
   simultaneously analysing spatial and genetic information using the
   program (BAPS) 4.1. We inferred the presence of three genetic clusters
   in the study region. Using partial Mantel tests, we detected barriers to
   gene flow other than distance, probably created by a combination of
   urban areas, motorways and a river valley used for viticulture. The four
   focal animals could be excluded with a high certainty from the three
   genetic subpopulations and it was therefore likely that they had been
   released illegally..}},

Abstract = {{We used genotypes from six microsatellite loci and demographic data from
   a large mapped forest plot to study changes in spatial genetic structure
   across demographic stages, from seed rain to seedlings, juveniles, and
   adult diameter classes in the Neotropical tree, Jacaranda copaia. In
   pairwise comparisons of genetic differentiation among demographic
   classes, only seedlings were significantly differentiated from the other
   diameter classes; F-ST values ranged from 0.006 to 0.009. Furthermore,
   only seedlings showed homozygote excess suggesting biparental inbreeding
   in the large diameter reproductive adults. We found very low levels of
   relatedness in the first distance class of trees, 1-26 cm diameter (F-ij
   = 0.011). However, there was a 5- to 10-fold rise in relatedness in the
   smallest distance class, from the smallest to the largest tree diameter
   classes (F-ij = 0.110 for individuals > 56 cm diameter). A variety of
   non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been invoked perviously to
   explain such a pattern, including natural selection, history, or
   nonequilibrium population dynamics. The long-term demographic data
   available for this species allow us to evaluate these mechanisms.
   Jacaranda is a fast-growing, light-demanding species with low
   recruitment rates and high mortality rates in the smaller diameter
   classes. It successfully regenerates only in large light gaps, which
   occur infrequently and stochastically in space and time. These factors
   contribute to the nonequilibrium population dynamics and observed low
   genetic structure in the small size classes. We conclude that the
   pattern of spatial genetic transitions in Jacaranda is consistent with
   overlapping related generations and strong but infrequent periods of
   high recruitment, followed by long periods of population decline.}},

Title = {{Evidence of microsatellite hitch-hiking selection in Atlantic cod (Gadus

Abstract = {{Microsatellites have gained wide application for elucidating population
   structure in nonmodel organisms. Since they are generally noncoding,
   neutrality is assumed but rarely tested. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua
   L.), microsatellite studies have revealed highly heterogeneous estimates
   of genetic differentiation among loci. In particular one locus, Gmo 132,
   has demonstrated elevated genetic differentiation. We investigated
   possible hitchhiking selection at this and other microsatellite loci in
   Atlantic cod. We employed 11 loci for analysing samples from the Baltic
   Sea, North Sea, Barents Sea and Newfoundland covering a large part of
   the species' distributional range. The `classical' Lewontin-Krakauer
   test for selection based on variance in estimates of F-ST and G'(ST)
   (standardized genetic differentiation) revealed only one significant
   pairwise test (North Sea-Barents Sea), and the source of the elevated
   variance could not be ascribed exclusively to Gmo 132. In contrast,
   different variants of the recently developed ln R theta. test for
   selective sweeps at microsatellite loci revealed a high number of
   significant outcomes of pair-wise tests for Gmo 132. Further, the
   presence of selection was indicated in at least one other locus. The
   results suggest that many previous estimates of genetic differentiation
   in cod based on microsatellites are inflated, and in some cases
   relationships among populations are obscured by one or more loci being
   the subject to hitch-hiking selection. Likewise, temporal estimates of
   effective population sizes in Atlantic cod may be flawed. We recommend,
   generally, to use a higher number of microsatellite loci to elucidate
   population structure in marine fishes and other nonmodel species to
   allow for identification of outlier loci that are subject to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) systems in plants exhibit high
   polymorphism at the SI controlling S-locus because individuals with rare
   alleles have a higher probability to successfully pollinate other plants
   than individuals with more frequent alleles. This process, referred to
   as frequency-dependent selection, is expected to shape number, frequency
   distribution, and spatial distribution of self-incompatibility alleles
   in natural populations. We investigated the genetic diversity and the
   spatial genetic structure within a Prunus avium population at two
   contrasting gene loci: nuclear microsatellites and the S-locus. The
   S-locus revealed a higher diversity (15 alleles) than the eight
   microsatellites (4-12 alleles). Although the frequency distribution of
   S-alleles differed significantly from the expected equal distribution,
   the S-locus showed a higher evenness than the microsatellites (Shannon's
   evenness index for the S-locus: E = 0.91; for the microsatellites: E =
   0.48-0.83). Also, highly significant deviations from neutrality were
   found for the S-locus whereas only minor deviations were found for two
   of eight microsatellites. A comparison of the frequency distribution of
   S-alleles in three age-cohorts revealed no significant differences,
   suggesting that different levels of selection acting on the S-locus or
   on S-linked sites might also affect the distribution and dynamics of
   S-alleles. Autocorrelation analysis revealed a weak but significant
   spatial genetic structure for the multilocus average of the
   microsatellites and for the S-locus, but could not ascertain differences
   in the extent of spatial genetic structure between these locus types. An
   indirect estimate of gene dispersal, which was obtained to explain this
   spatial genetic pattern, indicated high levels of gene dispersal within
   our population (sigma(g) = 106 m). This high gene dispersal, which may
   be partly due to the self-incompatibility system itself, aids the
   effective gene flow of the microsatellites, thereby decreasing the
   contrast between the neutral microsatellites and the S-locus.}},

Abstract = {{We examined large-scale patterns of morphology, genetic structure and
   ecological correlates of Fraxinus excelsior and the closely related
   species Fraxinus angustifolia in France, in order to determine the
   degree of hybridization between them. We sampled 24 populations in two
   putative hybrid zones (Loire and Saone), and five control populations of
   each species. We measured foliar characteristics of adult trees and used
   five nuclear microsatellites as molecular markers. Canonical
   discriminant analysis indicated that the two species differ in
   morphology, but that intermediate types are common in the Loire region
   but less frequent in the Saone region. Bayesian population assignment
   identified one F. angustifolia and two F. excelsior gene pools. Most
   Loire individuals clustered genetically with the F. angustifolia gene
   pool. In contrast, the Saone region presented individuals belonging
   mostly to F. excelsior pools, although the F. angustifolia type was
   frequent in certain populations. The lowest F-ST values were found
   between the Loire and F. angustifolia controls that also exhibited no
   significant isolation by distance. The proportion of the F. angustifolia
   gene pool in each locality was negatively correlated with winter
   temperatures, suggesting that a cold climate may be limiting.
   Hybridization is probably favoured by the intermediate climatic
   conditions in the Loire region that allow both species to occur, but is
   somewhat hampered by the harsher winters in the Saone area where
   morphological introgression has apparently not yet occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Cook Strait, which separates the North and South Island of New Zealand,
   has been a transient, but re-occurring feature of the New Zealand land
   mass throughout the Pleistocene, maintaining its current width and depth
   for the past 5000 years. Historic land fragmentation coupled with the
   complex hydrography of the Greater Cook Strait region has created both
   biogeographic and phylogeographic disjunctions between the North and
   South Island in several marine species. Here we use mitochondrial
   cytochrome bDNA sequences of three endemic intertidal limpets, Cellana
   ornata, Cellana radians and Cellana flava to assess intraspecific
   phylogeographic patterns across Cook Strait and to look for
   interspecific concordance of ecological and evolutionary processes among
   closely related taxa. We sequenced 328-359 bp in 85-321 individuals from
   8-31 populations spanning the biogeographic range of the three species.
   Intraspecific phylogeographic analyses show moderate to strong genetic
   discontinuity among North and South Island populations due to allopatric
   fragmentation. This pattern was broadly concordant across the three
   species and the observed divergence among this group of intertidal
   limpets (0.3-2.0\%) is similar to that of previously studied subtidal
   organisms. For each species, divergence time calculations suggest
   contemporary North and South Island lineages diverged from their
   respective most recent common ancestor approximately 200 000 to 300 000
   years before present (BP), significantly earlier than previous estimates
   in other coastal marine taxa that arose from a miscalculation of
   divergence time.}},

Abstract = {{The Veronica alpina complex comprises eight species of alpine habitats
   over a wide range of mountain systems in the Northern Hemisphere. The
   occurrence of sympatric species in the European and North American
   mountain systems allowed us not only to investigate the effect of the
   ice ages on intraspecific phylogeographical patterns and genetic
   diversity in different continents of the Northern Hemisphere, but also
   to compare these patterns in closely related species. Plastid DNA trnL-F
   sequences and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) fingerprints
   were used to infer the phylogenetic history of the group and
   phylogeographical patterns within species. Hybrid origin of tetraploid
   eastern North American V. wormskjoldii from western North American V.
   nutans (= V. wormskjoldii s.l.) and Eurasian V. alpina is suggested. A
   number of phylogeographical groups have been found both in V. alpina
   from Europe and in V. nutans from western North America.
   Phylogeographical substructuring in the Alps is inferred for V. alpina
   but not for V. bellidioides, which is moreover characterized by an
   overall very low genetic diversity. Western North American V. cusickii
   is much more genetically diverse than its sympatric relative, V. nutans,
   an effect that is likely due to differences in the breeding system.
   Populations of V. nutans are differentiated into three groups, those
   from the Cascades and from the southern and the northern Rocky
   Mountains. Genetic diversity seems to be higher in the North American V.
   nutans than in the morphologically and ecologically similar European V.
   alpina. A possible scenario to explain this pattern is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic structures of two weakly dispersing Mysis sibling
   species, one with a circumarctic coastal, the other with a boreal
   lacustrine-Baltic distribution, were studied from mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences. Mysis segerstralei
   showed high overall diversity and little phylogeographic structure
   across the Arctic, indicating late-glacial dispersal among coastal and
   lake populations from Alaska, Siberia and the north of Europe. A
   strongly divergent refugial lineage was however identified in Beringia.
   The boreal `glacial relict' Mysis salemaai in turn displayed clear
   structuring among postglacially isolated Scandinavian lake populations.
   The inferred pattern of intralake mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) monophyly in
   Scandinavia suggested relatively small population sizes and a remarkably
   fast postglacial mtDNA divergence rate (0.27\% per 10 000 years).
   Nevertheless, the broader phylogeographic pattern did not support
   distinct eastern and western glacial refugia in Northern Europe, unlike
   in some other aquatic taxa. In all, the two species comprised three
   equidistant mitochondrial lineages (approximately 2\% divergence),
   corresponding to M. salemaai, to the bulk of M. segerstralei, and to the
   Beringian M. segerstralei lineage. The lack of reciprocal monophyly of
   the two species in respect to their mitochondrial genealogy could
   indicate postspeciation mitochondrial introgression, also exemplified by
   an evidently more recent capture of M. segerstralei mitochondria in a
   Karelian population of M. salemaai. Overall, the data suggest that the
   continental boreal M. salemaai has a relatively recent ancestry in
   arctic coastal waters, whereas two other boreal `glacial relict' Mysis
   sibling species in Europe (Mysis relicta) and North America (Mysis
   diluviana) have colonized inland waters much earlier (approximately 8\%
   COI divergence).}},

Abstract = {{The brittle-star Acrocnida brachiata (Montagu) lives in sandy-bottom
   habitat of both intertidal and subtidal zones along the coasts of the
   northwestern Europe. An allozyme frequency-based survey (five enzyme
   loci) was combined with a mitochondrial (mt) COI haplotype analysis
   (598-bp sequences) on 17 populations to trace back past colonization
   pathways from the actual population structure of the species. Both
   genetic markers display a sharp genetic break between intertidal (clade
   I) and subtidal populations (clade S). This break corresponds to an
   allele frequency inversion at three enzyme loci (Hk, Pgm and Pgi) and a
   deep divergence of about 20\% in mtCOI sequences between most of the
   intertidal populations and other samples. The geographic distribution of
   clade I seems to be more restricted than clade S as it is absent from
   the intertidal of the eastern English Channel and North Sea and may be
   replaced by clade S in south Brittany. Applying previously published
   rates of mutation, divergence between the two clades is estimated to
   pre-date 5 million years ago and may be due to allopatric speciation
   processes at the Mio-Pliocene transition. The occurrence of putative
   hybrids in a few localities, however, suggests incomplete cryptic
   speciation with secondary contact zones. The relative importance of
   colonization history vs. habitat specialization are discussed in the
   light of neutral evolution as tested from mtCOI gene sequences. While
   differential selection seems to have contributed little to the
   separation of the lineages, it may have played a role in the emergence
   of adaptive polymorphisms in the hybrid zone. Furthermore, congruent
   spatial patterns of differentiation were observed in both clades
   suggesting a recent increase in population size. These findings are in
   agreement with a recent expansion of the populations during or after the
   formation of the English Channel, from a southern refuge for the
   subtidal clade whereas the intertidal clade may have persisted further
   north. As previously suspected for a species with a very short pelagic
   larval phase, contemporary gene flow between distant or adjacent
   populations appears to be extremely reduced or even absent.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the spatial and temporal scales at which
   planktonic organisms are genetically structured. A previous study of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the holoplanktonic chaetognath Sagitta
   setosa revealed strong phylogeographic structuring suggesting that
   Northeast (NE) Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations are
   genetically disjunct. The present study used a higher sampling intensity
   and a combination of mitochondrial and four microsatellite markers to
   reveal population structuring between and within basins. Between basins,
   both marker sets indicated significant differentiation confirming
   earlier results that gene flow is probably absent between the respective
   S. setosa populations. At the within-basin scale, we found no evidence
   of spatial or temporal structuring within the NE Atlantic. In the
   Mediterranean basin, both marker sets indicated significant structuring,
   but only the mtDNA data indicated a sharp genetic division between
   Adriatic and all other Mediterranean populations. Data were inconclusive
   about population structuring in the Black Sea. The levels of
   differentiation indicated by the two marker sets differed substantially,
   with far less pronounced structure detected by microsatellite than mtDNA
   data. This study also uncovered the presence of highly divergent
   mitochondrial lineages that were discordant with morphology, geography
   and nuclear DNA. We thus propose the hypothesis that highly divergent
   mitochondrial lineages may be present within interbreeding S. setosa
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that members of the unisexual hybrid complex
   of the genus Ambystoma possess a mitochondrial genome that is unrelated
   to their nuclear parental species, but the origin of this mitochondrion
   has remained unclear. We used a 744-bp fragment of the mitochondrial
   gene cytochrome b within a comparative phylogenetic framework to infer
   the maternal ancestor of this unisexual lineage. By examining a broader
   range of species than has previously been compared, we were able to
   uncover a recent maternal ancestor to this complex. Unexpectedly,
   Ambystoma barbouri, a species whose nuclear DNA has not been identified
   in the unisexuals, was found to be the recent maternal ancestor of the
   individuals examined through the discovery of a shared mtDNA haplotype
   between the unisexuals and A. barbouri. Based on a combination of
   sequence data and glacial patterning, we estimate that the unisexual
   lineage probably originated less than 25 000 years ago. In addition, all
   unisexuals examined showed extremely similar mtDNA sequences and the
   resultant phylogeny was consistent with a single origin for this
   lineage. These results confirm previous suggestions that the unisexual
   Ambystoma complex was formed from a hybridization event in which the
   nuclear DNA of the original maternal species was subsequently lost.}},

Abstract = {{During Pleistocene, the Laurentide ice sheet rearranged and diversified
   biotic distributions in eastern North America, yet had minimal physical
   impact in western North America where lineage diversification is instead
   hypothesized to result from climatic changes. If Pleistocene climatic
   fluctuations impacted desert species, the latter would reflect patterns
   of restricted gene flow concomitant with indications of demographic
   bottlenecks. Accordingly, molecular evidence for refugia should be
   present within these distributions and for subsequent range expansions
   as conditions improved. We sought answers to these questions by
   evaluating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from four species of
   rattlesnakes {[}Crotalus mitchellii (speckled rattlesnake), Crotalus
   cerastes (sidewinder), Crotalus tigris (tiger rattlesnake), Crotalus
   ruber (red diamond rattlesnake)] with distributions restricted to desert
   regions of southwestern North America. We inferred relationships using
   parsimony and maximum likelihood, tested intraspecific clades for
   population expansions, applied an isolation-with-migration model to
   determine bi-directional migration rates (m) among regions, and inferred
   divergence times for species and clades by applying a semiparametric
   penalized likelihood approach to our molecular data. Evidence for
   significant range expansion was present in two of eight regions in two
   species (Crotalus mitchellii pyrrhus, C. tigris region north). Two
   species (C. cerastes, C. mitchellii) showed a distribution concomitant
   with northward displacement of Baja California from mainland Mexico,
   followed by vicariant separation into subclades. Effects of Pleistocene
   climate fluctuations were found in the distributions of all four
   species. Three regional diversification patterns were identified: (i)
   shallow genetic diversity that resulted from Pleistocene climatic events
   (C. tigris, C. ruber); (ii) deep Pleistocene divisions indicating
   allopatric segregation of subclades within refugia (C. mitchellii, C.
   cerastes); and (iii) lineage diversifications that extended to Pliocene
   or Late Miocene (C. mitchellii, C. cerastes). Clade-diversifying and
   clade-constraining effects impacted the four species of rattlesnakes
   unequally. We found relatively high levels of molecular diversification
   in the two most broadly distributed species (C. mitchellii, C.
   cerastes), and lower levels of genetic diversification in the two
   species (C. tigris, C. ruber) whose ranges are relatively more
   restricted. Furthermore, in several cases, the distributions of
   subspecies were not congruent with our molecular information. We suggest
   regional conservation perspectives for southwestern deserts cannot rely
   upon subspecies as biodiversity surrogates, but must instead employ a
   molecular and deep historical perspective as a primary mechanism to
   frame biodiversity reserves within this region.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, southern peninsulas served as refugia during cold periods in
   the Pleistocene, acting both as centres of origin of endemisms and as
   sources from which formerly glaciated areas were recolonized during
   interglacial periods. Previous studies have revealed that within the
   main refugial areas, intraspecific lineages often survived in allopatric
   refugia. We analysed two mitochondrial markers (nad4, control region,
   similar to 1.4 kb) in 103 individuals representing the entire
   distribution of Lissotriton boscai, a newt endemic to the western
   Iberian Peninsula. We inferred the evolutionary history of the species
   through phylogenetic, phylogeographic and historical demographic
   analyses. The results revealed unexpected, deep levels of geographically
   structured genetic variability. We identified two main evolutionary
   lineages, each containing three well-supported clades. The first
   historical split involved populations from central-southwestern coastal
   Portugal and the ancestor of all the remaining populations around 5.8
   million years ago. Both lineages were subsequently fragmented into
   different population groups between 2.5 and 1.2 million years ago.
   According to nested clade analysis, at lower hierarchical levels the
   patterns suggest restricted gene flow with isolation by distance,
   whereas at higher levels the clades exhibit signatures of contiguous
   range expansion. Bayesian Skyline Plots show recent bottlenecks,
   followed by demographic expansions in all lineages. The significant
   genetic structure found is consistent with long-term survival of
   populations in allopatric refugia, supporting the
   `refugia-within-refugia' scenario for southern European peninsulas. The
   comparison of our results with other co-distributed species highlights
   the generality of this hypothesis for the Iberian herpetofauna and
   suggests that Mediterranean refuges had more relevance for the
   composition and distribution of present biodiversity patterns than
   currently acknowledged. We briefly discuss the taxonomic and
   conservation implications of our results.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic patterns of parthenogenesis and the number of transitions
   from sexual diploidy to asexual (apomictic) autopolyploidy were examined
   for 40 populations of the Easter daisy, Townsendia hookeri. Analyses of
   pollen diameter and stainability characterized 15 sexual diploid and 25
   apomictic polyploid populations from throughout the plant's western
   North American range. Sexual diploids were restricted to two Wisconsin
   refugia: Colorado/Wyoming, south of the ice sheets, and northern
   Yukon/Beringia. Chloroplast DNA sequencing uncovered 17 polymorphisms
   within the ndhF gene and trnK intron, yielding 10 haplotypes.
   Phylogenetic analyses indicated that five exclusively polyploid
   haplotypes were derived from four haplotypes that are shared among
   ploidies, conservatively inferring a minimum of four origins of
   apomictic polyploidy. Three of these apomictic polyploid origins were
   derived from southern sexual diploids, while the fourth origin was
   derived from northern sexual diploids. Analyses of regional diversity
   were suggestive of a formerly broad distribution for sexual diploids
   that has become subsequently fragmented, possibly due to the last round
   of glaciation. As sexual diploids were exclusively found north and south
   of the glacial maximum, while formerly glaciated areas were exclusively
   inhabited by asexual polyploids derived from both northern and southern
   sexual lineages, it is more likely that patterns of glaciation, as
   opposed to a particular latitudinal trend, played a causal role in the
   establishment of the observed pattern of geographic parthenogenesis in
   Easter daisies.}},

Abstract = {{Isolation of populations at the margins of a species range may lead to
   decreasing genetic diversity via genetic drift and inbreeding.
   Hybridization between peripheral populations of two species can,
   however, counteract genetic impoverishment. The mainly clonal, polyploid
   plant Saxifraga cernua has a wide arctic distribution but also extends
   southwards into alpine sites. In the Ural Mountains, its peripheral
   distribution overlaps with that of its sexually reproducing, diploid
   relative Saxifraga sibirica, and fertile polyploids of more or less
   intermediate appearance are found in this overlap zone. We used
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to address the
   potential impact of interspecific gene flow on genetic diversity in the
   peripheral populations. A total of 149 plants from 17 populations along
   a 1650 km south-north gradient were analysed for 253 markers. The
   results suggest that three Middle Ural populations containing fertile
   and morphologically more or less intermediate plants have been affected
   by hybridization. All of these plants formed a strongly supported
   (100\%) group with S. cernua in a neighbour-joining tree, but their AFLP
   phenotypes assigned either to S. cernua or to artificial (simulated) F-1
   hybrids between S. cernua and S. sibirica in multilocus assignment
   tests. The three populations were highly diverse with virtually every
   plant representing a distinct AFLP phenotype, providing additional
   evidence for formation of later-generation hybrids and/or backcrossing
   to S. cernua. In contrast, other peripheral populations of S. cernua
   were typically monoclonal, suggesting that hybridization with S.
   sibirica can increase genetic diversity in S. cernua at its southern
   periphery.}},

Abstract = {{The taxonomic status of populations of rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes
   chrysocome) is still enigmatic. Northern populations differ from
   southern ones in breeding phenology, song characteristics and head
   ornaments used as mating signals. We conducted a molecular analysis
   using mitochondrial DNA sequencing to test if there is a gene flow
   barrier between northern (subtropical) populations and southern
   (subantarctic) populations in relation to the Subtropical Convergence, a
   major ecological boundary for marine organisms. Sequences of the control
   region and the ND2 gene were analysed in rockhopper penguins and in the
   macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), a closely related species.
   Genetic distances and phylogenetic analyses showed a clear split into
   three clades, two rockhopper clades and the macaroni penguin. Moreover,
   Theta(ST) and gene flow estimates also suggested genetic structuring
   within the northern rockhoppers. Our results add further support to the
   notion that the two rockhopper penguin taxa, often considered as two
   subspecies, can be recognized as two species E. chrysocome and E.
   moseleyi. The divergence in mating signals found between these two taxa
   seems to have occurred recently and relatively rapidly. Thus, the
   behavioural changes may have been enough to isolate these taxa without
   the need for morphological differentiation. The findings have important
   conservational implications, since E. moseleyi is far less abundant than
   E. chrysocome, but more populations may warrant an uplisting to
   endangered status if full species status should be recognized for more
   subpopulations.}},

Abstract = {{In order to contribute to the debate about southern glacial refugia used
   by temperate species and more northern refugia used by boreal or
   cold-temperate species, we examined the phylogeography of a widespread
   snake species (Vipera berus) inhabiting Europe up to the Arctic Circle.
   The analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation in 1043
   bp of the cytochrome b gene and in 918 bp of the noncoding control
   region was performed with phylogenetic approaches. Our results suggest
   that both the duplicated control region and cytochrome b evolve at a
   similar rate in this species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that V. berus
   is divided into three major mitochondrial lineages, probably resulting
   from an Italian, a Balkan and a Northern (from France to Russia)
   refugial area in Eastern Europe, near the Carpathian Mountains. In
   addition, the Northern clade presents an important substructure,
   suggesting two sequential colonization events in Europe. First, the
   continent was colonized from the three main refugial areas mentioned
   above during the Lower-Mid Pleistocene. Second, recolonization of most
   of Europe most likely originated from several refugia located outside of
   the Mediterranean peninsulas (Carpathian region, east of the
   Carpathians, France and possibly Hungary) during the Mid-Late
   Pleistocene, while populations within the Italian and Balkan Peninsulas
   fluctuated only slightly in distribution range, with larger lowland
   populations during glacial times and with refugial mountain populations
   during interglacials, as in the present time. The phylogeographical
   structure revealed in our study suggests complex recolonization dynamics
   of the European continent by V. berus, characterized by latitudinal as
   well as altitudinal range shifts, driven by both climatic changes and
   competition with related species.}},

Abstract = {{Mating in the marsupial genus Antechinus is a synchronous annual event
   that is characterized by monoestry in females and abrupt postmating
   mortality in males. Male semelparity (multiple copulations during a
   single breeding season per lifetime) is often assumed to occur as a
   consequence of the intense mating effort expended by males in the rut,
   but the forces selecting for this remain elusive. Here, we investigate
   selection in male brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii, and test two
   hypotheses for the evolution of semelparity: intermale competition and
   sperm competition. If intermale competition drives semelparity, we
   predicted that males would be under strong selection for large body
   size. If sperm competition is important, we predicted that selection
   would be strongest on scrotal size, a surrogate for testes volume. Using
   microsatellite markers, we found that 92\% of females in free-living
   conditions mated with multiple males, producing litters of eight that
   had up to four fathers. These observations confirm the potential for
   sperm competition. Using selection analysis, we then found paternity
   success in 119 males to be related most strongly to body mass and
   scrotal size, thus providing support for both hypotheses. Large males
   presumably experience increased paternity success by gaining more
   matings or prolonged copulations via mate guarding, while large testes
   may allow increased sperm investment per copulation. Increased levels of
   free corticosteroid hormones in males facilitate the extreme mating
   effort during the short period of rut, but lead to immune suppression
   and consequently to the phenomenon of postmating mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a fundamental process influencing evolution, social
   behaviour, and the long-term persistence of populations. We use both
   observational and genetic data to investigate dispersal, kin-clustering
   and intergroup relatedness in the white-breasted thrasher, Ramphocinclus
   brachyurus, a cooperatively breeding bird that is globally endangered.
   Mark-resighting data suggested sex-biased dispersal, with females
   dispersing over greater distances while males remained philopatric.
   Accordingly, spatial autocorrelation analysis showed highly significant
   fine-scale genetic structure among males, but not among females. This
   fine-scale genetic structuring of the male population resulted in very
   high levels of relatedness between dominant males at neighbouring nests,
   similar to that seen within cooperative groups in many species where kin
   selection is cited as a cause of cooperation. By implication,
   between-group as well as within-group cooperation may be important,
   potentially creating a feedback loop in which short-distance dispersal
   by males leads to the formation of male kin clusters that in turn
   facilitate nepotistic interactions and favour further local recruitment.
   The strength of spatial autocorrelation, as measured by the
   autocorrelation coefficient, r, was approximately two to three times
   greater than that reported in previous studies of animals. Relatively
   short dispersal distances by both males and females may have a negative
   impact on the white-breasted thrasher's ability to colonize new areas,
   and may influence the long-term persistence of isolated populations.
   This should be taken into account when designating protected areas or
   selecting sites for habitat restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Dawson's burrowing bee is a large solitary ground-nesting bee endemic to
   the arid zone of Western Australia. In this study, we use microsatellite
   markers to analyse the genotypes of offspring from individual nests to
   determine the number of effective mates for each female. From these data
   we have determined that females almost certainly mate only once which is
   consistent with male reproductive tactics that include protandry and
   intense male-male competition for access to virgin females. We also use
   the molecular data to show that the nesting female is the mother of all
   the offspring of her nest and that brood parasitism is unlikely in this
   species. The data indicate that females make daughters at the beginning
   of the season followed by large sons in the middle, and then small sons
   at the end. Females often place one brood cell directly above another.
   The distribution of sex and morph in these doublets follows a pattern
   with most containing a female on the bottom and a minor male on the top,
   followed by almost equal numbers of female on top of female and minor
   male on top of major male. This pattern is likely favoured by emergence
   patterns, with males emerging before females and minor males emerging
   before major males. We suggest that although minor males have low
   reproductive success, their production may nonetheless be beneficial in
   that minor males open up emergence tunnels for their larger and
   reproductively more valuable siblings. In addition, minor males may be a
   best of a bad job product arising from changes in the costs to nesting
   females of gathering brood provisions over the course of the flight
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid increases in global temperature are likely to impose strong
   directional selection on many plant populations, which must therefore
   adapt if they are to survive. Within populations, microgeographic
   genetic differentiation of individuals with respect to climate suggests
   that some populations may adapt to changing temperatures in the
   short-term through rapid changes in gene frequency. We used a genome
   scan to identify temperature-related adaptive differentiation of
   individuals of the tree species Fagus sylvatica. By combining molecular
   marker and dendrochronological data we assessed spatial and temporal
   variation in gene frequency at the locus identified as being under
   selection. We show that gene frequency at this locus varies predictably
   with temperature. The probability of the presence of the dominant marker
   allele shows a declining trend over the latter half of the 20th century,
   in parallel with rising temperatures in the region. Our results show
   that F. sylvatica populations may show some capacity for an in situ
   adaptive response to climate change. However as reported ongoing
   distributional changes demonstrate, this response is not enough to allow
   all populations of this species to persist in all of their current
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{Phytochromes are photoreceptors that provide plants with circadian,
   seasonal, and positional information critical for the control of
   germination, seedling development, shade avoidance, reproduction,
   dormancy, and sleep movements. Phytochromes are unique among
   photoreceptors in their capacity to interconvert between a red-absorbing
   form (absorption maximum of similar to 660 nm) and a far-red absorbing
   form (absorption maximum of similar to 730 nm), which occur in a dynamic
   equilibrium within plant cells, corresponding to the proportions of red
   and far-red energy in ambient light. Because pigments in stems and
   leaves absorb wavelengths below about 700 nm, this provides plants with
   an elegant system for detecting their position relative to other plants,
   with which the plants compete for light. Certain aspects of
   phytochrome-mediated development outside of flowering plants are
   strikingly similar to those that have been characterized in Arabidopsis
   thaliana and other angiosperms. However, early diverging land plants
   have fewer distinct phytochrome gene lineages, suggesting that both
   diversification and subfunctionalization have been important in the
   evolution of the phytochrome gene family. There is evidence that
   subfunctionalization proceeded by the partitioning among paralogues of
   photosensory specificity, physiological response modes, and
   light-regulated gene expression and protein stability. Parallel events
   of duplication and functional divergence may have coincided with the
   evolution of canopy shade and the increasing complexity of the light
   environment. Within angiosperms, patterns of functional divergence are
   clade-specific and the roles of phytochromes in A. thaliana change
   across environments, attesting to the evolutionary flexibility and
   contemporaneous plasticity of phytochrome signalling in the control of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic composition and mating systems of edge
   populations provides important insights into the environmental and
   demographic factors shaping species' distribution ranges. We analysed
   samples of the mangrove Avicennia marina from Vietnam, northern
   Philippines and Australia, with microsatellite markers. We compared
   genetic diversity and structure in edge (Southeast Asia, and Southern
   Australia) and core (North and Eastern Australia) populations, and also
   compared our results with previously published data from core and
   southern edge populations. Comparisons highlighted significantly reduced
   gene diversity and higher genetic structure in both margins compared to
   core populations, which can be attributed to very low effective
   population size, pollinator scarcity and high environmental pressure at
   distribution margins. The estimated level of inbreeding was
   significantly higher in northeastern populations compared to core and
   southern populations. This suggests that despite the high genetic load
   usually associated with inbreeding, inbreeding or even selfing may be
   advantageous in margin habitats due to the possible advantages of
   reproductive assurance, or local adaptation. The very high level of
   genetic structure and inbreeding show that populations of A. marina are
   functioning as independent evolutionary units more than as components of
   a metapopulation system connected by gene flow. The combinations of
   those characteristics make these peripheral populations likely to
   develop local adaptations and therefore to be of particular interest for
   conservation strategies as well as for adaptation to possible future
   environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Although F-ST values are widely used to elucidate population
   relationships, in some cases, when employing highly polymorphic loci,
   they should be regarded with caution, particularly when subspecies are
   under consideration. Tripterygion delaisi presents two subspecies that
   were investigated here, using 10 microsatellite loci. A Bayesian
   approach allowed us to clearly identify both subspecies as two different
   evolutionary significant units. However, low F-ST values were found
   between subspecies as a consequence of the large number of alleles per
   locus, while homoplasy could be disregarded as indicated by the
   standardized genetic distance G'(ST). Heterozygosity saturation was
   observed in highly polymorphic loci containing more than 15 alleles, and
   this threshold was used to define two loci pools. The less variable loci
   pool revealed higher genetic variance between subspecies, while the more
   variable pool showed higher genetic variance between populations.
   Furthermore, higher differentiation was also observed between
   populations using G'(ST) with the more variable loci. Nonetheless, a
   more reliable population structure within subspecies was obtained when
   all loci were included in the analyses. In T.d. xanthosoma, isolation by
   distance was detected between the eight analysed populations, and six
   genetically homogeneous clusters were inferred by Bayesian analyses that
   are in accordance with F-ST values. The neighbourhood-size method also
   indicated rather small dispersal capabilities. In conclusion, in fish
   with limited adult and larval dispersal capabilities, continuous rocky
   habitat seems to allow contact between populations and prevent genetic
   differentiation, while large discontinuities of sand or deep-water
   channels seems to reduce gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that many plant-feeding insects are pests, little
   effort has been made to identify key evolutionary trait transitions that
   allow taxa to acquire or lose pest status. A large proportion of species
   in the genus Callosobruchus are economically important pests of stored,
   dry postharvest beans of the tribe Phaseoleae. However, the evolution of
   this feeding habit is poorly understood. Here, we present a
   reconstruction of the phylogeny of the Asian and African Callosobruchus
   based on three mitochondrial genes, and assess which traits have been
   associated with the evolutionary origin or loss of ability to reproduce
   on dry beans. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that species group into
   the chinensis and the maculatus clades, which are also supported by
   genital morphology, and an additional paraphyletic group. Ancestral
   ability to use dry beans has been lost in the chinensis clade but
   acquired again in C. chinensis. Dry-bean use and host-plant use were
   both phylogenetically constrained and transitions in the two were
   significantly correlated. Host shifts from the subtribe Phaseolinae to
   Cajaninae were more common than the reverse and were more likely in
   species using young beans. The ability to use dry beans was more likely
   gained when using Phaseolinae hosts and promoted habitat shifts from
   tropical to temperate regions. Adaptation to arid climate was also
   associated with the ability to reproduce on dry beans and on
   Phaseolinae. Thus, our analysis suggests that physiological adaptations
   to an arid climate and to Phaseolinae hosts both render beetles
   predisposed to become pests of cultivated beans.}},

Abstract = {{Using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, we assessed the
   phylogeographic structure of Prosimulium neomacropyga, a black fly
   (Simuliidae) whose distribution in the US Southern Rockies ecoregion is
   limited to alpine tundra streams. Given high habitat specificity, lack
   of hydrological connection between streams, and a terrestrial
   environment restrictive to insect flight, we hypothesized limited gene
   flow. A spatially nested sampling design showed that grouping
   populations according to high-elevation `islands' of alpine tundra
   (which typically include headwater streams of > 1 watershed) explained a
   significant proportion of genetic variation while grouping streams
   according to major watershed (across islands) did not. Nested clade
   analysis and isolation-by-distance (IBD) relationships further
   implicated limited ongoing gene flow within but not among the isolated
   alpine islands. IBD was strong among five streams within an individual
   island using each of four alternative models of pairwise landscape
   connectivity for flying insects. Results of all landscape models were
   positively correlated, suggesting that straight-line distance is an
   acceptable surrogate for presumably more biologically meaningful
   connectivity measures in this system. IBD was significantly weaker
   across the entire study area, comprised of three separate islands.
   Overall, population structure was significant with F-ST = 0.38,
   suggesting limited dispersal across a small spatial extent.}},

Abstract = {{The obligate mutualisms between flowering plants and their
   seed-parasitic pollinators constitute fascinating examples of
   interspecific mutualisms, which are often characterized by high levels
   of species diversity and reciprocal species specificity. The
   diversification in these mutualisms has been thought to occur through
   simultaneous speciation of the partners, mediated by tight reciprocal
   adaptation; however, recent studies cast doubt over this general view.
   In this study, we examine the diversity and species specificity of
   Epicephala moths (Gracillariidae) that pollinate Glochidion trees
   (Phyllanthaceae), using analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear gene
   sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of Epicephala moths associated with
   five Glochidion species in Japan and Taiwan reveal six genetically
   isolated species that are also distinguishable by male genital
   morphology: (i) two species specific to single host species (G.
   acuminatum and G. zeylanicum, respectively); (ii) two species that
   coexist on G. lanceolatum; and (iii) two species that share two,
   closely-related parapatric hosts (G. obovatum and G. rubrum).
   Statistical analysis shows that the two species associated with G.
   lanceolatum are not sister species, indicating the colonization of novel
   Glochidion host in at least one lineage. Behavioural observations
   suggest that all six species possess the actively-pollinating habit,
   thus none of the studied species has become a nonmutualistic `cheater'
   that exploits the benefit resulting from pollination by other species.
   Our results parallel recent findings in ecologically similar
   associations, namely the fig-fig wasp and yucca-yucca moth mutualisms,
   and contribute to a more general understanding of the factors that
   determine ecological and evolutionary outcomes in these mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{The burbot, Lota lota, is the only freshwater species of the codfish
   family and has a Holarctic distribution. Pleistocene glaciations caused
   significant geographical differentiation in the past, but its life
   history characterized by winter spawning migrations over large distances
   is likely to homogenize populations by contemporary gene flow. We
   investigated the population genetic structure of 541 burbots from Lake
   Constance and adjacent Rhine and Danube tributaries in Europe using the
   entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 11 microsatellites.
   Microsatellites revealed considerable population divergence (F(ST) =
   0.26) and evidenced recent bottlenecks in two Central European rivers.
   In accordance to previous evidence two main phylogeographic lineages
   (Atlantic and Danubian) were found co-occurring at similar frequencies
   in Lake Constance, where they currently undergo random mating as
   indicated by microsatellites. The Danubian lineage contributed only a
   small proportion to the lake's mtDNA diversity, and probably expanded
   within the lake shortly after its formation similar to 10 000-15 000 BP.
   The larger Atlantic haplotype diversity suggested a population expansion
   older than the lake itself. Levels of admixture at microsatellite loci
   were less obvious due to their high variability, and coalescence methods
   were used to estimate past admixture proportions. Our results reinforce
   a model of a two-step colonization of Europe by burbot from an ancestral
   Danubian refuge, and confirm the persistence of a secondary Atlantic
   refuge, as proposed to exist for other freshwater fish. We conclude that
   the present-day burbot population in Lake Constance bears the genetic
   signature of both contemporary gene flow and historical separation
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation and loss of natural habitats are recognized as major
   threats to contemporary flora and fauna. Detecting past or current
   reductions in population size is therefore a major aim in conservation
   genetics. Statistical methods developed to this purpose have tended to
   ignore the effects of spatial population structure. However in many
   species, individual dispersal is restricted in space and fine-scale
   spatial structure such as isolation by distance (IBD) is commonly
   observed in continuous populations. Using a simulation-based approach,
   we investigated how comparative and single-point methods, traditionally
   used in a Wright-Fisher (WF) population context for detecting population
   size reduction, behave for IBD populations. We found that a complex
   `quartet' of factors was acting that includes restricted dispersal,
   population size (i.e. habitat size), demographic history, and sampling
   scale. After habitat reduction, IBD populations were characterized by a
   stronger inertia in the loss of genetic diversity than WF populations.
   This inertia increases with the strength of IBD, and decreases when the
   sampling scale increases. Depending on the method used to detect a
   population size reduction, a local sampling can be more informative than
   a sample scaled to habitat size or vice versa. However, IBD structure
   led in numerous cases to incorrect inferences on population demographic
   history. The reanalysis of a real microsatellite data set of skink
   populations from fragmented and intact rainforest habitats confirmed
   most of our simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the change of spatial genetic structure (SGS) of
   reproductive individuals over time in an expanding Pinus halepensis
   population. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to
   analyse the temporal component of SGS by following the dynamics of
   successive cohorts of the same population over time, rather than
   analysing different age cohorts at a single time. SGS is influenced by
   various factors including restricted gene dispersal, microenvironmental
   selection, mating patterns and the spatial pattern of reproductive
   individuals. Several factors that affect SGS are expected to vary over
   time and as adult density increases. Using air photo analysis, tree-ring
   dating and molecular marker analysis we reconstructed the spread of
   reproductive individuals over 30 years beginning from five initial
   individuals. In the early stages, genotypes were distributed randomly in
   space. Over time and with increasing density, fine-scale (< 20 m) SGS
   developed and the magnitude of genetic clustering increased. The SGS was
   strongly affected by the initial spatial distribution and genetic
   variation of the founding individuals. The development of SGS may be
   explained by fine-scale environmental heterogeneity and possibly
   microenvironmental selection. Inbreeding and variation in reproductive
   success may have enhanced SGS magnitude over time.}},

Abstract = {{Several processes have been described that could explain geographical
   variation and speciation within small islands, including fragmentation
   of populations through volcanic eruptions. Massive landslides, or debris
   avalanches, could cause similar effects. Here we analyse the potential
   impact of the 0.8 million-year-ago (Ma) Guimar valley debris avalanche
   on the phylogeography of the lizard Gallotia galloti on the Canary
   Island of Tenerife. Distributions of mitochondrial DNA lineages (based
   on cytochrome b sequences) were analysed on a 60-km southeastern coast
   transect centred on this area. Three main clades were detected, which
   can be divided into northern (one clade) and southern (two clades)
   groups that introgress across the valley. Maximum-likelihood estimates
   of migration rates (scaled for mutation rate) revealed highly asymmetric
   patterns, indicating that long-term gene flow into this region from both
   the northern and the southern populations greatly exceeded that in the
   opposite directions, consistent with recolonization of the area. The
   ancestral Tenerife node on the G. galloti tree is estimated at 0.80 Ma,
   matching closely with the geological estimate for the debris avalanche.
   Morphological variation (body dimensions and scalation) was also
   analysed and indicated a stepped cline in female scalation across the
   valley, although the patterns for male scalation and male and female
   body dimensions were not as clear. Together these findings provide
   support for the hypothesis that the debris avalanche has shaped the
   phylogeography of G. galloti and may even have been a primary cause of
   the within-island cladogenesis through population fragmentation and
   isolation. Current estimates of timing of island unification mean that
   the original hypothesis that within-island diversity is explained by the
   secondary contact of populations from the two ancient precursor islands
   of Teno and Anaga is less plausible for this and some other Tenerife
   species. Large-scale landslides have occurred on many volcanic islands,
   and so may have been instrumental in shaping within-island diversities.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions may combine the genetic effects of population
   bottlenecks and selection and thus provide valuable insight into the
   role of such processes during novel environmental colonizations.
   However, these processes are also influenced by multiple invasions, the
   number of individuals introduced and the degree of similarity between
   source and receiving habitats. The amphipod Gammarus tigrinus provides a
   useful model to assess these factors, as its invasion history has
   involved major environmental transitions. This species is native to the
   northwest Atlantic Ocean, although it invaded both brackish and
   freshwater habitats in the British Isles after introduction more than 65
   years ago. It has also spread to similar habitats in Western Europe and,
   most recently, to Eastern Europe, the Baltic Sea, and the Laurentian
   Great Lakes. To examine sources of invasion and patterns of genetic
   change, we sampled populations from 13 native estuaries and 19 invaded
   sites and sequenced 542 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene. Strong native
   phylogeographical structure allowed us to unambiguously identify three
   allopatrically evolved clades (2.3-3.1\% divergent) in invading
   populations, indicative of multiple introductions. The most divergent
   clades occurred in the British Isles and mainland Europe and were
   sourced from the St Lawrence and Chesapeake/Delaware Bay estuaries. A
   third clade was found in the Great Lakes and sourced to the Hudson River
   estuary. Despite extensive sampling, G. tigrinus did not occur in
   freshwater at putative source sites. Some European populations showed
   reduced genetic diversity consistent with bottlenecks, although
   selection effects cannot be excluded. The habitat distribution of clades
   in Europe was congruent with the known invasion history of secondary
   spread from the British Isles. Differences in salinity tolerance among
   lineages were suggested by patterns of habitat colonization by different
   native COI clades. Populations consisting of admixtures of the two
   invading clades were found principally at recently invaded fresh and
   brackish water sites in Eastern Europe, and were characterized by higher
   genetic diversity than putative source populations. Further studies are
   required to determine if these represent novel genotypes. Our results
   confirm that biological invasions need not result in diminished genetic
   diversity, particularly if multiple source populations, each with
   distinctive genetic composition, contribute to the founding populations.}},

Abstract = {{The two closely related ash species Fraxinus excelsior L. (common ash)
   and Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl (narrow-leaved ash) have a broad contact
   zone in France where they hybridize. However, little is known about the
   local structure of hybrid zone populations and the isolation mechanisms.
   We assessed the potential effect of floral phenology on the structure of
   a riparian ash hybrid zone population in central France. The
   distribution of flowering times was unimodal and lay between the
   flowering periods of the two species. Using microsatellite markers, we
   detected isolation by time, which has possibly originated from
   assortative mating. Multivariate analyses indicated that morphological
   variation is not distributed at random with respect to flowering times.
   Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that temporal and spatial
   patterns were tightly linked. Interestingly, despite the fact that the
   population shows isolation by time, neighbourhood size and historical
   dispersal variance (sigma = 63 m) are similar to those detected in pure
   stands of F. excelsior where individuals flower rather synchronously and
   hermaphrodites are not the most frequent sexual type. Trees flowering at
   intermediate dates, which comprised the majority of the population,
   produced on average more flowers and fruits. We detected no significant
   differences in floral parasite infections relative to reproductive
   timing, although there was a tendency for late flowering trees to suffer
   from more gall attack. We discuss the impact of temporal variation in
   fitness traits and their possible role in the maintenance of the hybrid
   zone.}},

Abstract = {{Although many coastal shark species have widespread distributions, the
   genetic relatedness of worldwide populations has been examined for few
   species. The blacktip shark, (Carcharhinus limbatus), inhabits tropical
   and subtropical coastal waters throughout the world. In this study, we
   examined the genetic relationships of blacktip shark populations (n =
   364 sharks) throughout the majority of the species' range using the
   entire mitochondrial control region (1067-1070 nucleotides). Two
   geographically distinct maternal lineages (western Atlantic, Gulf of
   Mexico, and Caribbean Sea clades, and eastern Atlantic, Indian, and
   Pacific Ocean clades) were identified and shallow population structure
   was detected throughout their geographic ranges. These findings indicate
   that a major population subdivision exists across the Atlantic Ocean,
   but not the Pacific Ocean. The historical dispersal of this widespread,
   coastal species may have been interrupted by the rise of the Isthmus of
   Panama. This scenario implies historical dispersal across the Pacific
   Ocean (supported by the recovery of the same common haplotype from the
   Philippines, Hawaii, and the Gulf of California reflecting
   recent/contemporary dispersal abilities) and an oceanic barrier to
   recent migration across the Atlantic. Genetic structure within the
   eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific (Phi(ST) = 0.612, P < 0.001) supports
   maternal philopatry throughout this area, expanding previous western
   Atlantic findings. Eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific C. limbatus control
   region haplotypes were paraphyletic to Carcharhinus tilstoni haplotypes
   in our maximum-parsimony analysis. The greater divergence of western
   Atlantic C. limbatus than C. tilstoni from eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific
   C. limbatus reflects the taxonomic uncertainty of western Atlantic C.

Abstract = {{Human-induced changes to natural systems can cause major disturbances to
   fundamental ecological and population processes and result in local
   extinctions and secondary contacts between formerly isolated species.
   Extensive fur seal harvesting during the nineteenth century on Macquarie
   Island (subantarctic) resulted in extinction of the original population.
   Recolonization by three species has been slow and complex, characterized
   by the establishment of breeding groups of Antarctic and subantarctic
   fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis) and
   presumed nonbreeding (itinerant) male New Zealand fur seals
   (Arctocephalus forsteri). One thousand and seven pups from eight annual
   cohorts (1992-2003) were analysed using mitochondrial control region
   data (RFLP) and 10 microsatellite loci to estimate species composition
   and hybridization. Antarctic fur seals predominated, but hybridization
   occurred between all three species (17-30\% of all pups). Involvement of
   New Zealand fur seals was unexpected as females are absent and males are
   not observed to hold territories during the breeding season. The
   proportion of hybrids in the population has fallen over time, apparently
   owing to substantial influxes of pure Antarctic and subantarctic
   individuals and non-random mating. Over 50\% of New Zealand hybrids and
   43\% of Antarctic-subantarctic hybrids were not F-1, which indicates
   some degree of hybrid reproductive success, and this may be
   underestimated: simulations showed that hybrids become virtually
   undetectable by the third generation of backcrossing. While human
   impacts seem to have driven novel hybridization in this population, the
   present `time slices' analysis suggests some biological resistance to
   complete homogenization.}},

Abstract = {{The phylogeography of thornback rays (Raja clavata) was assessed from
   European waters, using five nuclear microsatellite loci and
   mitochondrial cytochome b sequences. Strong regional differentiation was
   found between the Mediterranean basin, the Azores and the European
   continental shelf. Allelic and haplotype diversities were high in
   Portuguese populations, consistent with the existence of a refugium
   along the Iberian Peninsula. Unexpectedly, high diversity was also found
   in the English Channel/North Sea area. The lowest genetic diversity was
   found in the Black Sea. Populations sampled from the Mediterranean,
   Adriatic and Black Seas were characterized by a single mitochondrial
   haplotype. This haplotype was also the most ancestral and widespread
   outside of the Mediterranean basin except for the Azores. Populations
   from the Azores were dominated by a second ancestral haplotype which was
   shared with British populations. Results from multidimensional scaling,
   amova and nested clade analysis indicate that British waters are a
   secondary contact zone recolonized from at least two refugia - one
   around the Iberian Peninsula and one possibly in the Azores. Links to a
   potential refugium known as the Hurd Deep, between Cornwall and
   Brittany, are discussed. Finally, a historical demographic analysis
   indicates that thornback ray populations started to expand between 580
   000 and 362 000 years ago, which suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum
   (20 000 years ago) had mainly affected the distribution of populations
   rather than population size.}},

Abstract = {{The domestication of the Eurasian grape (Vitis vinifera ssp. sativa)
   from its wild ancestor (Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris) has long been
   claimed to have occurred in Transcaucasia where its greatest genetic
   diversity is found and where very early archaeological evidence,
   including grape pips and artefacts of a `wine culture', have been
   excavated. Whether from Transcaucasia or the nearby Taurus or Zagros
   Mountains, it is hypothesized that this wine culture spread southwards
   and eventually westwards around the Mediterranean basin, together with
   the transplantation of cultivated grape cuttings. However, the existence
   of morphological differentiation between cultivars from eastern and
   western ends of the modern distribution of the Eurasian grape suggests
   the existence of different genetic contribution from local sylvestris
   populations or multilocal selection and domestication of sylvestris
   genotypes. To tackle this issue, we analysed chlorotype variation and
   distribution in 1201 samples of sylvestris and sativa genotypes from the
   whole area of the species' distribution and studied their genetic
   relationships. The results suggest the existence of at least two
   important origins for the cultivated germplasm, one in the Near East and
   another in the western Mediterranean region, the latter of which gave
   rise to many of the current Western European cultivars. Indeed, over
   70\% of the Iberian Peninsula cultivars display chlorotypes that are
   only compatible with their having derived from western sylvestris
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Inferring the parentage of a sample of individuals is often a
   prerequisite for many types of analysis in molecular ecology,
   evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics. In all but a few cases,
   the method of parentage assignment is divorced from the methods used to
   estimate the parameters of primary interest, such as mate choice or
   heritability. Here we present a Bayesian approach that simultaneously
   estimates the parentage of a sample of individuals and a wide range of
   population-level parameters in which we are interested. We show that
   joint estimation of parentage and population-level parameters increases
   the power of parentage assignment, reduces bias in parameter estimation,
   and accurately evaluates uncertainty in both. We illustrate the method
   by analysing a number of simulated test data sets, and through a
   re-analysis of parentage in the Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus
   sechellensis. A combination of behavioural, spatial and genetic data are
   used in the analyses and, importantly, the method does not require
   strong prior information about the relationship between nongenetic data

Abstract = {{Molecular phylogeographic studies have revealed the genetic patterns and
   glacial-interglacial history of many plant and animal species. To infer
   the Quaternary history of alpine plants in the Japanese archipelago,
   which is poorly known, we investigated 203 individuals of Potentilla
   matsumurae and its varieties from 22 populations. We found 11 haplotypes
   based on approximately 1400 bp of two intergenetic spacers in
   chloroplast DNA (trnT-L and rpl20-rps20). The distribution of these
   haplotypes was geographically structured, which was supported by
   haplotype composition, principal component analysis, and unweighted pair
   group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), and N-ST (0.71) was
   significantly greater than G(ST) (0.68). In addition to the positive
   correlation between genetic and geographic distance (Mantel test, r =
   0.497, P < 0.001), an abrupt genetic change was detected between
   mountains in central Honshu and the Tohoku region. This genetic boundary
   was further supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), and
   high variation (54.0\%) was explained by differences on either side of
   this boundary. Moreover, haplotypes in central Honshu were thought to
   have diverged, based on an outgroup comparison. These results suggest
   that mountains in central Honshu served as refugia during the Quaternary
   climatic oscillation, although the results could not reveal the history
   of most mountains in the Tohoku region and Hokkaido. Nevertheless,
   following floristic studies, our results indicate that alpine plants in
   Japan experienced a history different from that in Europe; i.e. they
   retreated into refugia during warm periods to avoid forest development,

Abstract = {{Genetic variation was investigated in 17 populations of the Italian
   endemic Apennine yellow-bellied toad using both mitochondrial (598 bp of
   the cytochrome b gene) and nuclear (21 allozyme loci) markers.
   Populations from central Calabria (southern Italy) showed the highest
   levels of intrapopulation genetic variation, whereas samples located
   north of this region were nearly lacking in variation. This appears to
   be a typical pattern of `southern richness and northern purity', usually
   attributed to the prolonged population stability within southern refugia
   coupled with the loss of variation during postglacial northward
   expansion. However, the overall pattern of genetic variation observed
   has a strong geographical component, suggesting two Calabrian plains,
   Catanzaro and Crati-Sibari, as historical barriers to dispersal
   separating three population groups. These findings cannot be explained
   by the prolonged stability of southern populations alone, and suggest
   that the southern richness has been at least in part shaped by
   allopatric differentiation within the refugial range, followed by
   intermixing of previously differentiated lineages. From a conservation
   standpoint, Calabria is the major genetic diversity reservoir for this
   species, thus deserving particular conservation efforts. Furthermore,
   although the low intrapopulation genetic variation outside Calabria
   appears to be of clear historical origin, evidence of a current
   reduction of gene flow suggests that human disturbance has also played a
   part, particularly in the anthropogenic impacted Volturno river drainage
   basin.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic analyses using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have revealed
   many examples of apparently deep historical subdivisions ('phylogroups')
   within many vertebrates. It remains unclear whether these phylogroups
   represent independently evolving, adaptively differentiated lineages or
   groups that show little functional differentiation and, hence, will
   merge on contact. Here, we use mtDNA sequence data to evaluate the
   phylogeographic relationships between two of the northernmost
   populations of black ratsnakes (Pantherophis obsoletus complex) in
   Ontario, Canada and previously analysed populations in the United
   States. We then use population-level analyses to evaluate the level of
   adaptive divergence between previously established mtDNA phylogroups.
   Phylogenetic analyses show that southern Ontario snakes have mtDNA
   haplotypes that fall within the Central mtDNA phylogroup, as designated
   by Burbrink et al. (2000). In contrast, snakes in eastern Ontario carry
   either Central or Eastern-specific haplotypes. Within the hybrid region,
   we found highly variable frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes among isolated
   sub-populations, no association between variation in cytonuclear (mtDNA)
   and nuclear (microsatellite DNA) markers, no difference in survival or
   reproductive success among snakes with different mtDNA haplotypes, and
   no effect of mate similarity in mtDNA on female clutch size. These
   results argue that the Eastern and Central phylogroups have merged in
   this region, likely due to a lack of adaptive differentiation between
   individuals in each lineage. Hence, in these snakes, phylogeographic
   structure in mtDNA is more a reflection of historical isolation rather
   than adaptive divergence. The observed reticulation between lineages and
   lack of evidence for hybrid disgenesis also bears on the classification
   of these lineages as distinct species.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular phylogenetic hypotheses of species-rich lineages in regions
   where geological history can be reliably inferred may provide insights
   into the scale of processes driving diversification. Here we sample all
   extant or recently extinct white-eye (Zosterops) taxa of the southwest
   Indian Ocean, combined with samples from all principal continental
   lineages. Results support a high dispersal capability, with at least two
   independent continental sources for white-eyes of the region. An early
   (within 1.8 million years ago) expansion into the Indian Ocean may have
   originated either from Asia or Africa; the three resulting lineages show
   a disparate distribution consistent with considerable extinction
   following their arrival. Africa is supported as the origin of a later
   expansion into the region (within 1.2 million years ago). On two
   islands, a pair of Zosterops species derived from independent
   immigrations into the Indian Ocean co-occur or may have formerly
   co-occurred, providing strong support for their origin by double-island
   colonization rather than within-island (sympatric or microallopatric)
   speciation. On Mauritius and La Reunion, phylogenetic placement of
   sympatric white-eyes allow us to rule out a scenario in which
   independent within-island speciation occurred on both islands; one of
   the species pairs must have arisen by double colonization, while the
   other pair is likely to have arisen by the same mechanism. Long-distance
   immigration therefore appears to be responsible for much of the region's
   white-eye diversity. Independent immigrations into the region have
   resulted in lineages with mutually exclusive distributions and it seems
   likely that competition with congeneric species, rather than arrival
   frequency, may limit present-day diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Two subspecies of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), common (Kobus
   ellipsiprymnus ellipsiprymnus) and defassa (Kobus ellipsiprymnus
   defassa), are recognized based on differences in rump pattern, coat
   colour and geographical distribution. These forms are parapatrically
   distributed with an area of range overlap in East Africa, where
   phenotypically intermediate populations occur. Variation in 478 bp of
   the mitochondrial DNA control region and 14 polymorphic microsatellite
   loci were used to describe the genetic structure and phylogeographical
   pattern of the species, and to assess if the intermediate populations
   are the results of hybridization. In total, 186 individuals from 11
   localities were analysed. A high degree of genetic differentiation was
   found between subspecies, although this was most evident from the
   microsatellite data. Hybridization was suggested in the phenotypically
   and geographically intermediate Nairobi NP population in Kenya. A
   neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based on microsatellite population genetic
   distances grouped Nairobi between the common and defassa populations,
   and a Bayesian analysis clearly showed introgression. Individuals
   sampled in Samburu NP, Kenya, had a common waterbuck phenotype, but
   introgression was suggested by both markers. Although a high degree of
   maternal defassa input was indicated from the sequence data, the Samburu
   population grouped with the common waterbuck in the microsatellite
   population genetic distance tree, with high support. Analyses of linkage
   disequilibrium and maximum-likelihood estimates of genetic drift
   suggested that admixture between subspecies is a recent event. The fact
   that introgression is limited between subspecies could be caused by
   chromosomal differences, hindering gene flow between common and defassa
   waterbuck.}},

Abstract = {{Pelagic dispersal of marine organisms provides abundant opportunity for
   gene flow and presumably inhibits population genetic divergence.
   However, ephemeral, fine-scale, temporal and spatial genetic
   heterogeneity is frequently observed in settled propagules of marine
   species that otherwise exhibit broad-scale genetic homogeneity. A large
   variance in reproductive success is one explanation for this phenomenon.
   Here, genetic analyses of 16 microsatellite loci are used to examine
   temporal patterns of variation in young-of-year kelp rockfish (Sebastes
   atrovirens) recruiting to nearshore habitat in Monterey Bay, California,
   USA. Population structure of adults from central California is also
   evaluated to determine if spatial structure exists and might potentially
   contribute to recruitment patterns. Genetic homogeneity was found among
   414 young-of-year sampled throughout the entire 1998 recruitment season.
   No substantial adult population structure was found among seven
   populations spanning 800 km of coastline that includes the Point
   Conception marine biogeographic boundary. Comparison of young-of-year
   and adult samples revealed no genetic differentiation and no measurable
   reduction in genetic variation of offspring, indicating little variance
   in reproductive success and no reduction in effective population size
   for this year class. Simulation analyses determined that the data set
   was sufficiently powerful to detect both slight population structure
   among adults and a small reduction in effective number of breeders
   contributing to this year class. The findings of high gene flow and low
   genetic drift have important implications for fisheries management and
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple mating is thought to provide an opportunity for females to
   avoid the costs of genetic incompatibility by postcopulatory selection
   of compatible sperm haplotypes. Few studies have tested the genetic
   incompatibility hypothesis directly. Here we experimentally manipulated
   the compatibility of females with their mates using the gryllid cricket
   Teleogryllus oceanicus. We recorded the hatching success of eggs laid by
   females mated with two nonsibling males, two siblings, or one nonsibling
   male and one sibling. In contrast with two previous studies on crickets
   that have adopted this approach, the hatching success of eggs did not
   differ between females mated with two full siblings and females mated
   with two unrelated males, indicating that embryo viability was not a
   cost of inbreeding in this species. We assigned paternity to offspring
   produced by females mated to both a sibling and a nonsibling male using
   microsatellite markers. As in previous studies of this species, we were
   unable to detect any difference in the proportion of offspring sired by
   the 1st and the 2nd male to mate with a female when females were
   unrelated to their mates. However, in our experimental matings the
   proportion of offspring sired by the nonsibling male depended on his
   sequence position. Paternity was biased toward the nonsibling male when
   he mated first. Our data show that molecular analyses of paternity are
   essential to detect subtle mechanisms of postcopulatory sexual
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{When mammalian social groups exceed their optimal size, they often tend
   to split. In view of the potential evolutionary benefits, it should be
   more advantageous for animals to stay with kin, rather than nonkin,
   during such fission events. In the present study, the spontaneous
   fission of two social groups, R and S, of rhesus macaques living on Cayo
   Santiago, Puerto Rico, provided the opportunity to compare the kinship
   structure of the corresponding parent and daughter groups, using
   information on both maternal and paternal relatedness. In both
   instances, maternal half-siblings and pairs of animals from the same
   family were significantly more prevalent in the fission products than in
   the parent group. During the split of group R, significantly more
   paternal half-siblings stayed in the remnants of the parent group than
   joined the seceding group. Our findings are compatible with previous
   behavioural studies demonstrating that female primates bias their social
   behaviour more to maternal than to paternal kin, but that both types of
   half-siblings prefer each other more than unrelated animals. It remains
   to be clarified by future research, however, whether the observed
   co-segregation of paternal half-sibs in our study reflects active choice
   or is a by-product of the group-specific kin structures, prior to
   fission.}},

Abstract = {{Extra-pair mating is widespread in birds, but its adaptive function
   remains unclear. It is often suggested that females obtain superior
   genes for their offspring as a consequence of extra-pair mating, but the
   evidence is limited. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that
   extra-pair mating provides females with offspring that have superior
   immune responses. We found that the T-cell-mediated immune response of
   extra-pair young was stronger than that of within-pair young in common
   yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas). This paternity effect occurred when
   we compared all nestlings in the population, as well as in comparisons
   of both paternal and maternal half-siblings. Paternal half-siblings had
   a stronger immune response when they were produced with extra-pair
   females than with the male's social mate, which suggests that the
   greater immune response of extra-pair young was caused by nonadditive
   (compatible) genetic effects. However, these patterns were only
   significant in the colder of 2 years. Immune response was related
   positively to air temperature and nestlings had a stronger immune
   response in the warmer year. We suggest that such environmental
   variation could obscure the genetic benefits of extra-pair mating.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic tagging, the identification of individuals using their
   genotypes, provides a powerful tool for studying animals that are
   difficult to observe or identify using conventional techniques. However,
   despite being widely adopted by conservation biologists, the full
   potential of this approach has yet to be realized. Here we used genetic
   recapture data to quantify male site fidelity at a colony of Antarctic
   fur seals where an aerial walkway provides unprecedented access and
   individual positions are determined daily to 1 m accuracy. Because males
   are too large and aggressive to be captured and fitted with conventional
   tags, we remotely collected 770 tissue samples over eight consecutive
   seasons and used nine-locus microsatellite genotypes to reveal 306
   genetic recaptures among 464 unique individuals. Within seasons, males
   are highly site-faithful, with any movements that occur tending to take
   place before the period when females come into oestrus. Of those males
   that return to breed over successive seasons, almost half return to
   within a body length of where they were before. The discovery of such
   extreme site faithfulness has implications for the population structure
   and mating system of fur seals and potentially other colonially breeding
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystins (MCs) are toxic heptapeptides that are produced by
   filamentous cyanobacteria Planktothrix rubescens and Planktothrix
   agardhii via nonribosomal peptide synthesis. MCs share a common
   structure cyclo (-D-Alanine(1)-L-X-2- D-erythro-ss-iso-aspartic
   acid(3)-L-Z(4)-Adda(5)-D-Glutamate(6)- N-methyl-dehydroalanine(7)) where
   X-2 and Z(2) are variable L-amino acids in positions 2, 4 of the
   molecule. Part of the mcyB gene (1,451 bp) that is involved in the
   activation of the X-2 amino acid during MC synthesis was sequenced in 49
   strains containing different proportions of arginine, homotyrosine, and
   leucine in position 2 of the MC molecule. Twenty-five genotypes were
   found that consisted of eight genotype groups (A-H, comprising 2-11
   strains) and 17 unique genotypes. P. rubescens and P. agardhii partly
   consisted of the same mcyB genotypes. The occurrence of numerous
   putative recombination events that affected all of the genotypes can
   explain the conflict between taxonomy and mcyB genotype distribution.
   Genotypes B (homotyrosine and leucine in X-2) and C (arginine in X-2)
   showed higher nonsynonymous/synonymous (d(N)/d(S)) substitution ratios
   implying a relaxation of selective constraints. In contrast, other
   genotypes (arginine, leucine, homotyrosine) showed lowest d(N)/d(S)
   ratios implying purifying selection. Restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) revealed the unambiguous identification of mcyB
   genotypes, which are indicative of variable X-2 amino acids in eight
   populations of P. rubescens in the Alps (Austria, Germany, and
   Switzerland). The populations were found to differ significantly in the
   proportion of specific genotypes and the number of genotypes that
   occurred over several years. It is concluded that spatial isolation
   might favour the genetic divergence of microcystin synthesis in
   Planktothrix spp.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroplast microsatellites are becoming increasingly popular markers
   for population genetic studies in plants, but there has been little
   focus on their potential for demographic inference. In this work the
   utility of chloroplast microsatellites for the study of population
   expansions was explored. First, we investigated the power of mismatch
   distribution analysis and the F-S test with coalescent simulations of
   different demographic scenarios. We then applied these methods to
   empirical data obtained for the Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis).
   The results of the simulations showed that chloroplast microsatellites
   are sensitive to sudden population growth. The power of the F-S test and
   accuracy of demographic parameter estimates, such as the time of
   expansion, were reduced proportionally to the level of homoplasy within
   the data. The analysis of Canary Island pine chloroplast microsatellite
   data indicated population expansions for almost all sample localities.
   Demographic expansions at the island level can be explained by the
   colonization of the archipelago by the pine, while population expansions
   of different ages in different localities within an island could be the
   result of local extinctions and recolonization dynamics. Comparable
   mitochondrial DNA sequence data from a parasite of P. canariensis, the
   weevil Brachyderes rugatus, supports this scenario, suggesting a key
   role for volcanism in the evolution of pine forest communities in the
   Canary Islands.}},

Abstract = {{Anchialine habitats, landlocked bodies of mixohaline water that
   fluctuate with the tides but have no surface connection to the sea, are
   known from around the world. Many anchialine organisms have widespread
   distributions and it has been hypothesized that high levels of gene flow
   and low levels of genetic differentiation are characteristic of
   populations from these habitats. However, the generality of this
   hypothesis requires further assessment, particularly in light of the
   significant negative impact these habitats and their biota have
   experienced from anthropogenic causes. This study investigated the
   population structure and demography of an endemic Hawaiian anchialine
   species, the atyid shrimp Halocaridina rubra, using mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences. A survey of 305
   individuals from 16 populations collected on the island of Hawaii
   revealed 135 haplotypes. These haplotypes belonged to one of two
   divergent (2.7-4.9\%) lineages; notably, no haplotypes were shared
   between the two coasts of the island. Along each coast, strong
   subdivision and little to no gene flow occurs between populations
   separated by > 30 km. The population structure and demography of H.
   rubra on Hawaii are influenced by regional hydrology, geology, volcanism
   and two distinct colonization events of the island. Thus, H. rubra on
   Hawaii demonstrates that populations of endemic anchialine organisms may
   exhibit significant levels of genetic structure and restricted levels of
   gene flow over limited geographic scales. This report brings novel
   insight into the biology of anchialine organisms and has important
   implications for the future management of these habitats and their
   biota.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of
   a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium
   medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the
   genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample,
   from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species,
   within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria
   were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along
   the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and
   the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants
   influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we
   then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no
   relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for
   sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found
   evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions,
   located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a
   selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which
   includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing
   selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in
   exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the
   interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible
   conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes.
   Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci
   located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus,
   recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by
   allowing different selection patterns at different loci.}},

Abstract = {{Croton alabamensis (Euphorbiaceae s.s.) is a rare plant species known
   from several populations in Texas and Alabama that have been assigned to
   var. texensis and var. alabamensis, respectively. We performed maximum
   parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences
   from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 5.8S
   regions and chloroplast trnL-trnF regions from collections of the two
   varieties of C. alabamensis and from outgroup taxa. C. alabamensis
   emerges alone on a long branch that is sister to Croton section
   Corylocroton and the Cuban endemic genus Moacroton. Molecular clock
   analysis estimates the split of C. alabamensis from its closest
   relatives in sect. Corylocroton at 41 million years ago, whereas the
   split of the two varieties of C. alabamensis occurred sometime in the
   Quaternary. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were
   performed using two selective primer pairs on a larger sampling of
   accessions (22 from Texas, 17 from Alabama) to further discriminate
   phylogenetic structure and quantify genetic diversity. Using both
   neighbour joining and minimum evolution, the populations from the Cahaba
   and Black Warrior watersheds in Alabama form two well-separated groups,
   and in Texas, geographically distinct populations are recovered from
   Fort Hood, Balcones Canyonlands, and Pace Bend Park. Most of the
   molecular variance is accounted for by variance within populations.
   Approximately equal variance is found among populations within states
   and between states (varieties). Genetic distance between the Texas
   populations is significantly less than genetic distance between the
   Alabama populations. Both sequence and AFLP data support the same
   relationships between the varieties of C. alabamensis and their
   outgroup, while the AFLP data provide better resolution among the
   different geographical regions where C. alabamensis occurs. The
   conservation implications of these findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Population genetic theory predicts that the self-incompatible and
   perennial herb, Arabidopsis lyrata, will have a genetic structure that
   differs from the self-fertilizing, annual Arabidopsis thaliana. We
   quantified the genetic structure for eight populations of A. lyrata ssp.
   petraea in historically nonglaciated regions of central Europe. Analysis
   of 20 microsatellite loci for 344 individuals demonstrated that, in
   accordance with predictions, diploid populations had high genome-wide
   heterozygosity (H-O = 0.48; H-E = 0.52), high within-population
   diversity (83\% of total) compatible with mutation-drift equilibrium,
   and moderate differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.17). Within a
   single population, the vast majority of genetic variability (92\%) was
   found at the smallest spatial scale (< 3 m). Although there was no
   evidence of biparental inbreeding or clonal propagation at this scale
   (F-IS = 0.003), significant fine-scale spatial autocorrelation indicated
   localized gene flow presumably due to gravity dispersed seeds (Sp =
   0.018). Limited gene flow between isolated population clusters (regions)
   separated by hundreds of kilometres has given rise to an isolation by
   distance pattern of diversification, with low, but significant,
   differentiation among regions (F-ST = 0.05). The maintenance of
   geographically widespread polymorphisms and uniformly high diversity
   throughout central Europe is consistent with periglacial survival of A.
   lyrata ssp. petraea north of the Alps in steppe-tundra habitats during
   the last glacial maximum. As expected of northern and previously
   glaciated localities, A. lyrata in Iceland was genetically less diverse
   and highly differentiated from central Europe (H-E = 0.37; F-ST = 0.27).}},

Abstract = {{To demonstrate the importance of genetic data for multispecies
   conservation approaches, we examined the distribution of genetic
   variation across the range of the mountain whitefish (Prosopium
   williamsoni) at microsatellite and allozyme loci. The mountain whitefish
   is a common species that is particularly well suited for accurately
   revealing historical patterns of genetic structure and differs markedly
   from previously studied species in habitat requirements and life history
   characteristics. As such, comparing the population genetic structure of
   other native fishes to similar data from mountain whitefish could inform
   management and conservation strategies. Genetic variation for mountain
   whitefish was hierarchically distributed for both allozymes and
   microsatellites. We found evidence for a total of five major genetically
   differentiated assemblages and we observed subdivision among populations
   within assemblages that generally corresponded to major river basins. We
   observed little genetic differentiation within major river basins.
   Geographic patterns of genetic differentiation for mountain whitefish
   were concordant with other native species in several circumstances,
   providing information for the designation of conservation units that
   reflect concordant genetic differentiation of multiple species.
   Differences in genetic patterns between mountain whitefish and other
   native fishes reflect either differences in evolutionary histories of
   the species considered or differences in aspects of their ecology and
   life history. In addition, mountain whitefish populations appear to
   exchange genes over a much larger geographic scale than co-occurring
   salmonids and are likely to be affected differently by disturbances such
   as habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Chihuahua spruce (Picea chihuahuana Martinez) is a montane subtropical
   conifer endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern Mexico.
   Range-wide variation was investigated using maternally inherited
   mitochondrial (mtDNA) and paternally inherited chloroplast (cpDNA) DNA
   markers. Among the 16 mtDNA regions analysed, only two mitotypes were
   detected, while the study of six cpDNA microsatellite markers revealed
   eight different chlorotypes. The average cpDNA diversity (H = 0.415) was
   low but much higher than that for mtDNA (H = 0). The distribution of
   mitotypes revealed two clear nonoverlapping areas (G(ST) = N-ST = 1),
   one including northern populations and the second one including the
   southern and central stands, suggesting that these two regions may
   represent different ancestral populations. The cpDNA markers showed
   lower population differentiation (G(ST) = 0.362; R-ST = 0.230), implying
   that the two ancestral populations continued to exchange pollen after
   their initial geographic separation. A lack of a phylogeographic
   structure was revealed by different spatial analyses of cpDNA (G(ST) >
   R-ST; and samova), and reduced cpDNA gene flow was noted among
   populations (Nm = 0.873). Some stands deviated significantly from the
   mutation-drift equilibrium, suggesting recent bottlenecks. Altogether,
   these various trends are consistent with the hypothesis of a population
   collapse during the Holocene warming and suggest that most of the modern
   P. chihuahuana populations are now effectively isolated with their
   genetic diversity essentially modelled by genetic drift. The
   conservation efforts should focus on most southern populations and on
   the northern and central stands exhibiting high levels of genetic
   diversity. Additional mtDNA sequence analysis confirmed that P.
   martinezii (Patterson) is not conspecific with P. chihuahuana, and thus
   deserves separate conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{In natural plant populations, fine-scale spatial genetic structure can
   result from limited gene flow, selection pressures or historical events,
   but the role of each factor is in general hard to discern. One way to
   investigate the origination of spatial genetic structure within a plant
   population consists of comparing spatial genetic structure among
   different life history stages. In this study, spatial genetic structure
   of the food-deceptive orchid Orchis purpurea was determined across life
   history stages in two populations that were regenerating after many
   years of population decline. Based on demographic analyses (2001-2004),
   we distinguished between recruits and adult plants. For both sites,
   there was no difference in the proportion of polymorphic loci and
   expected heterozygosity between life history stages. However, spatial
   autocorrelation analyses showed that spatial genetic structure increased
   in magnitude with life history stage. Weak or no spatial genetic
   structure was observed for recruits, whereas adult plants showed a
   pattern that is consistent with that found in other species with a
   predominantly outcrossing mating system. The observed differences
   between seedlings and adults are probably a consequence of changes in
   management of the two study sites and associated demographic changes in
   both populations. Our results illustrate that recurrent population
   crashes and recovery may strongly affect genetic diversity and
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure of plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{The arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Scandinavia is classified as
   critically endangered after having gone through a severe decline in
   population size in the beginning of the 20th century, from which it has
   failed to recover despite more than 65 years of protection. Arctic foxes
   have a high dispersal rate and often disperse over long distances,
   suggesting that there was probably little population differentiation
   within Scandinavia prior to the bottleneck. It is, however, possible
   that the recent decline in population size has led to a decrease in
   dispersal and an increase in population fragmentation. To examine this,
   we used 10 microsatellite loci to analyse genetic variation in 150
   arctic foxes from Scandinavia and Russia. The results showed that the
   arctic fox in Scandinavia presently is subdivided into four populations,
   and that the Kola Peninsula and northwest Russia together form a large
   fifth population. Current dispersal between the populations seemed to be
   very low, but genetic variation within them was relatively high. This
   and the relative F-ST values among the populations are consistent with a
   model of recent fragmentation within Scandinavia. Since the amount of
   genetic variation is high within the populations, but the populations
   are small and isolated, demographic stochasticity seems to pose a higher
   threat to the populations' persistence than inbreeding depression and
   low genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The Steller's sea lion Eumetopias jubatus is an endangered marine mammal
   that has experienced dramatic population declines over much of its range
   during the past five decades. Studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   have shown that an apparently continuous population includes a strong
   division, yielding two discrete stocks, western and eastern. Based on a
   weaker split within the western stock, a third Asian stock has also been
   defined. While these findings indicate strong female philopatry, a
   recent study using nuclear microsatellite markers found little evidence
   of any genetic structure, implying extensive paternal gene flow.
   However, this result was at odds with mark-recapture data, and both
   sample sizes and genetic resolution were limited. To address these
   concerns, we increased analytical power by genotyping over 700
   individuals from across the species' range at 13 highly polymorphic
   microsatellite loci. We found a clear phylogenetic break between
   populations of the eastern stock and those of the western and Asian
   stocks. However, our data provide little support for the classification
   of a separate Asian stock. Our findings show that mtDNA structuring is
   not due simply to female philopatry, but instead reflects a genuine
   discontinuity within the range, with implications for both the
   phylogeography and conservation of this important marine mammal.}},

Abstract = {{Occasional crossbreeding between free-ranging domestic dogs and wild
   wolves (Canis lupus) has been detected in some European countries by
   mitochondrial DNA sequencing and genotyping unlinked microsatellite
   loci. Maternal and unlinked genomic markers, however, might
   underestimate the extent of introgressive hybridization, and their
   impacts on the preservation of wild wolf gene pools. In this study, we
   genotyped 220 presumed Italian wolves, 85 dogs and 7 known hybrids at 16
   microsatellites belonging to four different linkage groups (plus four
   unlinked microsatellites). Population clustering and individual
   assignments were performed using a Bayesian procedure implemented in
   structure 2.1, which models the gametic disequilibrium arising between
   linked loci during admixtures, aiming to trace hybridization events
   further back in time and infer the population of origin of chromosomal
   blocks. Results indicate that (i) linkage disequilibrium was higher in
   wolves than in dogs; (ii) 11 out of 220 wolves (5.0\%) were likely
   admixed, a proportion that is significantly higher than one admixed
   genotype in 107 wolves found previously in a study using unlinked
   markers; (iii) posterior maximum-likelihood estimates of the
   recombination parameter r revealed that introgression in Italian wolves
   is not recent, but could have continued for the last 70 (+/- 20)
   generations, corresponding to approximately 140-210 years. Bayesian
   clustering showed that, despite some admixture, wolf and dog gene pools
   remain sharply distinct (the average proportions of membership to wolf
   and dog clusters were Q(w) = 0.95 and Q(d) = 0.98, respectively),
   suggesting that hybridization was not frequent, and that introgression
   in nature is counteracted by behavioural or selective constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Biological diversity is quantified for reasons ranging from primer
   design, to bioprospecting, and community ecology. As a common index for
   all levels, we suggest Shannon's H-S, already used in information theory
   and biodiversity of ecological communities. Since Lewontin's first use
   of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has been used for
   variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and informativeness of
   pedigrees. However, until now there has been no theory to predict
   expected values of this index under given genetic and demographic
   conditions. We present a new null theory for H-S at the genetic level,
   and show that this index has advantages including (i) independence of
   measures at each hierarchical level of organization; (ii) robust
   estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of conditions; (iii)
   ability to incorporate information on population size; and (iv) explicit
   relationship to standard statistical tests. Utilization of this index in
   conjunction with other existing indices offers powerful insights into
   genetic processes. Our genetic theory is also extendible to the
   ecological community level, and thus can aid the comparison and
   integration of diversity at the genetic and community levels, including
   the need for measures of community diversity that incorporate the
   genetic differentiation between species.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships and the spatial genetic structure of a
   pantropical plant with sea-drifted seeds, Hibiscus tiliaceus L., and its
   allied species were investigated. The combined distribution range of
   these species is over almost the entire littoral area of the tropics
   worldwide, which might result from the dispersal of their sea-drifted
   seeds and from recurrent speciation in local populations. A phylogenetic
   tree constructed using the nucleotide sequences of a c. 7500-bp portion
   of chloroplast DNA suggested the possibility that recurrent speciation
   from H. tiliaceus has given rise to all of its allied species. Three
   major sequence haplotypes of H. tiliaceus had wide and overlapping
   distributions throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions.
   This distribution pattern was also confirmed by PCR-SSCP (polymerase
   chain reaction amplification with single-strand conformation
   polymorphism) and PCR-SSP (PCR amplification with sequence specific
   primers) analyses performed on more than 1100 samples from 65
   populations worldwide. Statistical analysis using F-ST and analysis of
   molecular variance did not show significant genetic differentiation
   among the H. tiliaceus populations in the three oceanic regions. The
   results reported here suggested substantial gene flow occurred between
   populations in the different oceanic regions due to sea-drifted seeds. A
   strong genetic difference between the Pacific and Atlantic populations
   of Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda was observed, which indicates that
   gene flow in this species between the two regions has been prevented.
   The wide and dominant distribution of a haplotype shared by H.
   pernambucensis and H. tiliaceus in the Atlantic region suggests
   significant introgression between the two species in this region.}},

   on the estimated divergence times of Mesobuthus lineages, the temporal
   frame of the genus differentiation in the northeastern Mediterranean
   region is placed in middle Miocene (15 million years ago). The
   biogeographic affinities of M. gibbosus populations point towards a
   mainly vicariant pattern of differentiation of the species which is
   consistent with the geological events that transformed the Aegean region
   during the period from 12 to 5 million years ago. M. gibbosus is an old
   northeastern Mediterranean species that has retained valuable bits of
   genetic information, reflecting some of the oldest vicariant events that
   have occurred in the area. Most importantly, the history witnessed by M.
   gibbosus has not been obscured by more recent palaeoevents of the

Abstract = {{The effect of Pleistocene climate change on the organisms of tropical
   and subtropical regions is rather poorly understood. We therefore
   studied the land snail genus Mandarina (Bradybaenidae) of oceanic
   Ogasawara (Bonin Islands, Japan), with the aim of using population
   genetic data to understand their recent history. Our analysis of a
   mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA region from more than 600 snails in five
   ground-living species suggests that populations on the small islands of
   Mukoujima, Anejima, Imotojima and Meijima, as well as on the low-lying
   southern and central parts of Hahajima, have probably undergone recent
   bottlenecks followed by subsequent expansions. Except between the main
   island of Hahajima and Mukouijima, there is almost no evidence for gene
   flow among islands even though the islands were connected repeatedly by
   land bridges through the Pleistocene. Within islands the population
   structure is severe, suggestive of a long-term, low level of gene flow
   (F-ST is frequently greater than 0.5 among geographically close
   populations). Finally, there is a marked genetic patchiness, meaning
   that genetically close populations are sometimes separated by
   genetically distant populations. These patterns could be a consequence
   of expansion from bottlenecks, low active dispersal and founder effects
   caused by rare long-distance migrants. Unfortunately, the exact nature
   of the refugia and bottlenecks remains unknown because the palaeoclimate
   of this region is poorly understood. Dating the population size changes
   is also challenging because the molecular clock is uncertain. We
   suggest, however, that arid conditions or deforestation induced by
   decreased atmospheric CO2 may have been the main factor in determining
   population size.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship of interpopulation genetic divergence and
   within-population diversity has been studied for many temperate species
   in Europe, but not for the cold-adapted fauna. Here we present the first
   European-wide phylogeographical study of an arctic-alpine distribution
   in invertebrates, focusing on wolf spiders of the Pardosa saltuaria
   group. One hundred twenty-seven (127) specimens from 14 populations were
   examined. Within Europe, these populations were distributed among six
   high mountain ranges and Scandinavia. We sequenced the whole 921 base
   pair mitochondrial (mt) ND1 gene. The resulting 55 unique haplotypes
   form three monophyletic phylogroups of deep divergence: a Pyrenean, a
   Balkan and a `northern' clade. Genetic distances (3.6-4.0\%) between the
   major clades indicate that the arctic-alpine range disjunction was
   initiated by vicariance events, which precede the four major Alpine
   glaciations. However, low divergence and incomplete lineage sorting
   within the `northern clade' suggest a late Pleistocene separation of the
   Alpine, Scandinavian, Carpathian and Sudetian populations. Thus, we
   provide evidence for a multiglacial origin of arctic-alpine
   distributions in Europe, i.e. the current disjunction results from range
   fragmentation in several glacial cycles. The pattern of genetic
   diversity within populations seems predominantly determined by
   historical factors, but is modified by contemporary aspects. Overall,
   diversity and divergence are negatively correlated. We suggest that low
   diversity values might result from (i) ancient bottlenecking during warm
   interglacial periods, as seen in the Pyrenees and Balkans; (ii) recent
   bottlenecking in small modern areas, as seen in the Giant Mountains and
   Bohemian Forest; and (iii) dispersal bottlenecking in northern
   Scandinavia.}},

Abstract = {{Coexistence of recently diverged and ecologically similar sister species
   in complete sympatry represents a particularly compelling case for
   sympatric speciation. This study investigates the possible sympatric
   origin of two coexisting bark beetle taxa that utilize the same host
   plant on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. Aphanarthrum
   subglabrum and Aphanarthrum glabrum ssp. nudum breed inside dead twigs
   of Euphorbia lamarckii plants and are closely related to the allopatric
   A. glabrum ssp. glabrum in Tenerife, El Hierro and La Gomera. We tested
   the various speciation hypotheses in a genealogical context, using
   mitochondrial gene fragments from Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16S, and
   nuclear gene fragments from Enolase, Elongation Factor 1 alpha and
   Histone H3. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined nuclear DNA data
   strongly supported a sister relationship between two sympatric and
   reproductively isolated taxa in La Palma. However, network analyses of
   subdivided nonrecombinant segments of the Enolase locus indicated a
   closer relationship between the two allopatric A. glabrum subspecies,
   suggesting multiple colonizations of this island. A bimodal distribution
   of mtDNA haplotypes in La Palma further documented the independent
   colonization of this island, with asymmetric introgression of mtDNA
   between two lineages. Consequently, the sympatric origin of the La Palma
   species is concluded to have involved allopatric phases before the
   parallel colonization of this island and subsequent introgression at
   some loci. The clear genetic and morphological evidence for reproductive
   isolation between these species suggests that the sympatric completion
   of divergence was either due to initial genetic incompatibility,
   morphological character displacement in male genitalia, or a combination
   of these factors.}},

   occurs in watersheds to the west of the Andes, together with some
   ancient divergences among conspecific populations. In contrast, only one
   species (Percichthys trucha) is found east of the Andes, and little to
   no phylogeographical structure occurs among populations in this region.
   Mismatch analyses of mtDNA sequences suggest that eastern populations
   last went through a major bottleneck c. 188 000 BP, a date consistent
   with the onset of the penultimate and largest Pleistocene glaciation in
   Patagonia. We suggest that eastern populations have undergone repeated
   founder-flush events as a consequence of glacial cycles, and that the
   shallow phylogeny is due to mixing during recolonization periods. The
   area of greater diversity west of the Andes lies outside the northern
   limit of the glaciers. mtDNA mismatch analysis of the genus Percilia
   which is restricted to this area suggests a long-established population
   at equilibrium. We conclude that patterns of genetic diversity in these
   South American genera have been primarily influenced by barriers to gene
   flow (Andean orogeny, and to a lesser extent, isolation in river
   drainages), and by glacial cycles, which have resulted in population
   contraction, re-arrangement of some watersheds, and the temporary
   breakdown of dispersal barriers among eastern river systems.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of many endemic Ponto-Caspian brackish-water taxa are
   subdivided among the Black, Azov and Caspian Sea basins and further
   among river estuaries. Of the two alternative views to explain the
   distributions, the relict school has claimed Tertiary fragmentation of
   the once contiguous range by emerging geographical and salinity
   barriers, whereas the immigration view has suggested recolonization of
   the westerly populations from the Caspian Sea after extirpation during
   Late Pleistocene environmental perturbations. A study of mitochondrial
   (COI) phylogeography of seven mysid crustacean taxa from the genera
   Limnomysis and Paramysis showed that both scenarios can be valid for
   different species. Four taxa had distinct lineages related to the major
   basin subdivision, but the lineage distributions and depths of
   divergence were not concordant. The data do not support a hypothesis of
   Late Miocene (10-5 Myr) vicariance; rather, range subdivisions and
   dispersal from and to the Caspian Sea seem to have occurred at different
   times throughout the Pleistocene. For example, in Paramysis lacustris
   each basin had an endemic clade 2-5\% diverged from the others, whereas
   Paramysis kessleri from the southern Caspian and the western Black Sea
   were nearly identical. Species-specific ecological characteristics such
   as vagility and salinity tolerance seem to have played important roles
   in shaping the phylogeographic patterns. The mitochondrial data also
   suggested recent, human-mediated cryptic invasions of P. lacustris and
   Limnomysis benedeni from the Caspian to the Sea of Azov basin via the
   Volga-Don canal. Cryptic species-level subdivisions were recorded in
   populations attributed to Paramysis baeri, and possibly in P. lacustris.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen flow, seed dispersal and individual reproductive success can be
   simultaneously estimated from the genotypes of adults and offspring
   using stochastic models. Using four polymorphic microsatellite loci,
   gene flow of the wind-pollinated and wind-seed-dispersed dioecious tree
   species, Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica, was quantified in a
   riparian forest, in northern Japan. In a 10.5-ha plot, 74 female adults,
   76 male adults and 292 current-year seedlings were mapped and genotyped,
   together with 200 seeds. To estimate dispersal kernels of pollen and
   seeds, we applied normal, exponential power, Weibull, bivariate
   t-distribution kernels, and two-component models consisting of two
   normal distribution functions, one with a small and one with a large
   variance. A two-component pollen flow model with a small contribution
   (26.1\%) from short-distance dispersal (sigma = 7.2 m), and the rest
   from long-distance flow (sigma = 209.9 m), was chosen for the
   best-fitting model. The average distance that integrated pollen flows
   inside and outside the study plot was estimated to be 196.8 m. Tree size
   and flowering intensity affected reproduction, and there appeared to be
   critical values that distinguished reproductively successful and
   unsuccessful adults. In contrast, the gene flow model that estimated
   both pollen and seed dispersal from established seedlings resulted in
   extensive seed dispersal, and the expected spatial genetic structures
   did not satisfactorily fit with the observations, even for the selected
   model. Our results advanced small-scale individual-based parentage
   analysis for quantifying fat-tailed gene flow in wind-mediated species,
   but also clarified its limitations and suggested future possibilities
   for gene flow studies.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological genetic studies have demonstrated that spatial patterns of
   mating dispersal, the dispersal of gametes through mating behaviour, can
   facilitate inbreeding avoidance and strongly influence the structure of
   populations, particularly in highly philopatric species. Elements of
   breeding group dynamics, such as strong structuring and sex-biased
   dispersal among groups, can also minimize inbreeding and positively
   influence levels of genetic diversity within populations. Rock-wallabies
   are highly philopatric mid-sized mammals whose strong dependence on
   rocky terrain has resulted in series of discreet, small colonies in the
   landscape. Populations show no signs of inbreeding and maintain high
   levels of genetic diversity despite strong patterns of limited gene flow
   within and among colonies. We used this species to investigate the
   importance of mating dispersal and breeding group structure to
   inbreeding avoidance within a `small' population. We examined the
   spatial patterns of mating dispersal, the extent of kinship within
   breeding groups, and the degree of relatedness among brush-tailed
   rock-wallaby breeding pairs within a colony in southeast Queensland.
   Parentage data revealed remarkably restricted mating dispersal and
   strong breeding group structuring for a mid-sized mammal. Breeding
   groups showed significant levels of female kinship with evidence of male
   dispersal among groups. We found no evidence for inbreeding avoidance
   through mate choice; however, anecdotal data suggest the importance of
   life history traits to inbreeding avoidance between first-degree
   relatives. We suggest that the restricted pattern of mating dispersal
   and strong breeding group structuring facilitates inbreeding avoidance
   within colonies. These results provide insight into the population
   structure and maintenance of genetic diversity within colonies of the
   threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby.}},

Abstract = {{According to the size-advantage hypothesis, protandric sequential
   hermaphroditism is expected when the increase in reproductive success
   with age or size is small for males but large for females.
   Interestingly, some protandrous molluscs have developed gregarious
   strategies that might enhance male reproductive success but at the cost
   of intraspecific competition. The gastropod Crepidula fornicata, a
   European invading species, is ideal for investigating mating patterns in
   a sequential hermaphrodite in relation to grouping behaviour because
   individuals of different size (age) live in perennial stacks,
   fertilization is internal and embryos are brooded. Paternity analyses
   were undertaken in stacks sampled in three close and recently invaded
   sites in Brittany, France. Paternity assignment of 239 larvae, sampled
   from a set of 18 brooding females and carried out using five
   microsatellite loci, revealed that 92\% of the crosses occurred between
   individuals located in the same stack. These stacks thus function as
   independent mating groups in which individuals may reproduce
   consecutively as male and female over a short time period, a pattern
   explained by sperm storage capacity. Gregariousness and sex reversal are
   promoting reproductive insurance in this species. In addition, females
   are usually fertilized by several males (78\% of the broods were
   multiply sired) occupying any position within the stack, a result
   reinforcing the hypothesis of sperm competition. Our study pointed out
   that mating behaviours and patterns of gender allocation varied in
   concert across sites suggesting that multiple paternities might enhance
   sex reversal depending on sperm competition intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Harbour seals sometimes breed along inland travel corridors where
   females become clustered in space and time and males establish
   underwater acoustic display territories similar to terrestrial arenas
   known as resource-based leks. Under these conditions, we predicted that
   higher levels of polygyny would be observed than has been previously
   reported for this species mating in open coast environments without
   travel corridors. Reproductive success (RS) of 70 males was measured
   using 20 microsatellite DNA loci and likelihood-based paternity analysis
   of 136 offspring collected over 3 years. Most males were assigned either
   zero or one paternity with 80\% confidence. The greatest number of pups
   assigned to one male in a season was two. Variance in RS was higher for
   males than females (which are biologically limited to one offspring per
   year) indicating low to mild polygyny. In addition, distributions of
   relatedness values among pups within year classes did not differ
   significantly from a simulated distribution with R = 0, indicating that
   half-siblings were uncommon. Overall, polygyny levels were low relative
   to terrestrial pinniped mating systems and similar to observations from
   a harbour seal population along an open coast. Due to large confidence
   intervals associated with our results, we cannot rule out the hypothesis
   that a travel corridor might increase the degree of polygyny skew
   relative to that observed in open coast environments. Habitat appeared
   to influence male strategies as the most successful males in open coast
   environments patrolled offshore, while the most successful male in this
   study defended a territory along the travel corridor.}},

Abstract = {{Most mammalian groups are characterized by male-biased sexual size
   dimorphism, in which size-dependent male-male competition and
   reproductive skew are tightly linked. By comparison, little is known
   about the opportunity for sexual selection in mammalian systems without
   male-biased dimorphism, where the traits under sexual selection might be
   less obvious. We examined 10 years of parentage data in a colony of
   greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) to determine the
   magnitude of male reproductive skew and the opportunity for sexual
   selection in a mammal in which females are the larger sex. Annual
   paternity success was weakly skewed but consistent patterns led to
   strong longitudinal paternity skew among breeders. Just three males
   accounted for a third of all paternity assignments, representing at
   least a fifth of all colony offspring born in a decade. Paternity
   success was in part determined by age but was not influenced by
   dispersal status. Our results show that paternity skew and the
   opportunity for sexual selection in a species with reversed sexual size
   dimorphism can approach levels reported for classical examples of
   species with polygyny and male-biased dimorphism, even where the traits

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of comparative genomics is to identify specific
   genetic changes associated with the evolution of a novel adaptation or
   trait. We need to be able to disassociate the genes involved with a
   particular character from all the other genetic changes that take place
   as lineages diverge. Here we show that by comparing the transcriptional
   profile of segregating families with that of parent species differing in
   a novel trait, it is possible to narrow down substantially the list of
   potential target genes. In addition, by assuming synteny with a related
   model organism for which the complete genome sequence is available, it
   is possible to use the cosegregation of markers differing in
   transcription level to identify regions of the genome which probably
   contain quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the character. This novel
   combination of genomics and classical genetics provides a very powerful
   tool to identify candidate genes. We use this methodology to investigate
   zinc hyperaccumulation in Arabidopsis halleri, the sister species to the
   model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We compare the transcriptional
   profile of A. halleri with that of its sister nonaccumulator species,
   Arabidopsis petraea, and between accumulator and nonaccumulator F(3)s
   derived from the cross between the two species. We identify eight genes
   which consistently show greater expression in accumulator phenotypes in
   both roots and shoots, including two metal transporter genes (NRAMP3 and
   ZIP6), and cytoplasmic aconitase, a gene involved in iron homeostasis in
   mammals. We also show that there appear to be two QTLs for zinc
   accumulation, on chromosomes 3 and 7.}},

Abstract = {{Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that infect
   many arthropod species and may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI),
   resulting in abortive embryonic development. One Wolbachia host, Culex
   pipiens complex mosquitoes, displays high levels of variability in both
   CI crossing types (cytotypes) and DNA markers. We report here an
   analysis of 14 mosquito strains, containing 13 Wolbachia variants, and
   with 13 different cytotypes. Cytotypes were Wolbachia-dependent, as
   antibiotic treatment rendered all strains tested compatible. Cytotype
   distributions were independent of geographical distance between sampling
   sites and host subspecies, suggesting that Wolbachia does not promote a
   reproductive isolation depending on these parameters. Backcross analysis
   demonstrated a mild restoring effect of the nuclear genome, indicating
   that CI is mostly cytoplasmically determined for some crosses. No
   correlation was found between the phenotypic and genotypic variability
   of 16 WO prophage and transposon markers, except for the WO prophage
   Gp15 gene, which encodes a protein similar to a bacterial virulence
   factor. However, Gp15 is partially correlated with CI expression,
   suggesting that it could be just linked to a CI gene.}},

Abstract = {{DNA barcoding has revealed unrecognized species in several animal
   groups. In this study we have employed DNA barcoding to examine
   Hyalella, a taxonomically difficult genus of amphipod crustaceans, from

   assessed the extent of species diversity using a species screening
   threshold (SST) set at 10 times the average intrapopulation cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotype divergence. Despite the fact that this
   threshold approach is more conservative in delineating provisional
   species than the phylogenetic species concept, our analyses revealed
   extraordinary levels of cryptic diversity and endemism. The SST
   discriminated two provisional species within Hyalella sandra, and 33
   provisional species within Hyalella azteca. COI nucleotide divergences
   among these provisional species ranged from 4.4\% to 29.9\%. These
   results have important implications for the conservation of life in

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation increases the migration distances among remnant
   populations, and is predicted to play a significant role in altering
   both demographic and genetic processes. Nevertheless, few studies have
   evaluated the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation in light of
   information about population dynamics in the same set of organisms. In a
   10 000-km(2) experimentally fragmented landscape of rainforest reserves
   in central Amazonia, we examine patterns of genetic variation (amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs) in the epiphyllous (e.g.
   leaf-inhabiting) liverwort Radula flaccida Gott. Previous demographic
   work indicates that colonization rates in this species are significantly
   reduced in small forest reserves. We scored 113 polymorphic loci in 86
   individuals representing five fragmented and five experimentally
   unmanipulated populations. Most of the variation (82\%) in all
   populations was harboured at the smallest (400 m(2)) sampling unit. The
   mean ((+/-) SD) within-population genetic diversity (Nei's), of forest
   remnants (0.412 +/- 0.2) was indistinguishable from continuous (0.413
   +/- 0.2) forests. Similarly, F-ST was identical among small (1- and
   10-ha) and large (>= 100-ha) reserves (0.19 and 0.18, respectively), but
   linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci was significantly elevated
   in fragmented populations relative to those in continuous forests. These
   results illustrate that inferences regarding the long-term viability of
   fragmented populations based on neutral marker data alone must be viewed
   with caution, and underscore the importance of jointly evaluating
   information on both genetic structure and demography. Second, multilocus
   analyses may be more sensitive to the effects of fragmentation in the
   short term, although the effects of increasing linkage disequilibrium on
   population viability remain uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{Both current and historical patterns of variation are relevant to
   understanding and managing ecological diversity. Recently derived
   species present a challenge to the reconstruction of historical patterns
   because neutral molecular data for these taxa are more likely to exhibit
   effects of recent and ongoing demographic processes. We studied
   geographical patterns of neutral molecular variation in a species
   thought to be of relatively recent origin, Tympanuchus phasianellus
   (sharp-tailed grouse), using mitochondrial control region sequences
   (CR-I), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), and
   microsatellites. For historical context, we also analysed CR-I in all
   species of Tympanuchus. Within T. phasianellus, we found evidence for
   restricted gene flow between eastern and western portions of the species
   range, generally corresponding with the range boundary of T. p.
   columbianus and T. p. jamesi. The mismatch distribution and molecular
   clock estimates from the CR-I data suggested that all Tympanuchus
   underwent a range expansion prior to sorting of mitotypes among the
   species, and that sorting may have been delayed as a result of
   mutation-drift disequilibrium. This study illustrates the challenge of
   using genetic data to detect historical divergence in groups that are of
   relatively recent origin, or that have a history dominated by
   nonequilibrium conditions. We suggest that in such cases, morphological,
   ecological, and behavioural data may be particularly important adjuncts
   to molecular data for the recognition of historically or adaptively
   divergent groups.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity is a key factor for the persistence of many
   specialist species in fragmented landscapes. However, connectivity
   estimates have rarely been validated by the observation of dispersal
   movements. In this study, we estimated functional connectivity of a real
   landscape by modelling dispersal for the endangered natterjack toad
   (Bufo calamita) using cost distance. Cost distance allows the evaluation
   of `effective distances', which are distances corrected for the costs
   involved in moving between habitat patches in spatially explicit
   landscapes. We parameterized cost-distance models using the results of
   our previous experimental investigation of natterjack's movement
   behaviour. These model predictions (connectivity estimates from the GIS
   study) were then confronted to genetic-based dispersal rates between
   natterjack populations in the same landscape using Mantel tests.
   Dispersal rates between the populations were inferred from variation at
   six microsatellite loci. Based on these results, we conclude that matrix
   structure has a strong effect on dispersal rates. Moreover, we found
   that cost distances generated by habitat preferences explained dispersal
   rates better than did the Euclidian distances, or the connectivity
   estimate based on patch-specific resistances (patch viscosity). This
   study is a clear example of how landscape genetics can validate
   operational functional connectivity estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the genetic structure of isolated or fragmented species is
   of critical importance when planning a suitable conservation strategy.
   In this study, we use nuclear and chloroplast SSRs (simple sequence
   repeats) to investigate the population genetics of an extremely rare
   sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus Small, which is known from only
   three locations in North America. We investigated levels of genetic
   diversity and population structure compared to a more common congener,
   Helianthus angustifolius L., using both nuclear and chloroplast SSRs. We
   also investigated its proposed hybrid origin from Helianthus
   grosseserratus Martens and H. angustifolius. Twenty- two nuclear SSRs
   originating from the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)
   expressed sequence tag (EST) database, and known to be transferable to
   H. verticillatus and its putative parental taxa, were used in this study
   thereby allowing for statistical control of locus-specific effects in
   population genetic analyses. Despite its rarity, H. verticillatus
   possessed significantly higher levels of genetic diversity than H.
   angustifolius at nuclear loci and equivalent levels of chloroplast
   diversity. Significant levels of population subdivision were observed in
   H. verticillatus but of a magnitude comparable to that of H.
   angustifolius. Inspection of multilocus genotypes also revealed that
   clonal spread is highly localized. Finally, we conclude that H.
   verticillatus is not of hybrid origin as it does not exhibit a mixture
   of parental alleles at nuclear loci, and it does not share a chloroplast
   DNA haplotype with either of its putative parents.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2357-2365}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are found in all
   vertebrates and are an important component of individual fitness through
   their role in disease and pathogen resistance. These genes are among the
   most polymorphic in genomes and the mechanism that maintains the
   diversity has been actively debated with arguments for natural selection
   centering on either additive or nonadditive genetic effects. Here, we
   use a quantitative genetics breeding design to examine the genetic
   effects of MHC class IIB alleles on offspring survivorship in Chinook
   salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We develop a novel genetic algorithm
   that can be used to assign values to specific alleles or genotypes. We
   use this genetic algorithm to show simultaneous additive and nonadditive
   effects of specific MHC class IIB alleles and genotypes on offspring
   survivorship. The additive effect supports the rare-allele hypothesis as
   a potential mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at the MHC.
   However, contrary to the overdominance hypothesis, the nonadditive
   effect led to underdominance at one heterozygous genotype, which could
   instead reduce variability at the MHC. Our algorithm is an advancement
   over traditional animal models that only partition variance in fitness
   to additive and nonadditive genetic effects, but do not allocate these
   effects to specific alleles and genotypes. Additionally, we found
   evidence of nonrandom segregation during meiosis in females that
   promotes an MHC allele that is associated with higher survivorship. Such
   nonrandom segregation could further reduce variability at the MHC and
   may explain why Chinook salmon has one of the lowest levels of MHC
   diversity of all vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the partitioning of genetic variance in peripheral and
   central populations may shed more light on the effects of genetic drift
   and gene flow on population genetic structure and, thereby, improve
   attempts to conserve genetic diversity. We analysed genetic structure of
   peripheral and central populations of three insect-pollinated violets
   (Viola elatior, Viola pumila, Viola stagnina) to evaluate to what extent
   these patterns can be explained by gene flow and genetic drift.
   Amplified fragment length polymorphism was used to analyse 930
   individuals of 50 populations. Consistent with theoretical predictions,
   peripheral populations were smaller and more isolated, differentiation
   was stronger, and genetic diversity and gene flow lower in peripheral
   populations of V. pumila and V. stagnina. In V. elatior, probably
   historic fragmentation effects linked to its specific habitat type were
   superimposed on the plant geographic (peripheral-central) patterns,
   resulting in lower relative importance of gene flow in central
   populations. Genetic variation between regions (3-6\%), among (30-37\%)
   and within populations (60-64\%) was significant. Peripheral populations
   lacked markers that were rare and localized in central populations. Loss
   of widespread markers in peripheral V. stagnina populations indicated
   genetic erosion. Autocorrelation within populations was statistically
   significant up to a distance of 10-20 m. Higher average genetic
   similarity in peripheral populations than in central ones indicated
   higher local gene flow, probably owing to management practices.
   Peripheral populations contributed significantly to genetic variation
   and contained unique markers, which made them valuable for the
   conservation of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Several lineages of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes
   display stunning levels of morphological diversification. The rapid
   evolution of rock-dwelling polygynous mouthbrooders in Lake Malawi, for
   example, was in part ascribed to their allopatric distribution on
   disjunct stretches of rocky coast, where even short habitat
   discontinuities reduce gene flow effectively. However, as seen in other
   cichlids, ecological barriers do not always prevent gene flow, whereas
   genetic structure can develop along continuous habitat, and
   morphological diversification does not necessarily accompany genetic
   differentiation. The present study investigates the population structure
   of Variabilichromis moorii, a monogamous substrate-brooding lamprologine
   of rocky coasts in Lake Tanganyika, which occurs over about 1000 km of
   shoreline almost without phenotypic variation. Phylogeographic analyses
   of mitochondrial DNA sequences indicated that dispersal is infrequent
   and generally occurs between adjacent locations only. Exceptions to this
   pattern are closely related haplotypes from certain locations on
   opposite lakeshores, a phenomenon which has been observed in other
   species and is thought to reflect lake crossing along an underwater
   ridge in times of low water level. Genetic population differentiation,
   estimated from mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data in six adjacent
   populations, was equally high across localities separated by sandy
   shores and along uninterrupted stretches of rocky shore. Our results
   suggest that ecological barriers are not required to induce philopatric
   behavior in Variabilichromis, and that morphological stasis persists in
   the face of high levels of neutral genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in 13 populations of the Alpine newt, Triturus
   alpestris, was assessed at the northeastern margin of its range
   (southern Poland). Variation at six microsatellite loci was scored in
   354 newts, and two mitochondrial DNA fragments (c. 2000 bp) were
   sequenced in a subset of 27 individuals. Significant differences in
   allele frequencies and the presence of private alleles determined
   genetic units corresponding to three separate mountain ranges, i.e. the
   Carpathian, Sudetes and Holy Cross Mountains. F-ST's were three times
   greater in among than in within mountain range pairwise comparisons. An
   assignment test and pairwise F-ST's suggested relatively high levels of
   gene flow at the local level, although the Sudetes populations revealed
   some subtle structuring. Genetic variation was lower in the Carpathians
   and Holy Cross Mountains. The geographic pattern of mitochondrial DNA
   variation indicated that these newt populations originated from a single
   glacial refugium/founder population, and that the colonization of
   southern Poland took place in an easterly direction. The data show that
   substantial neutral variation and between group divergence has
   accumulated relatively quickly in these low-vagility organisms. The
   Alpine newt case exemplifies species history as a factor determining
   patterns of genetic diversity in marginal populations.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The postglacial recolonization of northern North America was heavily
   influenced by the Pleistocene glaciation. In the Pacific Northwest,
   there are two disjunct regions of mesic temperate forest, one coastal
   and the other interior. The chestnut-backed chickadee is one of the
   species associated with this distinctive ecosystem. Using seven
   microsatellite markers we found evidence of population structure among
   nine populations of chestnut-backed chickadees. High levels of allelic
   variation were found in each of the populations. Northern British
   Columbia and central Alaska populations contained a large number of
   private alleles compared to other populations, including those from
   unglaciated regions. The disjunct population in the interior was
   genetically distinct from the coastal population. Genetic and historical
   records indicate that the interior population originated from
   postglacial inland dispersal. Population structuring was found within
   the continuous coastal population, among which the peripheral
   populations, specifically those on the Queen Charlotte Islands and the
   central Alaska mainland, were genetically distinct. The pattern of
   population structure among contemporary chickadee populations is
   consistent with a pioneer model of recolonization. The persistence of
   genetic structure in western North American chestnut-backed chickadees
   may be aided by their sedentary behaviour, linear distribution, and
   dependence on cedar-hemlock forests.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of traditional farmers' management on genetic diversity of
   vegetatively propagated crops is poorly documented. In this study, we
   analysed the impact of ennoblement of spontaneous yams, an original
   traditional farmers' practice, on the genetic diversity of yam
   (Dioscorea sp.) in Benin. We used 11 microsatellite markers on yam
   tubers from a small village in northern Benin and demonstrated that wild
   x cultivated hybrids are spontaneously formed. Many of the spontaneous
   yams collected by farmers from surrounding savannah areas for
   ennoblement were shown to be of wild and hybrid genotypes. Moreover, we
   demonstrated that some yam varieties have a wild or hybrid signature.
   Lastly, we performed a broader ranging genetic analysis on yam material
   from throughout Benin and showed that this practice is used in different
   ecological and ethno-linguistic regions. Through this practice, farmers
   create new varieties with new genetic combinations via sexual
   reproduction of wild and cultivated yams. This system, whereby a sexual
   cycle and asexual propagation are mixed, ensures potential large-scale
   cultivation of the best genotypes while preserving the potential for

Abstract = {{The primary succession on glacier forelands is characterized by a
   sequence of early and late successional species, but whether there is
   also a chronosequence at the intraspecific, genetic level is a matter of
   debate. Two opposing hypotheses differ in their prediction of genetic
   diversity in colonizing populations due to founder effects and
   postcolonization gene immigration. The development of genetic diversity
   in the pioneer Saxifraga aizoides was investigated along a successional
   gradient on two parallel glacier forelands, in order to test whether
   populations from older successional stages were less genetically diverse
   than populations from younger successional stages, and to locate the
   sources of the propagules that originally colonized new glacier
   foreland. Genetic diversity was determined with amplified fragment
   length polymorphisms, and potential sources of colonizing propagules
   were assessed via assignment tests. Our results indicate considerable
   postcolonization gene flow among populations on glacier forelands, since
   population differentiation was low and genetic diversity within
   populations was significantly higher. Molecular diversity and
   differentiation of populations did not develop linearly. Dispersal
   events within the glacier foreland, from the adjacent valley slopes, and
   from parallel glacier valleys were identified. In summary, it seems that
   the colonization of glacier forelands in the European Alps is highly

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction and human activity have greatly impacted the natural
   history of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Although the
   genetic diversity of neutral markers has been examined in this
   endangered species, no previous work has examined adaptive molecular
   polymorphisms in the giant panda. Here, the major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) class II DRB locus was investigated in the giant panda,
   using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence
   analysis. Comparisons of DNA samples extracted from faecal and blood
   samples from the same individual revealed that the two materials yielded
   similar quantities and qualities of DNA, as well as identical SSCP
   patterns and allelic sequences, demonstrating the reliability of DNA
   isolation from panda faeces. Analysis of faecal samples from 60 giant
   pandas revealed relatively low number of alleles: seven alleles.
   However, the alleles were quite divergent, varying from each other by a
   range of 7-47 nucleotide substitutions (4-25 amino acid substitutions).
   Construction of a neighbour-joining tree and comparisons among DRB
   alleles from other species revealed that both similar and highly
   divergent alleles survived in the bottlenecked panda populations.
   Despite species-specific primers used and excellent faecal DNA isolated,
   a lower level of heterozygosity than expected was still observed due to
   inbreeding. There were three types of evidence supporting the presence
   of balancing selection in the giant panda: (i) an obvious excess of
   nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous at the antigen-binding
   positions; (ii) trans-species evolution of two alleles between the giant
   panda and other felids; and (iii) a more even distribution of alleles
   than expected from neutrality.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophages of Wolbachia bacteria have been proposed as a potential
   transformation tool for genetically modifying mosquito vectors. In this
   study, we report the presence of the WO-B class of Wolbachia-associated
   phages among natural populations of several mosquito hosts. Eighty-eight
   percent (22/25) of Wolbachia-infected mosquito species surveyed were
   found to contain WO-B phages. WO-B phage orf7 sequence analysis
   suggested that a single strain of WO-B phage was found in most singly
   (23/24) or doubly (1/1) Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. However, the
   single Wolbachia strain infecting Aedes perplexus was found to harbour
   at least two different WO-B phages. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that
   horizontal transmission of WO-B phages has occurred on an evolutionary
   scale between the Wolbachia residing in mosquitoes. On an ecological
   scale, a low trend of co-transmission occurred among specific WO-B
   phages within Wolbachia of each mosquito species. Assessment of the
   density of WO-B phage by real-time quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction (RTQ-PCR) revealed an average relative density of 7.76 x 10(5)
   +/- 1.61 x 10(5) orf7 copies per individual mosquito for a single
   Wolbachia strain infecting mosquitoes, but a threefold higher density in
   the doubly Wolbachia-infected Aedes albopictus. However, the average
   combined density of WO-B phage(s) did not correlate with that of their
   Wolbachia hosts, which varied in different mosquito species. We also
   confirmed the presence of WO-B-like virus particles in the laboratory
   colony of Ae. albopictus (KLPP) morphologically, by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). The viral-like particles were detected after
   purification and filtration of Ae. albopictus ovary extract, suggesting
   that at least one WO-B-like phage is active (temperate) within the
   Wolbachia of this mosquito vector. Nevertheless, the idea of utilizing
   these bacteriophages as transformation vectors still needs more
   investigation and is likely to be unfeasible.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies describe moving hybrid zones. This
   raises the issue of their actual frequency and emphasizes the need for
   methods that enable the detection of zone movements without historical
   records. Asymmetric introgression, usually considered as a signature of
   geographical shift, might be misleading when applied to mitochondrial or
   potentially non-neutral markers. We investigated mitochondrial and
   genomic introgression, using 30 AFLP derived markers, in a
   well-documented moving avian contact zone between two warblers. We found
   no instances of cross-species transmission of mitochondrial DNA but we
   detected nuclear introgression. Introgression levels were higher in the
   expanding species. Highest introgression was observed in populations
   that recently became allopatric than in current sympatric populations,
   which suggests that alien genetic material mainly spread at the time
   just before the receding species became extinct. We propose that either
   local recruitment or positive selection on some loci contribute to this
   pattern. Furthermore, we propose that, when the rarefaction of sexual
   partners drive the hybridization process, movement could be revealed by
   introgression peaking on the rear edge of the moving zone, or in its
   close vicinity.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic patterns of many taxa are explained by Pleistocene
   glaciation. The temperate rainforests within the Pacific Northwest of
   North America provide an excellent example of this phenomenon, and
   competing phylogenetic hypotheses exist regarding the number of
   Pleistocene refugia influencing genetic variation of endemic organisms.
   One such endemic is the Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon
   tenebrosus. In this study, we estimate this species' phylogeny and use a
   coalescent modeling approach to test five hypotheses concerning the
   number, location and divergence times of purported Pleistocene refugia.
   Single refugium hypotheses include: a northern refugium in the Columbia
   River Valley and a southern refugium in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains.
   Dual refugia hypotheses include these same refugia but separated at
   varying times: last glacial maximum (20 000 years ago), mid-Pleistocene
   (800 000 years ago) and early Pleistocene (1.7 million years ago).
   Phylogenetic analyses and inferences from nested clade analysis reveal
   distinct northern and southern lineages expanding from the Columbia
   River Valley and the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, respectively. Results
   of coalescent simulations reject both single refugium hypotheses and the
   hypothesis of dual refugia with a separation date in the late
   Pleistocene but not hypotheses predicting dual refugia with separation
   in early or mid-Pleistocene. Estimates of time since divergence between
   northern and southern lineages also indicate separation since early to
   mid-Pleistocene. Tests for expanding populations using mismatch
   distributions and `g' distributions reveal demographic growth in the
   northern and southern lineages. The combination of these results
   provides strong evidence that this species was restricted into, and
   subsequently expanded from, at least two Pleistocene refugia in the
   Pacific Northwest.}},

Abstract = {{Delimiting the boundaries of species involved in radiations is critical
   to understanding the tempo and mode of lineage formation. Single locus
   gene trees may or may not reflect the underlying pattern of population
   divergence and lineage formation, yet they constitute the vast majority
   of the empirical data in species radiations. In this study we make use
   of an expressed sequence tag (EST) database to perform nuclear (nDNA)
   and mitochondrial (mtDNA) genealogical tests of species boundaries in
   Ambystoma ordinarium, a member of an adaptive radiation of metamorphic
   and paedomorphic salamanders (the Ambystoma tigrinum complex) that have
   diversified across terrestrial and aquatic environments. Gene tree
   comparisons demonstrate extensive nonmonophyly in the mtDNA genealogy of
   A. ordinarium, while seven of eight independent nuclear loci resolve the
   species as monophyletic or nearly so, and diagnose it as a well-resolved
   genealogical species. A differential introgression hypothesis is
   supported by the observation that western A. ordinarium localities
   contain mtDNA haplotypes that are identical or minimally diverged from
   haplotypes sampled from a nearby paedomorphic species, Ambystoma
   dumerilii, while most nDNA trees place these species in distant
   phylogenetic positions. These results provide a strong example of how
   historical introgression can lead to radical differences between gene
   trees and species histories, even among currently allopatric species
   with divergent life history adaptations and morphologies. They also
   demonstrate how EST-based nuclear resources can be used to more fully
   resolve the phylogenetic history of species radiations.}},

Abstract = {{Birds of the Northern Hemisphere often harbour the genetic signature of
   postglaciation expansion but analyses identifying the location of
   refugia and the directionality of expansions are rare. Here we explore
   the evolutionary history of yellow warbler lineages, focusing on how
   these lineages recolonized their current range. We genotyped samples
   from 696 yellow warblers via direct sequencing of a 333-bp control
   region I mitochondrial DNA fragment or lineage-specific genotyping.
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed two monophyletic clades: a highly
   migratory group including previously identified eastern and western
   lineages and a less migratory group including a lineage consisting of
   tropical residents and a new `southern' lineage localized in southwest
   United States. We then modelled the expansion of the eastern and western
   lineages, identified the location of potential refugia and assessed the
   importance of migration as a historical factor promoting gene flow. The
   expansion of the eastern lineage proceeded from a main refugia in the
   eastern United States, with possible contribution of an additional local
   refugia. In the western lineage, the expansion proceeded from a single
   refugia possibly located in western United States. Because two lineages
   overlapped to varying degrees in central North America, we suggest that
   the Canadian Prairies offered a bridge of riparian habitats where the
   lineages met after glacier retreat, while the US Central Great Plains
   acted as a barrier that limited secondary contact. Finally, gene flow
   was more important along the north-south axis of migration than away
   from it, suggesting spring migration played a role in the dispersal of
   lineages.}},

Abstract = {{Feral rye (Secale cereale) is a serious, introduced weed of dry land
   agricultural regions of the western United States. It closely resembles
   cultivated cereal rye (Secale cereale cereale L.) with the exception of
   having a shattering seed head. Feral rye may have originated from
   hybridization of cultivated rye with mountain rye, Secale strictum, as
   past studies of northern Californian populations suggest, or directly
   from volunteer cultivated rye. We characterized the genetic structure of
   feral rye populations across a broad geographical range and reexamined
   evidence for hybrid origin versus direct evolution from domesticated
   cultivars. Eighteen feral populations were examined from three
   climatically distinct regions in the western United States. Seven
   cultivars, four mountain rye accessions, and one wild annual relative
   (Secale cereale ancestrale) were included in our analysis as possible
   progenitors of feral rye. Individual plants were scored for 14 allozyme
   and three microsatellite loci. Estimates of genetic diversity in feral
   populations were relatively high compared to those of the possible
   progenitors, suggesting that the weed had not undergone a genetic
   bottleneck. Weed populations had no geographical structure at either a
   broad or a local scale, suggesting idiosyncratic colonization and
   gene-flow histories at each site. Feral rye populations were no more
   closely related to mountain rye than cultivars were. They were, however,
   weakly clustered as a distinct lineage relative to cultivars. Our
   results do not support an interspecific hybrid origin for feral rye, but
   do suggest that the sampled populations of feral rye share a common
   ancestry that may explain its weedy nature.}},

Abstract = {{Group formation in humpback whales has been described in relation to
   different components of the migratory cycle, yet it is debated whether
   such groups represent real social bonding or ephemeral aggregations.
   Cooperative behaviours are exhibited during feeding activities, and it
   has been suggested that males may cooperate during competition for
   mates. Since most cooperative behaviours are expected to originate among
   kin, genetic relatedness represents a critical variable in the
   understanding of any social phenomenon, especially when cooperation
   cannot be confirmed unequivocally. Using an approach combining
   multi-locus microsatellite genotyping and several genetic relatedness
   estimators, we analyzed whale associations for two different wintering
   grounds in the Southern Hemisphere. The analyses included 648 whales
   sampled from 292 groups off the coast of Gabon and Northeast Madagascar,
   and screened for eleven microsatellite loci. Through simulations, we
   assessed the performance of three pairwise relatedness estimators. The
   individuals were molecularly sexed and their associations were
   investigated in the context of sex and group type. No significant
   association among relatives was found with the exception of
   mother-offspring pairs, supporting previous indications of extended
   maternal care. The analysis from the Gabon population also suggests that
   related males may avoid each other during competitive activities. Our
   results demonstrate that if cooperative behaviours occur on wintering
   grounds they are not favoured by kin selection.}},

Abstract = {{Although relatedness between mates is of considerable evolutionary and
   ecological significance, the way in which the level of relatedness is
   determined by different behavioural processes remains largely unknown.
   We investigated the role of behaviour in predicting mate relatedness in
   great tits using genotypic markers and detailed observations. We studied
   how mate relatedness is influenced by natal dispersal,
   inbreeding/outbreeding avoidance after natal dispersal and a behaviour
   not previously considered that influences membership to social
   aggregations, namely family escorting behaviour by parents. Among
   locally born individuals, the level of mate relatedness decreased with
   natal dispersal distance for females, but not for males. In contrast,
   mate relatedness was negatively related to the extent of family
   movements for males, but not for females. However, family movements did
   not predict dispersal distance for either sex. Local recruits were more
   related to their mates than immigrants, but this was only significant
   for females. No evidence was found for inbreeding/outbreeding avoidance
   after dispersal. Our results suggest that, in highly mobile species,
   mating options are spatially and/or socially limited, and that parents
   influence mating options of their offspring before dispersal.}},

   revealed no genetic differentiation between nesting females from the two
   locations, or between nesting females and attendant males from the
   Ostional breeding area. Sixty-nine per cent of the nests with MP were
   fathered by a minimum of three different males, and three nests showed
   evidence of at least four fathers. The results suggest that the
   differences observed in levels of MP between arribada and solitary
   rookeries are due to an effect of abundance of individuals on the mating
   system. This is supported by a regression analysis combining other
   paternity studies on sea turtles which shows that levels of MP increase
   with increasing abundance of nesting females.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural observations suggest that orang-utans are semi-solitary
   animals with females being philopatric and males roaming more widely in
   search of receptive partners, leading to the prediction that females are
   more closely related than males at any given site. In contrast, our
   study presents evidence for male and female philopatry in the
   orang-utan. We examined patterns of relatedness and parentage in a wild
   orang-utan population in Borneo using noninvasively collected DNA
   samples from animals observed to defecate, and microsatellite markers to
   assess dispersal and mating strategies. Surprisingly, resident females
   were equally as related to other resident females (mean r(xy) = 0.303)
   as resident males were to other resident males (mean r(xy) = 0.305).
   Moreover, resident females were more related to each other and to the
   resident males than they were to nonresident females, and resident males
   were more related to each other (and resident females) than they were to
   nonresident males. We assigned genetic mothers to 12 individuals in the
   population, while sires could be identified for eight. Both flanged
   males and unflanged males achieved paternity, similar to findings
   reported for Sumatran orang-utans.}},

Abstract = {{Extra-pair paternity is an important aspect of reproductive strategies
   in many species of birds. Given that in most species females control
   whether fertilization occurs, they are expected to benefit in some way
   from the extra-pair matings. In this study we use patterns of extra-pair
   paternity (EPP) in broods of individual reed buntings (Emberiza
   schoeniclus), both within and between seasons, to test four hypothesized
   female benefits: (1) assessing potential future partners and seeking (2)
   genetic diversity (3) good genes, or (4) compatible genes. Reed buntings
   are socially monogamous, multibrooded passerines with extremely high
   levels of extra-pair paternity. We studied a population of reed buntings
   in the Netherlands in 2002 and 2003; 51\% of offspring in 74\% of nests
   were extra-pair. We showed that patterns of EPP did not support the
   first and second hypotheses, since females did not form a pair with
   previous extra-pair partners, EPP was not evenly distributed among
   broods and more broods than expected were sired by a single male.
   Furthermore, there was no relation between a male's within- and
   extra-pair fertilization success, no consistency in EPP between breeding
   attempts, no effect of parental relatedness on EPP and several cases of
   reciprocal paternity. These patterns do not support the good genes
   hypothesis and are most consistent with the genetic compatibility
   hypothesis. However, our previous finding that older males are more
   successful in gaining EPP, suggests some effect of good genes. These
   hypotheses need not be mutually exclusive, as females may select
   compatible males above a certain quality threshold (e.g. old males).}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{A substantial proportion of the primary productivity in grassland
   ecosystems is allocated belowground, sustaining an abundant and diverse
   community of microbes and soil invertebrates. These belowground
   communities drive many important ecosystem functions and are responsive
   to a variety of environmental changes. Nematodes, an abundant and
   diverse component of grassland soil communities, are particularly
   responsive to altered environmental conditions, such as those associated
   with reduced fire frequency and nitrogen enrichment, with the most
   consistent responses displayed by microbial-feeding nematodes. However,
   much of the available research characterizing nematode responses to
   environmental change has been carried out at the taxonomic level of
   family or by broad trophic categories (e.g. fungivores, bacterivores).
   The extent to which differential responses to environmental change
   occurs at the genus level or below is unclear. Therefore, the objective
   of this study was to use molecular methods to quantify the response of
   microbial-feeding nematodes, at the lowest levels of taxonomic
   resolution, to nitrogen enrichment and changes in fire frequency. Using
   sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for
   the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the ITS1 region, we identified 19
   microbial-feeding nematode taxa across four families. When nematodes
   were sampled across treatments, we found that some nematode taxa within
   a family responded similarly to nitrogen and burning treatments, while
   other taxa within the same family respond quite differently.
   Additionally, although nematodes from different families on average
   responded differently to nitrogen enrichment and burning, similar
   responses were seen in nematode taxa that span three taxonomic families.
   Thus, if nematodes are to be used as indicators of environmental change,
   care should be taken to assess the response at the lowest taxonomic
   level possible.}},

Abstract = {{Research on populations from radioactively contaminated areas around
   Chornobyl has produced ambiguous results for the presence of radiation
   effects. More studies are needed to provide information on whether
   radiation exposure at Chornobyl significantly affected genetic diversity
   in natural populations of various taxa. Eleven and nine variable
   microsatellite loci were used to test for differences in genetic
   diversity between reference and Chornobyl populations of two cattail
   species (Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia, respectively) from
   Ukraine. Our purpose was to determine whether radiation had a
   significant impact on genetic diversities of the Chornobyl Typha
   populations, or if their genetic composition might be better explained
   by species demography and/or changes in population dynamics, mainly in
   sexual and asexual reproduction. Populations closest to the reactor had
   increased genetic diversities and high number of genets, which likely
   were due to factors other than radiation including increased gene flow
   among Chornobyl populations, enhanced sexual reproduction within
   populations, and/or origin of the genets from seed bank. Both Typha
   species also demonstrated small but significant effects associated with
   latitude, geographical regions, and watersheds. Typha's demography in
   Ukraine possibly varies with these three factors, and the small
   difference between Chornobyl and reference populations of T. latifolia
   detected after partitioning the total genetic variance between them is
   probably due primarily to these factors. However, the positive
   correlations of several genetic characteristics with radionuclide
   concentrations suggest that radiation may have also affected genetics of
   Chornobyl Typha populations but much less than was expected considering
   massive contamination of the Chornobyl area.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the role of selection in the maintenance
   of a dorsal colour polymorphism in natural populations of the northern
   leopard frog, Rana pipiens. We determined genetic structure both
   spatially and temporally from a suite of putatively neutral molecular
   markers and tested whether or not the colour locus exhibited patterns of
   genetic variation that differed from those of the neutral loci. Spatial
   genetic structure at the colour locus was indistinguishable from
   structure at neutral loci {[}95\% confidence intervals of F-ST (neutral)
   = (0.07, 0.35), F-ST (colour locus) = 0.114]. In the temporal analysis,
   we found that the variance among populations in the change in allele
   frequency at the colour locus (equal to 0.004) lies within the 95\%
   confidence intervals for the variance among populations in changes in
   allele frequencies at neutral loci. In light of our inability to show
   evidence for the selective maintenance of the colour polymorphism, we
   used computer simulations to infer the power of our spatial and temporal
   techniques to detect selection. The computer simulations showed that
   although the strength of selection (s) would need to be relatively
   strong to have been detected by the temporal approach (s = 0.1-0.4,
   depending on the model tested), the spatial analysis would have detected
   all but weak selection (s = 0.01-0.04, depending on the model tested).
   This study illustrates the importance of using a locus comparison
   approach to detect evidence for selective maintenance before conducting
   studies to measure the selective mechanisms maintaining a polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{A basic challenge in evolutionary biology is to establish links between
   ecology and evolution of species. One important link is the habitat
   template. It has been hypothesized, that the spatial and temporal
   settings of a habitat strongly influence the evolution of species
   dispersal propensity. Here, we evaluate the importance of the habitat
   type on genetic population differentiation of species using freshwater
   habitats as a model system. Freshwater habitats are either lentic
   (standing) or lotic (running). On average, lotic habitats are more
   stable and predictable over space and time than lentic habitats.
   Therefore, lentic habitats should favour the evolution of higher
   dispersal propensity which ensures population survival of lentic
   species. To test for such a relationship, we used extensive data on
   species' genetic population differentiation of lentic and lotic
   freshwater invertebrates retrieved from published allozyme studies.
   Overall, we analysed more than 150 species from all over the world.
   Controlling for several experimental, biological and geographical
   confounding effects, we always found that lentic invertebrates exhibit,
   on average, lower genetic population differentiation than lotic species.
   This pattern was consistent across insects, crustaceans and molluscs.
   Our results imply fundamental differences in genetic population
   differentiation among species adapted to either lentic or lotic
   habitats. We propose that such differences should occur in a number of
   other habitat types that differ in spatio-temporal stability.
   Furthermore, our results highlight the important role of lotic habitats
   as reservoirs for evolutionary processes and the potential for rapid
   speciation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated to what extent the soil seed bank differed genetically
   and spatially in comparison to three consecutive life history stages
   (seedlings, mature plants, and fruiting plants) in a natural population
   of Atriplex tatarica. Representatives of particular life history stages
   from twenty subunits within a large population were randomly collected
   and subjected to allozyme analysis. Comparison of population
   polymorphism among various life history stages showed significant
   differences in observed heterozygosity (H-O) and F statistics (F-IS and
   F-ST), but nonsignificant ones in the cases of number of alleles per
   polymorphic locus (A) and gene diversity (H-S). These results indicate
   an increasing number of heterozygotes, a decreasing level of inbreeding
   and an increase of the partitioning genetic diversity among populations
   with increasing population age. Spatial autocorrelation was used to
   calculate f, the average co-ancestry coefficient between individuals
   within distance intervals of two meters along a 39 m long transect.
   Significant positive fine scale genetic structure was detected in mature
   and fruiting plants but not in soil seeds and seedlings stages. The
   results of the presented study on A. tatarica indicated that significant
   differences exist in genetic differentiation, differentiation in allele
   frequencies and spatial autocorrelation among early (soil seeds and
   seedlings) and late (mature and fruiting plants) life history stages but
   not within early and late ones. This pattern suggests that, rather than
   storing genetic variability in the soil or germination and establishment
   success, self-thinning might be the major microselective force in

Abstract = {{In cyclic populations, high genetic diversity is currently reported
   despite the periodic low numbers experienced by the populations during
   the low phases. Here, we report spatio-temporal monitoring at a very
   fine scale of cyclic populations of the fossorial water vole (Arvicola
   terrestris) during the increasing density phase. This phase marks the
   transition from a patchy structure (demes) during low density to a
   continuous population in high density. We found that the genetic
   diversity was effectively high but also that it displayed a local
   increase within demes over the increasing phase. The genetic diversity
   remained relatively constant when considering all demes together. The
   increase in vole abundance was also correlated with a decrease of
   genetic differentiation among demes. Such results suggest that at the
   end of the low phase, demes are affected by genetic drift as the result
   of being small and geographically isolated. This leads to a loss of
   local genetic diversity and a spatial differentiation among demes. This
   situation is counterbalanced during the increasing phase by the spatial
   expansion of demes and the increase of the effective migration among
   differentiated demes. We provide evidences that in cyclic populations of
   the fossorial water voles, the relative influence of drift operating
   during low density populations and migration occurring principally while
   population size increases interacts closely to maintain high genetic
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental risks of Bt maize, particularly pollen drift from Bt

   trials on 6 ha total. Three treatments were used in a randomized block
   design with eight replications resulting in 24 plots: (i) near-isogenic
   control variety without insecticide (control), (ii) near-isogenic
   control variety with chemical insecticide (Baytroid) and (iii) Bt maize
   expressing the recombinant toxin. We established a weed strip (20 x 1 m)
   in every plot consisting of a Chenopodium album (goosefoot)/Sinapis alba
   (mustard) mixture. In these strips we measured diversity and abundance
   of lepidopteran larvae during maize bloom and pollen shed. C. album
   hosted five species but all in very low densities; therefore data were
   not suitable for statistical analysis. S. alba hosted nine species in
   total. Most abundant were Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae. For
   these species no differences were detected between the Bt treatment and
   the control, but the chemical insecticide treatment reduced larval

Abstract = {{Marginal populations are often isolated and under extreme selection
   pressures resulting in anomalous genetics. Consequently, ecosystems that
   are geographically and ecologically marginal might have a large share of
   genetically atypical populations, in need of particular concern in
   management of these ecosystems. To test this prediction, we analysed
   genetic data from 29 species inhabiting the low saline Baltic Sea, a
   geographically and ecologically marginal ecosystem. On average Baltic
   populations had lost genetic diversity compared to Atlantic populations:
   a pattern unrelated to dispersal capacity, generation time of species
   and taxonomic group of organism, but strongly related to type of genetic
   marker (mitochondrial DNA loci had lost c. 50\% diversity, and nuclear
   loci 10\%). Analyses of genetic isolation by geographic distance
   revealed clinal patterns of differentiation between Baltic and Atlantic
   regions. For a majority of species, clines were sigmoid with a sharp
   slope around the Baltic Sea entrance, indicating impeded gene flows
   between Baltic and Atlantic populations. Some species showed signs of
   allele frequencies being perturbed at the edge of their distribution
   inside the Baltic Sea. Despite the short geological history of the
   Baltic Sea (8000 years), populations inhabiting the Baltic have evolved
   substantially different from Atlantic populations, probably as a
   consequence of isolation and bottlenecks, as well as selection on
   adaptive traits. In addition, the Baltic Sea also acts a refuge for
   unique evolutionary lineages. This marginal ecosystem is thus vulnerable
   but also exceedingly valuable, housing unique genes, genotypes and
   populations that constitute an important genetic resource for management
   and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Information on statistical power is critical when planning
   investigations and evaluating empirical data, but actual power estimates
   are rarely presented in population genetic studies. We used computer
   simulations to assess and evaluate power when testing for genetic
   differentiation at multiple loci through combining test statistics or P
   values obtained by four different statistical approaches, viz. Pearson's
   chi-square, the log-likelihood ratio G-test, Fisher's exact test, and an
   F-ST-based permutation test. Factors considered in the comparisons
   include the number of samples, their size, and the number and type of
   genetic marker loci. It is shown that power for detecting divergence may
   be substantial for frequently used sample sizes and sets of markers,
   also at quite low levels of differentiation. The choice of statistical
   method may be critical, though. For multi-allelic loci such as
   microsatellites, combining exact P values using Fisher's method is
   robust and generally provides a high resolving power. In contrast, for
   few-allele loci (e.g. allozymes and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and
   when making pairwise sample comparisons, this approach may yield a
   remarkably low power. In such situations chi-square typically represents
   a better alternative. The G-test without Williams's correction
   frequently tends to provide an unduly high proportion of false
   significances, and results from this test should be interpreted with
   great care. Our results are not confined to population genetic analyses
   but applicable to contingency testing in general.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic
   variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen
   movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many
   herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and
   biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement
   in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations,
   located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic
   disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern
   Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently
   developed TWOGENER analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective
   number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size
   (A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each
   population. We extended the TWOGENER method by developing inference on
   the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where
   offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species
   with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal
   plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen
   movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the
   effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66)
   and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the
   disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen
   movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in
   disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects
   in Trillium habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleotide variation at the FAH1 and DFR gene regions was surveyed in
   four populations of Arabidopsis lyrata (two European A. l. petraea and
   two North American A. l. lyrata populations). In contrast to previous
   results, levels of variation were not consistently lower in A. l. lyrata
   than in A. l. petraea, and similar degrees of genetic differentiation
   were detected between and within subspecies. These observations and the
   significant genetic differentiation detected among populations suggest
   population substructure and no real subdivision between subspecies. For
   each gene studied, genotypic data were obtained, which allowed comparing
   nucleotide diversity within individuals (between sequences from the same
   individual) and within populations (between sequences from the same
   population). The generally lower level of variation within than among
   individuals detected in each population yielded a significant deviation
   from panmixia within populations. In three of the four populations
   studied, two highly divergent alleles were detected within populations
   at the highly variable DFR locus. This pattern and the significant
   excess of derived variants detected in most populations suggest that

Abstract = {{We investigated the short-term impact of disturbance on genetic
   diversity and structure of the tropical butterfly Drupadia theda Felder
   (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Populations were sampled from five landscapes
   in East Kalimantan (Borneo, Indonesia) which were differentially
   disturbed by selective logging and the 1997/1998 El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO)-induced drought and fires. Sampling occurred before
   (in 1997) and after the forest fires (in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2004).
   Drupadia theda populations underwent serious population size reductions
   following the 1997/1998 ENSO event. For a total of 208 individuals, we
   sequenced a 509-bp segment of mtDNA containing the control region plus
   the 5' end of the 12S rDNA gene. Haplotype diversity in D. theda
   populations ranged from 0.468 to 0.953. Just after the 1997/1998 ENSO
   event, number of recorded individuals and genetic diversity were very
   low in D. theda populations sampled in the two severely burned areas and
   in a small pristine forest fragment that was surrounded by burned forest
   and thereby affected by drought. Interestingly, higher levels of genetic
   diversity were observed in logged forest compared to proximate pristine
   forest. After 1998, the genetic composition within the three
   ENSO-disturbed areas diverged. In the twice-burned forest, the genetic
   diversity in 1999 already approached pre-fire levels, while it remained
   nearly unchanged in proximate once-burned forest. Our data suggest that
   the 1997/1998 ENSO-induced drought and fires caused massive reductions
   in the genetic diversity of D. theda and that population recoveries were
   linked to their geographical position relative to patches of unburned
   forest (and thus to source populations).}},

   Extraction of DNA from ancient samples from Crimea (E. hydruntinus) and
   Iran (E. cf. hydruntinus) yielded 134-288 bp of the mtDNA control region
   and 143 bp of the cytochrome b gene. This DNA analysis supports the
   proximity of E. hydruntinus and Equus hemionus suggested by skull and
   limb bone analyses, and rejects proximity to either Equus burchelli or
   the asses suggested by tooth morphology. Dental morphology may thus be
   of poor taxonomical value if used alone for establishing equid
   phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, the small genetic distance
   between E. cf. hydruntinus of Iran and the classical E. hydruntinus of
   Crimea suggests that both samples belong to the same species.
   Accordingly, the geographic range of E. hydruntinus - until now believed
   to be restricted to Europe, Israel, and Turkey - can be extended towards
   East as far as Iran.}},

Abstract = {{Life history traits of highly vagile marine species, such as adult
   reproductive success and larval dispersal, are strongly determined by
   oceanographic and climatic forces. Nevertheless, marine organisms may
   show restricted dispersal in time and space. Patterns of isolation by
   distance (IBD) have been repeatedly observed in marine species. If
   spawning time is a function of geographical location, temporal and
   spatial isolation, can easily be confounded or misinterpreted. In this
   study, we aimed at discriminating between various forces shaping the
   genetic composition of recruiting juveniles of the European eel
   (Anguilla anguilla L.). By controlling for geographical variation, we
   assessed temporal variation and tested for possible isolation by time
   (IBT) between recruitment waves within and between years. Using 12
   polymorphic allozyme and six variable microsatellite loci, we show that
   genetic differentiation was low (F-ST = 0.01-0.002) and significant
   between temporal samples. Regression analysis between genetic and
   temporal distance, was consistent with a subtle interannual pattern of
   IBT. Our data suggest that the population dynamics of the European eel
   may be governed by a double pattern of temporal variance in genetic
   composition: (i) a broad-scale IBT of spawning cohorts, possibly as a
   consequence of the large migration loop in anguillids and strong
   variance in annual adult reproductive contribution; and (ii) a
   smaller-scale variance in reproductive success (genetic patchiness)
   within cohorts among seasonally separated spawning groups, most likely
   originating from fluctuating oceanic and climatic forces. The
   consistency of both mechanisms remains to be verified with fine-scale
   analyses of both spawning/migrating aged adults and their offspring to
   confirm the stochastic/deterministic nature of the IBT pattern in eel.}},

Abstract = {{Wild cherry (Prunus avium L.), a partially asexual self-incompatible
   forest tree, shows heterozygote excess, which is a poorly studied
   phenomenon. In three natural populations, we found significant
   heterozygote excess at almost all investigated loci (eight
   microsatellites and markers for the self-incompatibility locus). We
   examined four hypotheses to account for this observed heterozygote
   excess. First, negative F-IS can result from a lack of selfed progeny in
   small populations of outcrossing species. A second explanation for
   negative F-IS is selection during the life cycle of the most
   heterozygous individuals. A third explanation is negative assortative
   mating when reproduction occurs between individuals bearing phenotypes
   more dissimilar than by chance. The last explanation for negative F-IS
   relies on asexual reproduction. Expectations for each hypothesis were
   tested using empirical data. Patterns of F-IS differed among loci.
   Nevertheless, our experimental results did not confirm the small sample
   size hypothesis. Although one locus is probably under a hitch-hiking
   effect from the SI locus, we rejected the effect of the
   self-incompatibility locus for the genome as a whole. Similarly,
   although one locus showed a clear pattern consistent with the selection
   of heterozygous individuals, the heterosis effect over the whole genome
   was rejected. Finally, our results revealed that clonality probably
   explains significant negative F-IS in wild cherry populations when
   considering all individuals. More theoretical effort is needed to
   develop expectations and hypotheses, and test them in the case of
   species combining self-incompatibility and partially asexual
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{To test the Pleistocene interglacial refugia hypothesis with a
   high-elevation mammal, we studied the phylogeography of the mole-shrew
   (Anourosorex yamashinai) using partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
   sequences (737 bases). This shrew is endemic to Taiwan. It is mainly
   distributed in the highlands from 1000 to 2500 m in elevation. We
   examined 103 specimens from 24 localities in three mountain ranges of
   Taiwan and found 36 haplotypes. These haplotypes separated into two
   major phylogroups (Northern and Southern) plus a minor phylogroup
   (Houhuan) of only one haplotype. This demonstrated strong association
   with geography. The formation of these three phylogroups may be the
   result of interglacial refugia during the middle Pleistocene. Distinct
   sublineages were not found within each major phylogroup, suggesting that
   the populations (phylogroups) explosively expanded from the interglacial
   refugia of ancestral founder haplotypes. The present distribution
   pattern of haplotypes suggests that Mount Houhuan is an effective
   refugium in central Taiwan. It was not possible to specify the refugia

   populations from the latter region were particularly polymorphic. There
   was evidence for refuge areas in Italy, the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey
   for F. ornus, which did not share any single chloroplast haplotype with

Abstract = {{Like many other migratory birds, the black-throated blue warbler
   (Dendroica caerulescens) shows pronounced differences in migratory
   behaviour and other traits between populations: birds in the southern
   part of the breeding range have darker plumage and migrate to the
   eastern Caribbean during the winter, whereas those in the north have
   lighter plumage and migrate to the western Caribbean. We examined the
   phylogeography of this species, using samples collected from northern
   and southern populations, to determine whether differentiation between
   these populations dates to the Pleistocene or earlier, or whether
   differences in plumage and migratory behaviour have arisen more
   recently. We analysed variation at 369 bp of the mitochondrial control
   region domain I and also at seven nuclear microsatellites. Analyses
   revealed considerable genetic variation, but the vast majority of this
   variation was found within rather than between populations, and there
   was little differentiation between northern and southern populations.
   Phylogeographic analyses revealed a very shallow phylogenetic tree, a
   star-like haplotype network, and a unimodal mismatch distribution, all
   indicative of a recent range expansion from a single refugium.
   Coalescent modelling approaches also indicated a recent common ancestor
   for the entire group of birds analysed, no split between northern and
   southern populations, and high levels of gene flow. These results show
   that Pleistocene or earlier events have played little role in creating
   differences between northern and southern populations, suggesting that
   migratory and other differences between populations have arisen very
   recently. The implications of these results for the evolution of
   migration and defining taxonomic groups for conservation efforts are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the genetic population structure and phylogeography of the
   montane caddisfly Drusus discolor across its entire range in central and
   southern Europe. The species is restricted to mountain regions and
   exhibits an insular distribution across the major mountain ranges.
   Mitochondrial sequence data (COI) of 254 individuals from the entire
   species range is analysed to reveal population genetic structure. The
   data show little molecular variation within populations and regions, but
   distinct genetic differentiation between mountain ranges. Most
   populations are significantly differentiated based on F-ST and exact
   tests of population differentiation and most haplotypes are unique to a
   single mountain range. Phylogenetic analyses reveal deep divergence
   between geographically isolated lineages. Combined, these results
   suggest that past fragmentation is the prominent process structuring the
   populations across Europe. We use tests of selective neutrality and
   mismatch distributions, to study the demographic population history of
   regions with haplotype overlap. The high level of genetic
   differentiation between mountain ranges and estimates of demographic
   history provide evidence for the existence of multiple glacial refugia,
   including several in central Europe. The study shows that these aquatic
   organisms reacted differently to Pleistocene cooling than many
   terrestrial species. They persisted in numerous refugia over multiple
   glacial cycles, allowing many local endemic clades to form.}},

Abstract = {{To unravel the relationship between the European wild apple, Malus
   sylvestris (L.) Mill., and its domesticated relative M. domestica
   Borkh., we studied chloroplast DNA variation in 634 wild and 422
   domesticated accessions originating from different regions.
   Hybridization between M. sylvestris and M. domestica was checked using
   10 nuclear microsatellites and a Bayesian assignment approach. This
   allowed us to identify hybrids and feral plants escaped from
   cultivation. Sixty-eight genotypes belonging to 12 other wild Malus
   species, including 20 M. sieversii (Ledeb.) Roem. accessions were also
   included in the analysis of chloroplast diversity. Marker techniques
   were developed to type a formerly described duplication and a newly
   detected transversion in the matK gene. Chloroplast DNA variation was
   further investigated using PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Random
   Fragment Length Polymorphism), and haplotypes were constructed based on
   all mutational combinations. A closer relationship than presently
   accepted between M. sylvestris and M. domestica was established at the
   cytoplasmic level, with the detection of eight chloroplast haplotypes
   shared by both species. Hybridization between M. sylvestris and M.
   domestica was also apparent at the local level with sharing of rare
   haplotypes among local cultivars and sympatric wild trees. Indications
   of the use of wild Malus genotypes in the (local) cultivation process of
   M. domestica and cytoplasmic introgression of chloroplast haplotypes
   into M. sylvestris from the domesticated apple were found. Only one of
   the M. sieversii trees studied displayed one of the three main
   chloroplast haplotypes shared by M. sylvestris and M. domestica. This is
   surprising as M. sieversii has formerly been described as the main
   maternal progenitor of the domesticated apple. This study hereby reopens
   the exciting discussion on the origin of M. domestica.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative phylogeography of widespread, codistributed species
   provides unique insights into regional biodiversity and diversification
   patterns. I used partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial genes ND2
   and cyt b to investigate phylogeographic structure in three widespread
   Philippine fruit bats. Ptenochirus jagori is endemic to the oceanic
   region of the Philippines and is most abundant in lowland primary
   forest. Macroglossus minimus and Cynopterus brachyotis are most common
   in disturbed and open habitats and are not endemic. In all three,
   genetic differentiation is present at multiple spatial scales and is
   associated to some degree with Pleistocene landbridge island groups. In
   P. jagori and C. brachyotis, genetic distance is correlated with
   geographic distance; in C. brachyotis and M. minimus, it is correlated
   with the sea-crossing distance between islands. P. jagori has the least
   overall genetic structure of these three species, whereas C. brachyotis
   and M. minimus have more geographic association among haplotypes,
   suggesting that phylogeographic patterns are linked to ecology and
   habitat preference. However, contrary to expectation, the two
   widespread, disturbed habitat species have more structure than the
   endemic species. Mismatch distributions suggest rapid changes in
   effective population size in C. brachyotis and P. jagori, whereas M.
   minimus appears to be demographically more stable. Geologic and
   geographic history are important in structuring variation, and
   phylogeographic patterns are the result of dynamic long-term processes
   rather than simply reflecting current conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate goal of comparative phylogeographical analyses is to infer
   processes of diversification from contemporary geographical patterns of
   genetic diversity. When such studies are employed across diverse groups
   in an array of communities, it may be difficult to discover common
   evolutionary and ecological processes associated with diversification.
   In order to identify taxa that have responded in a similar fashion to
   historical events, we conducted comparative phylogeographical analyses
   on a phylogenetically and ecologically limited set of taxa. Here, we
   focus on a group of squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards) that share
   similar ecological requirements and generally occupy the same
   communities in the western USA. At a gross level, deep genetic division
   in Contia tenuis, Diadophis punctatus, Elgaria multicarinata, the
   Charina bottae complex, and Lampropeltis zonata are often concordant in
   the Transverse Ranges, the Monterey Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
   region, and the southern Sierra Nevada in California. Molecular clock
   estimates suggest that major phyletic breaks within many of these taxa
   roughly coincide temporally, and may correspond to important geological
   events. Furthermore, significant congruence between the phylogeographies
   of E. multicarinata and L. zonata suggests that the succession of
   vicariance and dispersal events in these species progressed in concert.
   Such congruence suggests that E. multicarinata and L. zonata have
   occupied the same communities through time. However, across our entire
   multi-taxon data set, the sequence of branching events rarely match
   between sympatric taxa, indicating the importance of subtle differences
   in life history features as well as random processes in creating unique
   genetic patterns. Lastly, coalescent and noncoalescent estimates of
   population expansion suggest that populations in the more southerly
   distributed clades of C. tenuis, D. punctatus, E. multicarinata, and L.
   zonata have been stable, while populations in more northerly clades
   appear to have recently expanded. This concerted demographic response is
   consistent with palaeontological data and previous phylogeographical
   work that suggests that woodland habitat has become more restricted in
   southern California, but more widespread in the North during Holocene
   warming. Future phylogeographical work focusing on allied and
   ecologically associated taxa may add insight into the ecological and
   evolutionary processes that yield current patterns of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Utah sucker (Catostomus ardens) is endemic to the Bonneville Basin
   and the upper Snake River drainage in western North America, and is
   thought to hybridize with the federally endangered June sucker
   (Chasmistes liorus mictus) in Utah Lake (Bonneville Basin). Here we
   describe the discovery of a major subdivision in Utah suckers (4.5\%
   mitochondrial sequence divergence) between the ancient Snake River
   drainage and the Bonneville Basin. This boundary has not previously been
   recognized in Utah suckers based on morphologic variation, but has been
   recently described in two endemic cyprinids in the region. Populations
   in valleys east of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah clustered with the
   Snake River populations, suggesting that these valleys may have had an
   ancient hydrologic connection to the Snake River. We also found evidence
   of population isolation within the Bonneville Basin, corresponding to
   two Pleistocene sub-basins of the ancient Lake Bonneville. In contrast,
   we found no molecular evidence for deep divergence between Utah suckers
   and June suckers in Utah Lake or for a history of hybridization between
   divergent lineages in that population, although we recognize that
   demographic events may have obscured this signal. These findings suggest
   that the morphological differences between Utah and June suckers in Utah
   Lake may be the result of strong, and relatively recent, ecological
   selection. In summary, morphological and molecular characters seem to
   vary along different axes in different portions of the range of this
   taxon, providing an interesting system for studying the contributions of
   neutral and adaptive variation to species diversity.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Large marine fishes typically have little population genetic structure.
   The exceptions are associated with sedentary behaviour, disjunct
   distributions, or reproductive philopatry. Scalloped hammerhead sharks
   (Sphyrna lewini) incorporate the contrasting traits of oceanic habitat
   (usually associated with high dispersal) and possible fidelity to
   nursery grounds (for reproductive females). To evaluate the expectations
   of these contrasting behaviours, we examined the global genetic
   structure of S. lewini based on collections (n = 271 individuals) from
   20 nursery areas. A 548-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA control region
   revealed 22 polymorphic sites, 24 haplotypes, and three lineages
   distinguished by 2.56-3.77\% sequence divergence. Coalescence analyses
   based on a provisional molecular clock indicate an origin in the
   Indo-West Pacific with late Pleistocene radiations into the central
   Pacific (Hawaii) and eastern Pacific (Central America), as well as
   recent interchange between oceans via southern Africa. Population
   subdivisions are strong (overall Phi(ST) = 0.749, P < 0.0001 and among
   oceans Phi(ST) = 0.598, P < 0.0098). Genetic discontinuity within oceans
   (Phi(ST) = 0.519, P < 0.0001) is primarily associated with oceanic
   barriers (migration across oceans M approximate to 0), with much less
   structure along continental margins (M > 10). We conclude that nursery
   populations linked by continuous coastline have high connectivity, but
   that oceanic dispersal by females is rare. Although we cannot rule out
   philopatry to natal nurseries, oceanic barriers appear to have a much
   stronger influence on the genetic architecture of this species and may
   indicate a mechanism for recent evolutionary radiations in the genus
   Sphyrna.}},

   utilization by genotyping progeny from 20 wild-caught females at four
   highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. Based on indirect paternity
   analyses of 814 flies, we found evidence for high levels of multiple
   paternity coupled with relatively low reproductive output, consistent
   with the high levels of female remating predicted in this sperm-limited

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the use of molecular genetic data to
   infer genealogical relationships among individuals in the absence of
   parental information. Such analyses can provide insight into mating
   systems and estimations of heritability in the wild. In addition,
   accurate pedigree reconstruction among the founders of endangered
   populations being reared in captivity would be invaluable. Many breeding
   programs for endangered species attempt to minimize loss of genetic
   variation and inbreeding through strategies designed to minimize global
   co-ancestry, but they assume a lack of relatedness among the founders.
   Yet populations that are the target of such programs are generally in
   serious demographic decline, and many of the available founders may be
   closely related. Here we demonstrate determination of full and half-sib
   relationships among the wild founders of a captive breeding program
   involving two endangered Atlantic salmon populations using two different
   approaches and associated software, PEDIGREE and COLONY. A large portion
   of the juveniles collected in these two rivers appear to be derived from
   surprisingly few females mating with a large number of males, probably
   small precocious parr. Another group of potential founders, obtained
   from a local hatchery, clearly originated from a small number of
   full-sib crosses. These results allowed us to prioritize individuals on
   the basis of conservation value, and are expected to help minimize loss
   of genetic variation through time. In addition, insight is provided into
   the number of contributing parents and the mating systems that produced
   this last generation of endangered wild Atlantic salmon.}},

Abstract = {{Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in five agricultural
   field sites of different management intensities were studied. Variable
   regions of the ribosomal RNA genes were used to detect and identify AMF
   directly within colonized roots. Roots from a continuous maize
   monoculture showed low AMF diversity, in agreement with previous reports
   on molecular diversity of AMF in agricultural soils. In contrast, a
   substantially higher diversity of AMF was found throughout the long term
   `DOK' field experiment, where organic and conventional agricultural
   practices have been compared side by side since 1978. In this
   experiment, a 7-year crop rotation is performed under lower levels of
   inorganic fertilizer input and chemical pest control. These results are
   in good agreement with analyses of the spore community previously
   conducted in these field sites. In a third site, an organically managed
   leek field with soil of very high phosphate content reflecting the
   highly intensive conventional field history and intensive tillage, we
   detected a low-diversity community comparable to the maize monoculture.
   In addition to fungi from Glomus group A, which have previously been
   reported to dominate arable soils, we regularly found members of the
   genera Scutellospora, Paraglomus and Acaulospora. The genus Acaulospora
   was shown to occur more frequently early in the growing season,
   suggesting that the life history strategy of AMF may influence the
   active community at a given time. These data show that the diversity of
   AMF is not always low in arable soils. Furthermore, low-input
   agriculture involving crop rotation may provide better conditions to
   preserve AMF diversity, by preventing the selection for the few AMF taxa
   tolerating high nutrient levels.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological impacts of invasive plant species are well documented, but
   the genetic response of native species to invasive dominance has been
   often overlooked. Invasive plants can drastically alter site conditions
   where they reach dominance, potentially exerting novel selective
   pressures on persistent native plant populations. Do native plant
   populations in old exotic invasions show evidence of selection when
   compared to conspecific populations in adjacent, noninvaded areas? We
   employ amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to screen
   a large number of loci from two native grass species (Hesperostipa
   comata (Trin. \& Rupr.) Barkworth and Sporobolus airoides Torr.) that
   occur in old infestations of the invasive forb Acroptilon repens. We
   then compare observed locus by locus F-ST values with distributions of
   F-ST estimated from simulation models under expectation of neutrality.
   We also compare the proportion of loci possibly linked to selection and
   those not linked to selection which exhibit parallel trends in
   divergence between two community types (invaded, noninvaded). Few loci
   (H. comata, 2.6\%; S. airoides, 8.7\%) in the two native grasses may be
   linked to genes under the influence of selection. Also, loci linked to
   selection showed a greater portion of parallel trends in divergence than
   neutral loci. Genetic similarities between community types were less
   than genetic similarity within community types suggesting
   differentiation in response to community alteration. These results
   indicate that a small portion of scored AFLP loci may be linked to genes
   undergoing selection tied to community dominance by an invasive species.
   We propose that native plants in communities dominated by exotic
   invasives may be undergoing natural selection.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial ecology examines the diversity and activity of micro-organisms
   in Earth's biosphere. In the last 20 years, the application of genomics
   tools have revolutionized microbial ecological studies and drastically
   expanded our view on the previously underappreciated microbial world.
   This review first introduces the basic concepts in microbial ecology and
   the main genomics methods that have been used to examine natural
   microbial populations and communities. In the ensuing three specific
   sections, the applications of the genomics in microbial ecological
   research are highlighted. The first describes the widespread application
   of multilocus sequence typing and representational difference analysis
   in studying genetic variation within microbial species. Such
   investigations have identified that migration, horizontal gene transfer
   and recombination are common in natural microbial populations and that
   microbial strains can be highly variable in genome size and gene
   content. The second section highlights and summarizes the use of four
   specific genomics methods (phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA,
   DNA-DNA re-association kinetics, metagenomics, and micro-arrays) in
   analysing the diversity and potential activity of microbial populations
   and communities from a variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments.
   Such analyses have identified many unexpected phylogenetic lineages in
   viruses, bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. Functional
   analyses of environmental DNA also revealed highly prevalent, but
   previously unknown, metabolic processes in natural microbial
   communities. In the third section, the ecological implications of
   sequenced microbial genomes are briefly discussed. Comparative analyses
   of prokaryotic genomic sequences suggest the importance of ecology in
   determining microbial genome size and gene content. The significant
   variability in genome size and gene content among strains and species of
   prokaryotes indicate the highly fluid nature of prokaryotic genomes, a
   result consistent with those from multilocus sequence typing and
   representational difference analyses. The integration of various levels
   of ecological analyses coupled to the application and further
   development of high throughput technologies are accelerating the pace of
   discovery in microbial ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Roads present formidable barriers to dispersal. We examine movements of
   two highly mobile carnivores across the Ventura Freeway near Los
   Angeles, one of the busiest highways in the United States. The two
   species, bobcats and coyotes, can disappear from habitats isolated and
   fragmented by roads, and their ability to disperse across the Ventura
   Freeway tests the limits of vertebrates to overcome anthropogenic
   obstacles. We combine radio-telemetry data and genetically based
   assignments to identify individuals that have crossed the freeway.
   Although the freeway is a significant barrier to dispersal, we find that
   carnivores can cross the freeway and that 5-32\% of sampled carnivores
   crossed over a 7-year period. However, despite moderate levels of
   migration, populations on either side of the freeway are genetically
   differentiated, and coalescent modelling shows their genetic isolation
   is consistent with a migration fraction less than 0.5\% per generation.
   These results imply that individuals that cross the freeway rarely
   reproduce. Highways and development impose artificial home range
   boundaries on territorial and reproductive individuals and hence
   decrease genetically effective migration. Further, territory pile-up at
   freeway boundaries may decrease reproductive opportunities for
   dispersing individuals that do manage to cross. Consequently, freeways
   are filters favouring dispersing individuals that add to the migration
   rate but little to gene flow. Our results demonstrate that freeways can
   restrict gene flow even in wide-ranging species and suggest that for
   territorial animals, migration levels across anthropogenic barriers need
   to be an order of magnitude larger than commonly assumed to counteract
   genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Using microsatellites, we investigated population structure and gene
   flow of the short-lived, wind-dispersed plant species Hypochaeris
   radicata in a fragmented agricultural landscape where more than 99\% of
   the nutrient-poor grasslands have disappeared over the last century. We
   sampled populations in the few remaining high density populations in
   conservation areas, as well as individuals that occurred, with lower
   densities, in linear landscape elements, at two spatial scales. In a
   re-inventory of the landscape, after 3 years, both extinctions and
   colonizations of populations were observed. Contrary to expectations, no
   differences in genetic diversity between high and low density
   populations were observed. Both types of populations had relatively high
   levels of diversity. Overall genetic differentiation (theta) was 0.04
   and significantly different from zero (P < 0.01). A significant
   isolation-by-distance pattern was found when all populations were
   simultaneously analysed (r = 0.24, P = 0.013). Isolation by distance was
   (marginally) significant at the small scale (r = 0.32, P = 0.06),
   whereas nonsignificant at the large spatial scale (r = -0.05, P = 0.66).
   A maximization-of-explained-variance procedure resulted in a threshold
   distance of 3.5 km above which populations were effectively genetically
   isolated. An additional partial exclusion Bayesian-based assignment test
   showed that overall 32.3\% of the individuals were assigned to their
   population of origin, 48\% were assigned to another population in the
   area and 19.7\% were not assigned. Together, these results suggest high
   levels of gene flow. Seed dispersal contributes to the observed gene
   flow up to several hundred metres, which is higher than previously
   modelled using aerodynamic models on seed dispersal of H. radicata. We
   discuss the consequences of these results for an evaluation of the
   probability of persistence of this species in the fragmented landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The federally endangered North American Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides
   melissa samuelis) and the closely related Melissa blue butterfly (L. m.
   melissa) can be distinguished based on life history and morphology.
   Western populations of L. m. samuelis share mitochondrial haplotypes
   with L. m. melissa populations, while eastern populations of L. m.
   samuelis have divergent haplotypes. Here we test two hypotheses
   concerning the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in
   western L. m. samuelis populations: (i) mitochondrial introgression has
   occurred from L. m. melissa populations into western L. m. samuelis
   populations, or (ii) western populations of the nominal L. m. samuelis
   are more closely related to L. m. melissa than to eastern L. m. samuelis
   populations, yet are phenotypically similar to the latter. A Bayesian
   algorithm was used to cluster 190 L. melissa individuals based on 143
   informative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. This
   method clearly differentiated L. m. samuelis and L. m. melissa. Thus,
   genomic divergence was greater between western L. m. samuelis
   populations and L. m. melissa populations than it was between western
   and eastern populations of L. m. samuelis. This supports the hypothesis
   that the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in western
   L. m. samuelis populations is the result of mitochondrial introgression.
   These data provide valuable information for conservation and management
   plans for the endangered L. m. samuelis, and illustrate the risks of
   using data from a single locus for diagnosing significant units of
   biodiversity for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary potential of a species is determined by its genetic
   diversity. Thus, management plans should integrate genetic concerns into
   active conservation efforts. The copper redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) is
   an endangered species, with an endemic distribution limited to the
   Richelieu River and a short section of the St Lawrence River in Quebec,
   Canada. The population, gradually fragmented since 1849, is
   characterized by a decline in population size and a lack of recruitment.
   A total of 269 samples were collected between 1984 and 2004 and
   genotyped using 22 microsatellite loci, which indicated that these fish
   comprise a single population, with a global F(ST) value of only 0.0038.
   Despite a small census size (similar to 500), a high degree of genetic
   diversity was observed compared to common values for freshwater fishes
   (average number of 12.5 alleles/locus and average H(O) of 0.77 +/-
   0.08). No difference was observed between expected and observed pairwise
   values of relatedness (r(xy): -0.00013 +/- 0.11737), suggesting an
   outbred population. Long-term N(e) was estimated at 4476 whereas
   contemporary N(e) values ranged from 107 to 568, suggesting a pronounced
   yet gradual demographic decline of the population, as no bottleneck
   could be detected for the recent past. By means of simulations, we
   estimated N(e) would need to remain at more than similar to 400 to
   retain 90\% of the genetic diversity over 100 years. Overall, these
   observations corroborate other recent empirical studies confirming that
   long generation times may act as a buffering effect contributing to a
   reduction in the pace of genetic diversity erosion in threatened
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Marine bivalves are sessile or sedentary as adults but have planktonic
   larvae which can potentially disperse over large distances. Consequently
   larval transport is expected to play a prominent role in facilitating
   gene flow and determining population structure. The sea scallop
   (Placopecten magellanicus) is a dioecious species with high fecundity,
   broadcast spawning and a c. 30-day planktonic larval stage, yet it forms
   discrete populations or `beds' which have significantly different
   dynamics and characteristics. We analysed variation at six
   microsatellite loci in 12 locations throughout the geographic range of
   the species from Newfoundland, Canada, to New Jersey, USA. Significant
   differentiation was present and the maximum pairwise theta value,
   between one of the Newfoundland samples in the north and a sample from
   the southern portion of the range, was high at 0.061. Other proximate
   pairs of samples had no detectable genetic differentiation. Mantel tests
   indicated a significant isolation by distance, but only when one of the
   populations was excluded. A landscape genetic approach was used to
   detect areas of low gene flow using a joint analysis of spatial and
   genetic information. The two major putative barriers inferred by
   Monmonier's algorithm were then used to define regions for an analysis
   of molecular variance (AMOVA). That analysis showed a significant but
   low percentage (1.2\%) of the variation to be partitioned among regions,
   negligible variation among populations within regions, and the majority
   of the variance distributed between individuals within populations.
   Prominent currents were concordant with the demarcation of the regions,
   while a novel approach of using particle tracking software to mimic
   scallop larval dispersal was employed to interpret within-region genetic
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme conditions in subsurface are suspected to be responsible for
   morphological convergences, and so to bias biodiversity assessment.
   Subterranean organisms are also considered as having poor dispersal
   abilities that in turn generate a large number of endemic species when
   habitat is fragmented. Here we test these general hypotheses using the
   subterranean amphipod Niphargus virei. All our phylogenetic analyses
   (Bayesian, maximum likelihood and distance), based on two independent
   genes (28S and COI), revealed the same tripartite structure. N. virei
   populations from Benelux, Jura region and the rest of France appeared as
   independent evolutionary units. Molecular rates estimated via global or
   Bayesian relaxed clock suggest that this split is at least 13 million
   years old and accredit the cryptic diversity hypothesis. Moreover, the
   geographical distribution of these lineages showed some evidence of
   recent dispersal through apparent vicariant barrier. In consequence, we
   argue that future analyses of evolution and biogeography in subsurface,
   or more generally in extreme environments, should consider dispersal
   ability as an evolving trait and morphology as a potentially biased
   marker.}},

Abstract = {{Two species of horned lizards are sympatric along the periphery of the
   Salton Trough. Phrynosoma mcallii, endemic to the trough, is of
   conservation concern because its limited habitat has been fragmented by
   human activities. A more common and widespread species, Phrynosoma
   platyrhinos, occurs around the periphery of the trough and much further
   to the North. The two species are syntopic at a few localities, where
   morphological intermediates have also been found. Here, we used nested
   clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA) and analysis of molecular
   variance (AMOVA), to examine 781 bp of mitochondrial DNA (nad4 and two
   tRNAs) from 82 individuals of P. mcallii. We tested whether populations
   of this species were recently connected, or if they were historically
   isolated prior to human modification of the region. Our NCPA results
   indicated significant population structure associated with the Colorado
   River, suggesting limited gene flow and potential isolation across this
   barrier. Populations west of the Colorado River, currently isolated from
   one another by human development, show less genetic differentiation. We
   also collected homologous sequence data from 34 individuals of P.
   platyrhinos and seven specimens morphologically intermediate between P.
   mcallii and P. platyrhinos, as a preliminary investigation of
   hybridization between these two species. From phylogenetic results of
   these data, we identified a species (Phrynosoma goodei) previously
   recognized as a subspecies of P. platyrhinos. Six of the morphologically
   intermediate specimens shared mtDNA haplotypes with P. goodei, while one
   was nested among P. mcallii haplotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Many arctic-alpine organisms have vast present-day ranges across
   Eurasia, but their history of refugial isolation, differentiation and
   postglacial expansion is poorly understood. The mountain avens, Dryas
   octopetala sensu lato, is a long-lived, wind-dispersed, diploid shrub
   forming one of the most important components of Eurasian tundras and
   heaths in terms of biomass. We address differentiation and migration
   history of the species with emphasis on the western and northern
   Eurasian parts of its distribution area, also including some East
   Greenlandic and North American populations (partly referred to as the
   closely related D. integrifolia M. Vahl). We analysed 459 plants from 52
   populations for 155 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP)
   markers. The Eurasian plants were separated into two main groups,
   probably reflecting isolation and expansion from two major glacial
   refugia, situated south and east of the North European ice sheets,
   respectively. Virtually all of northwestern Europe as well as East
   Greenland have been colonized by the Southern lineage, whereas northwest
   Russia, the Tatra Mountains and the arctic archipelago of Svalbard have
   been colonized by the Eastern lineage. The data indicate a contact zone
   between the two lineages in northern Scandinavia and possibly in the
   Tatra Mountains. The two single populations analysed from the Caucasus
   and Altai Mountains were most closely related to the Eastern lineage but
   were strongly divergent from the remaining eastern populations,
   suggesting survival in separate refugia at least during the last
   glaciation. The North American populations grouped with those from East
   Greenland, irrespective of their taxonomic affiliation, but this may be
   caused by independent hybridization with D. integrifolia and therefore
   not reflect the true relationship between populations from these areas.}},

Abstract = {{The historic processes which have led to the present-day patterns of
   genetic structure in the marine coastal fauna of the Northeast Atlantic
   are still poorly understood. While tectonic uplifts and changes in sea
   level may have caused large-scale vicariance, warmer conditions during
   glacial maxima may have allowed pockets of diversity to persist to a
   much wider extent than in the Northwestern Atlantic. The large-scale
   geographic distribution of deeply divergent lineages of the coastal
   polychaete tubeworms Pectinaria koreni (two clades) and Owenia
   fusiformis (three clades) were compared using a fragment of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (mtCOI). All lineages were
   present along the biogeographic transition zone on the north coast of
   Brittany (France) and we found evidence pointing towards congruence in
   the timing of cladogenic events between Pectinaria sp. (P. auricoma/P.
   belgica and P. koreni) and Owenia sp., suggesting a shared history of
   vicariant events. More conserved 16SrRNA sequences obtained from four
   species of Pectinariidae together with mtCOI sequences of P. koreni seem
   consistent with an initial establishment of pectinariids in the north,
   and a southward colonization of the Northeast Atlantic. Phylogeographic
   patterns in O. fusiformis were also consistent with a north/south
   pattern of lineage splitting and congruent levels of divergence were
   detected between lineages of both species. We observed signatures of
   both persistence in small northern glacial refugia, and of northwards
   range expansion from regions situated closer to the Mediterranean.
   However, whether the recolonization of the Northeast Atlantic by both
   species actually reflects separate interglacial periods is unclear with
   regards to the lack of molecular clock calibration in coastal polychaete
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Continental glaciation has played a major role in shaping the
   present-day phylogeography of freshwater and terrestrial species in the
   Northern Hemisphere. Recent work suggests that coastal glaciation during
   ice ages may have also had a significant impact on marine species. The
   bay pipefish, Syngnathus leptorhynchus, is a near-shore Pacific coast
   fish species with an exceptionally wide latitudinal distribution,
   ranging from Bahia Santa Maria, Baja California to Prince William Sound,
   Alaska. Survey data indicate that S. leptorhynchus is experiencing a
   range expansion at the northern limit of its range, consistent with
   colonization from southern populations. The present study uses six novel
   microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to
   study the present-day population genetic structure of four coastal
   populations of S. leptorhynchus. Deficits in mtDNA and nuclear DNA
   diversity in northern populations from regions glaciated during the last
   glacial maximum (LGM) {[}c. 18 000 years before present (BP)] suggest
   that these populations were effected by glacial events. Direct estimates
   of population divergence times derived from both isolation and
   isolation-with-migration models of evolution are also consistent with a
   postglacial phylogenetic history of populations north of the LGM.
   Sequence data further indicate that a population at the southern end of
   the species range has been separated from the three northern populations
   since long before the last interglacial event (c. 130 000 years BP),
   suggesting that topographical features along the Pacific coast may
   maintain population separation in regions unimpacted by coastal
   glaciation.}},

Abstract = {{Incipient species groups or young adaptive radiations such as crossbills
   (Aves: Loxia) present the opportunity to investigate directly the
   processes occurring during speciation. New World crossbills include
   white-winged crossbills (Loxia leucoptera), Hispaniolan crossbills
   (Loxia megaplaga), and red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex), the
   last of which is comprised of at least nine morphologically and vocally
   differentiated forms ('call types') where divergent natural selection
   for specialization on different conifer resources has been strongly
   implicated as driving diversification. Here we use amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to investigate patterns of genetic
   variation across populations, call types, and species of New World
   crossbills. Tree-based analyses using 440 AFLP loci reveal strongly
   supported clustering of the formally recognized species, but did not
   separate individuals from the eight call types in the red crossbill
   complex, consistent with recent divergence and ongoing gene flow.
   Analyses of genetic differentiation based on inferred allele frequency
   variation however, reveal subtle but significant levels of genetic
   differentiation among the different call types of the complex and
   indicate that between call-type differentiation is greater than that
   found among different geographic locations within call types.
   Interpreted in light of evidence of divergent natural selection and
   strong premating reproductive isolation, the observed genetic
   differentiation suggests restricted gene flow among sympatric call types
   consistent with the early stages of ecological speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Isolation of Mediterranean species in the southern European peninsulas
   during the cold glacial phases often resulted in differentiation of
   several genetic lineages confined to the respective peninsulas. However,
   whilst there is good genetic evidence for multiple refugia in Iberia,
   there are only limited data available for the Balkans. Therefore, we
   wish to examine the hypothesis of a strong genetic structuring within
   southeastern Europe for the existence of multiple Balkan differentiation
   centres and/or several leading edges. As a model we use the marbled
   white butterfly, Melanargia galathea. We studied 18 allozyme loci of 564
   individuals from 16 populations distributed over a large part of
   southeastern Europe. The single populations showed moderately high
   genetic diversity and no northward decline of genetic diversity was
   detected. The overall genetic differentiation between populations was
   considerable (F(ST) 7.0\%). Cluster analysis discriminated three genetic
   groups: (i) a western flank in the former Yugoslavia, parts of eastern
   Austria and Hungary; (ii) an eastern flank with populations from
   Bulgaria and Romania (south of the southern Carpathians and eastern
   Carpathians); and (iii) the eastern Carpathian Basin. Hierarchical
   variance analysis distributed 53\% of the variance among populations
   between these three groups. One sample from the Greek-Bulgarian border
   clustered within the eastern flank, but showed some tendency towards the
   eastern Carpathian Basin populations. Two populations from Carinthia
   clustered together with the eastern Carpathian Basin ones and a
   population from Styria showed an intermediate genetic composition
   between the three groups. Most probably, the eastern and the western
   flank groups are due to postglacial range expansion from the
   northeastern and the northwestern edges of the glacial differentiation
   centre (so-called leading edges). The eastern Carpathian Basin group may
   have resulted from postglacial expansion from northern Greece through
   valley systems of the central Balkan peninsula, maybe even expanding
   westwards north of the Balkan mountains reaching some parts of eastern
   Austria (e.g. Carinthia). Therefore, the Balkanic refugium of M.
   galathea may or may not have been continuous along the coastal areas of
   the Mediterranean, but must have been strongly genetically structured.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of natural hybridization is highly variable and depends on
   the nonexclusive effects of both pre- and post-mating reproductive
   barriers. The objective of this study was to address three specific
   questions regarding the dynamics of hybridization between the American
   and European eels (Anguilla rostrata and Anguilla anguilla). Using 373
   AFLP loci, 1127 eels were genotyped, representing different life stages
   from both continents, as well as multiple Icelandic locations. We first
   evaluated the extent of hybridization and tested for the occurrence of
   hybrids beyond the first generation. Second, we tested whether hybrids
   were randomly distributed across continents and among Icelandic sampling
   sites. Third, we tested for a difference in the proportion of hybrids
   between glass eel and yellow eel stages in Iceland. Our results provided
   evidence for (i) an overall hybrid proportion of 15.5\% in Iceland, with
   values ranging from 6.7\% to 100\% depending on life stages and
   locations; (ii) the existence of hybrids beyond the first generation;
   (iii) a nonrandom geographic distribution of hybrids in the North
   Atlantic; and (iv) a higher proportion of first and later generation
   hybrids in yellow eels compared to glass eels, as well as a significant
   latitudinal gradient in the proportion of hybrids in Icelandic
   freshwater. We propose that the combined effect of both differential
   survival of hybrids and variation in hybridization rate through time
   best explain these patterns. We discuss the possibility that climate
   change, which is impacting many environmental features in the North
   Atlantic, may have a determinant effect on the outcome of natural
   hybridization in Atlantic eels.}},

Abstract = {{Among urodeles, ambystomatid salamanders are particularly amenable to
   genetic parentage analyses because they are explosive aggregate breeders
   that typically have large progeny arrays. Such analyses can lead to
   direct inferences about otherwise cryptic aspects of salamander natural
   history, including the rate of multiple mating, individual reproductive
   success, and the spatial distribution of clutches. In 2002, we collected
   eastern tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) egg masses (>
   1000 embryos) from a similar to 80 m linear transect in Indiana, USA.
   Embryos were genotyped at four variable microsatellite loci and the
   resulting progeny array data were used to reconstruct multilocus
   genotypes of the parental dams and sires for each egg mass. UPGMA
   analysis of genetic distances among embryos resolved four instances of
   egg mass admixture, where two or more females had oviposited at exactly
   the same site resulting in the mixing of independent cohorts. In total,
   41 discrete egg masses were available for parentage analyses.
   Twenty-three egg masses (56\%) consisted exclusively of full-siblings
   (i.e. were singly sired) and 18 (44\%) were multiply sired (mean 2.6
   males/clutch). Parentage could be genetically assigned to one of 17
   distinct parent pairs involving at least 15 females and 14 different
   males. Reproductive skew was evident among males who sired multiply
   sired clutches. Additional evidence of the effects of sexual selection
   on male reproductive success was apparent via significant positive
   correlations between male mating and reproductive success. Females
   frequently partitioned their clutches into multiple discrete egg masses
   that were separated from one another by as many as 43 m. Collectively,
   these data provide the first direct evidence for polygynandry in a wild
   population of tiger salamanders.}},

Abstract = {{Locating birthplaces using genetic parentage determination can increase
   the precision and accuracy with which animal dispersal patterns are
   established. We re-analyse patterns of movement away from the birthplace
   as a function of time, sex and population density for a sample of 303
   banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis. We located birth
   sites using a combination of likelihood-based parentage analysis with
   live-trapping of mothers during the breeding season. The results
   demonstrate that natal-breeding site distances are density dependent in
   this species; in particular, both sexes emigrate earlier in the year,
   and females disperse farther than males, at low population densities.
   Banner-tailed kangaroo rats were chosen as a study system because
   live-trapping easily detects maternal and offspring locations;
   nevertheless, parentage analysis reveals that some offspring evade early
   detection and move substantial distances before their first capture. In
   a few cases, the approach even detects dispersal out of the natal `deme'
   prior to first capture. Parentage analysis confirms the extreme
   philopatry of both sexes but indicates that prior estimates of median
   dispersal distance were too low. For D. spectabilis, more accurate
   location of individual birthplaces clarifies patterns of sex bias and
   density dependence in dispersal, and may resolve apparent discrepancies
   between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distance. For species
   in which mothers can be more reliably trapped than juveniles, using
   offspring genotypes to locate parents is a novel way that genetic
   techniques can contribute to the analysis of animal dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular studies of pinniped breeding systems exhibit a broad range of
   agreement and disagreement with observational indices of male breeding
   success. Grey seal studies have reported considerable discrepancies
   between genetic and behavioural paternity measures that have been
   interpreted as evidence of previously unidentified male strategies
   and/or tactics. Therefore, these studies have the power to fundamentally
   alter our perceptions of mating systems. However, other pinniped studies
   exhibit no such disagreements, and one possible explanation for
   disparities may be sampling biases in space and time. Therefore, it is
   essential that potential sampling biases are examined to evaluate the
   likelihood of previously unidentified male strategies. We examined
   paternities assigned at the North Rona grey seal colony between 1999 and
   2002 in relation to concurrent detailed behavioural and locational data
   for males and females. We found that (i) for females observed in sexual
   interaction(s) during their oestrus period, it was highly probable that
   one of the interacting males fathered their next pup; (ii) over 80\% of
   assigned paternities agreed with observations of the in-colony behaviour
   and spatio-temporal proximity of the males and females involved; and
   (iii) a minority of females exhibit mate choice and seek sires outside
   their local male's home range, although evidence suggests that these
   females mate on the colony rather than at sea. In conclusion, nearly all
   paternities assigned agreed with expectation based upon detailed
   knowledge of the spatio-temporal patterns of individuals during the
   breeding season. We found little evidence of unidentified male
   strategies at North Rona, Scotland, whereas further examination of
   mechanisms of female choice may be productive.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of the factors driving change in the population
   dynamics of nematodes in the soil is almost completely unknown. Top-down
   control by micro-arthropod predators may have a significant impact on
   nematode population dynamics. We report experiments showing that mites
   and Collembola were capable of reducing nematode numbers in the
   laboratory and were feeding on a targeted nematode species in the field.
   A PCR-based approach was developed for the detection of predation on
   three species of slug- and insect-pathogenic nematodes: Phasmarhabditis
   hermaphrodita, Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema feltiae. The
   collembolan Folsomia candida and the mesostigmatid mite Stratiolaelaps
   miles were employed as model predators to calibrate post-ingestion prey
   DNA detection times. Fragments of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA were
   sequenced and species-specific primers were designed, amplifying 154-,
   154- and 203-bp fragments for each of the nematode species. Detection
   times for nematode DNA within the guts of Collembola were longer than in
   mites, with half-lives (50\% of samples testing positive) of 08.75 h and
   05.03 h, respectively. F. candida significantly reduced numbers of the
   nematode H. megidis, with rates of predation of similar to 0.4 nematode
   infective juveniles per collembolan per hour over 10 h. Four taxa of
   field-caught micro-arthropod that had been exposed to the nematode P.
   hermaphrodita for a period of 12 h were analysed and significant numbers
   of three taxa tested positive. This is the first application of PCR
   techniques for the study of nematophagy and the first time these

Abstract = {{Low genetic heterozygosity is associated with loss of fitness in many
   natural populations. However, it remains unclear whether the mechanism
   is related to general (i.e. inbreeding) or local effects, in particular
   from a subset of loci lying close to genes under balancing selection.
   Here we analyse involving heterozygosity-fitness correlations on
   neonatal survival of California sea lions and on susceptibility to
   hookworm (Uncinaria spp.) infection, the single most important cause of
   pup mortality. We show that regardless of differences in hookworm
   burden, homozygosity is a key predictor of hookworm-related lesions,
   with no single locus contributing disproportionately. Conversely, the
   subsequent occurrence of anaemia due to blood loss in infected pups is
   overwhelmingly associated with homozygosity at one particular locus, all
   other loci showing no pattern. Our results suggest contrasting genetic
   mechanisms underlying two pathologies related to the same pathogen.
   First, relatively inbred pups are less able to expel hookworms and
   prevent their attachment to the intestinal mucosa, possibly due to a
   weakened immune response. In contrast, infected pups that are homozygous
   for a gene near to microsatellite Hg4.2 are strongly predisposed to
   anaemia. As yet, this gene is unknown, but could plausibly be involved
   in the blood-coagulation cascade. Taken together, these results suggest
   that pathogenic burden alone may not be the main factor regulating
   pathogen-related mortality in natural populations. Our study could have
   important implications for the conservation of small, isolated or
   threatened populations, particularly when they are at a risk of facing
   pathogenic challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones are commonly studied to dissect the processes that drive
   divergence among lineages, which have incomplete barriers of
   reproduction. Most hybrid zones have existed for an extended time making
   inferences on the initial mode of formation difficult. It is a priori
   unclear how fast a nascent hybrid zone would form as a response to
   endogenous and exogenous factors. We have studied several hybrid zones
   between two lineages of sculpins (Cottus spp.), which emerged due to a
   recent range expansion of one of the lineages along the river Rhine in
   the early 1990s. Applying a dense sampling across two contact areas and
   using a highly informative set of 45 microsatellite markers we found
   pronounced genetic structure. Steep genetic clines suggest that strong
   selective forces have shaped the respective hybrid zones from the
   beginning. We find that the zones are coupled to ecological transitions
   from small streams to larger rivers. The width of these zones is much
   smaller than estimates of annual individual dispersal distances, as
   estimated outside of the hybrid zones. The pattern is apparently not
   strongly affected by pre- or postzygotic reproductive isolation because
   numerous backcross hybrids occur within the zones. This suggests that
   strong natural selection acts against immigrant genotypes. The study
   exemplifies how local adaptation can play a key role in preventing
   admixture in dependence of the ecological context.}},

Abstract = {{Published studies of wild vertebrate populations have almost universally
   reported positive associations between genetic variation measured at
   microsatellite loci and fitness, creating the impression of ubiquity
   both in terms of the species and the traits involved. However, there is
   concern that this picture may be misleading because negative results
   frequently go unpublished. Here, we analyse the relationship between
   genotypic variation at nine highly variable microsatellite loci and
   neonatal fitness in 1070 Antarctic fur seal pups born at Bird Island,
   South Georgia. Despite our relatively large sample size, we find no
   significant association between three different measures of
   heterozygosity and two fitness traits, birth weight and survival.
   Furthermore, increasing genetic resolution by calculating parental
   relatedness also yields no association between genetic variation and
   fitness. Our findings are consistent with necropsy data showing that
   most pups die from starvation or trauma, conditions that are unlikely to
   be influenced strongly by genetic factors, particularly if the benefits
   of high heterozygosity are linked to immune-related genes.}},

Abstract = {{We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological
   paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary
   paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are
   truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might
   be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to
   be considered `populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate
   (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the
   evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying
   analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model.
   Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation
   (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each
   of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was
   very high (similar to 100\%; P < 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm =
   25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population
   assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a
   multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of
   Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving
   S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted
   gene flow below a certain level X (H(0): Nm < X) can also be high,
   provided that true Nm <= 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test
   criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters
   that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that
   cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected
   the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low
   gene flow (Nm <= 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of
   loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus
   contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high
   power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but
   requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm
   remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the
   transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a
   region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little
   power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in
   computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Native to North America, ruddy ducks Oxyura jamaicensis now occur in 21
   countries in the western Palaearctic (including Iceland) and their
   expanding population threatens the native white-headed duck, Oxyura
   leucocephala, through hybridization and possibly competition for food
   and nest sites. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear
   microsatellites to test whether the European ruddy duck population is
   descended solely from the captive population in the UK, which traces to
   seven individuals imported from the USA in 1948, or, alternatively, has
   been augmented by natural dispersal of birds from North America. Limited
   genetic diversity in the European population is consistent with a
   founder population as small as seven birds. In addition, shifts in
   allele frequencies at several loci, presumably due to genetic drift in
   the founding population, result in significant differentiation between
   the European and North American populations. Despite the recent
   separation of these populations, almost all individuals could be
   unambiguously assigned based on their composite genotypes, to one of two
   distinct populations, one comprising all of the European ruddy ducks we
   sampled (including those from Iceland and captive birds in the UK) and
   the other comprising all North American samples. Our results confirm
   that the European ruddy duck population is likely to derive solely from
   the captive population in the UK and we find no evidence of recent
   arrivals from North America or of admixture between ruddy ducks from
   Europe and North America.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that the impact of gene flow on the genetic structure of
   populations in patchy habitats depends on its scale and the demographic
   attributes of demes (e.g. local colony sizes and timing of
   reproduction), but empirical evidence is scarce. We inferred the impact
   of gene flow on genetic structure among populations of water voles
   Arvicola terrestris that differed in average colony sizes, population
   turnover and degree of patchiness. Colonies typically consisted of few
   reproducing adults and several juveniles. Twelve polymorphic
   microsatellite DNA loci were examined. Levels of individual genetic
   variability in all areas were high (H-O= 0.69-0.78). Assignments of
   juveniles to parents revealed frequent dispersal over long distances.
   The populations showed negative F-IS values among juveniles, F-IS values
   around zero among adults, high F-ST values among colonies for juveniles,
   and moderate, often insignificant, F-ST values for parents. We inferred
   that excess heterozygosity within colonies reflected the few individuals
   dispersing from a large area to form discrete breeding colonies. Thus
   pre-breeding dispersal followed by rapid reproduction results in a
   seasonal increase in differentiation due to local family groups. Genetic
   variation was as high in low-density populations in patchy habitats as
   in populations in continuous habitats used for comparison. In contrast
   to most theoretical predictions, we found that populations living in
   patchy habitats can maintain high levels of genetic variability when
   only a few adults contribute to breeding in each colony, when the
   variance of reproductive success among colonies is likely to be low, and
   when dispersal between colonies exceeds nearest-neighbour distances.}},

Abstract = {{Domestication occurs as humans select and cultivate wild plants in
   agricultural habitats. The amount and structure of variation in
   contemporary cultivated populations has been shaped, in part, by how
   genetic material was transferred from one cultivated generation to the
   next. In some cultivated tree species, domestication involved a shift
   from sexually reproducing wild populations to vegetatively propagated
   cultivated populations; however, little is known about how domestication
   has impacted variation in these species. We employed AFLP data to
   explore the amount, structure, and distribution of variation in clonally
   propagated domesticated populations and sexually reproducing wild
   populations of the Neotropical fruit tree, Spondias purpurea
   (Anacardiaceae). Cultivated populations from three different
   agricultural habitats were included: living fences, backyards, and
   orchards. AFLP data were analysed using measures of genetic diversity
   (\% polymorphic loci, Shannon's diversity index, Nei's gene diversity,
   panmictic heterozygosity), population structure (F-ST analogues), and
   principal components analyses. Levels of genetic variation in cultivated
   S. purpurea populations are significantly less than variation found in
   wild populations, although the amount of diversity varies in different
   agricultural habitats. Cultivated populations have a greater proportion
   of their genetic variability distributed among populations than wild
   populations. The genetic structure of backyard populations resembles
   that of wild populations, but living fence and orchard populations have
   1/3 more variability distributed among populations, most likely a
   reflection of relative levels of vegetative reproduction. Finally, these
   results suggest that S. purpurea was domesticated in two distinct
   regions within Mesoamerica.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities continue to cause massive fragmentation and
   reduction of forest area worldwide. With fragmentation and reduction of
   habitat recognized as the greatest threats to biodiversity, the
   implementation of improved, informed and conservation-based forestry
   practices is essential, and requires a greater understanding of the
   responses of different organisms to forest fragmentation. While genetic
   techniques can add invaluable insights to fragmentation studies they
   have rarely been employed, particularly for multiple species. In the
   present study, we combined genetic information, obtained from allozyme
   loci and anonymous single copy nuclear DNA markers, with ecological data
   to investigate the impacts of forest fragmentation on two log-dwelling
   beetles with different life histories, in an `islands of bush in a sea
   of pine' model, at Tumut in New South Wales, Australia. Both the
   relatively mobile (i.e. has high dispersal ability and/or broad habitat
   range) Adelium calosomoides and the less mobile Apasis puncticeps showed
   reduced mobility and gene flow in fragmented compared to continuous
   forest: there was significantly greater isolation by distance and
   stronger local structure revealed by spatial autocorrelation in
   fragmented forest. Analysis of patch and species characteristics
   revealed that genetic and demographic structure may be influenced by log
   degradation class for both species, and number of potential dispersal
   barriers, distance from continuous forest and desiccation
   intolerance/moisture preference for Ap. puncticeps. Thus the pine
   plantation matrix poses a barrier or filter for gene flow and mobility
   in both beetle species.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of 12 polymorphic simple sequence repeats identified in the
   genome sequence of Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of `sudden oak
   death', revealed genotypic diversity to be significantly higher in
   nurseries (91\% of total) than in forests (18\% of total). Our analysis
   identified only two closely related genotypes in US forests, while the
   genetic structure of populations from European nurseries was of
   intermediate complexity, including multiple, closely related genotypes.
   Multilocus analysis determined populations in US forests reproduce
   clonally and are likely descendants of a single introduced individual.
   The 151 isolates analysed clustered in three clades. US forest and
   European nursery isolates clustered into two distinct clades, while one
   isolate from a US nursery belonged to a third novel clade. The combined
   microsatellite, sequencing and morphological analyses suggest the three
   clades represent distinct evolutionary lineages. All three clades were
   identified in some US nurseries, emphasizing the role of commercial
   plant trade in the movement of this pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a large-scale population structure was investigated in
   Arabidopsis thaliana by studying patterns of polymorphism in a set of 71
   European accessions. We used sequence polymorphism surveyed in 10
   fragments of similar to 600 nucleotides and a set of nine microsatellite
   markers. Population structure was investigated using a model-based
   inference framework. Among the accessions studied, the presence of four
   groups was inferred using genetic data, without using prior information
   on the geographical origin of the accessions. Significant genetic
   isolation by geographical distance was detected at the group level,
   together with a geographical gradient in allelic richness across groups.
   These results are discussed with respect to the previously proposed
   scenario of postglacial colonization of Europe from putative glacial
   refugia. Finally, the contribution of the inferred structure to linkage
   disequilibrium among 171 pairs of essentially unlinked markers was also
   investigated. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that significant
   associations detected in the whole sample were mainly due to genetic
   differentiation among the inferred groups. We discuss the implication of
   this finding for future association studies in A. thaliana.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the population genetic structure of the three-spined
   stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, variability at 18 microsatellite
   loci was examined in 1724 individuals from 74 locations covering most of
   the species distribution range in Europe. The results revealed high
   overall degree of differentiation (F-ST = 0.21) but contrasting level of
   divergence and genetic variability between habitat types. Marine
   populations were genetically relatively uniform even across great
   geographical distances as compared to substantial differentiation among
   freshwater populations. Analysis of molecular variance indicated low but
   significant (2.7\%) variation in allele frequencies between geographical
   regions, but a negligible effect of habitat type (0.2\%). The
   phylogenetic pattern was not explained by habitat type, but a weak
   signal of populations clustering according to geographical or water
   system origin was found. The results support the view that three-spined
   stickleback marine ancestors colonized northern European fresh waters
   during the postglacial marine submergence c. 10 000 years ago, whereas
   in the Mediterranean region colonization probably dates back to the
   Pleistocene. The independent origins of river and lake populations
   indicate that they originate from multiple colonizations rather than
   sharing common ancestry. In the continuous marine environment, the low
   degree of differentiation among populations can be explained by gene
   flow among subpopulations and large effective population size buffering
   divergence in neutral markers. In contrast, among postglacially
   established freshwater populations differentiation appears to be driven
   by genetic drift and isolation. The stepwise mutations appear to have
   contributed to the population differentiation in the southern part of
   the three-spined stickleback distribution range.}},

   subpopulation was composed of possible introgressed individuals, two
   subpopulations were composed of seed recruits and their descendants, and
   the fourth subpopulation consisted of reintroduced individuals, seed
   recruits and their descendants. Positive spatial genetic structures were
   detected by spatial autocorrelation statistics at the population (c. 63
   m) and subpopulation levels (11-30 m), but the degree of autocorrelation
   was stronger at the population level. These results showed that

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity and fine-scale population structure in the
   lichen-forming ascomycete Xanthoria parietina was investigated using
   sequence variation in part of the intergenic spacer (IGS) and the
   complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear
   ribosomal DNA. Sampling included 213 and 225 individuals, respectively,
   from seven populations in two different habitats, bark and rock, on the
   island Storfosna off the central west coast of Norway. Both markers
   revealed significant variation and a total of 10 IGS and 16 ITS
   haplotypes were found. There were no signs of significant positive
   spatial autocorrelation at any spatial size class down to 10\% of
   transect length, nor did we find significant deviations from neutrality
   or signs of historical population expansion. Analysis of molecular
   variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variance observed
   was within populations, but when populations were grouped according to
   habitat, more than a quarter of the variance was explained among groups.
   Pairwise comparisons of populations (F-ST, exact tests of population
   differentiation) revealed significant differentiation between
   populations in different habitats (on bark or rock), but not between
   populations in the same habitat. Haplotype networks show that internal
   and presumably old haplotypes are shared between habitats, whereas
   terminal haplotypes tend to be unique to a habitat, mostly bark. We
   interpret the observed pattern to mean that there is no evidence of
   restricted gene flow between populations in the same habitat at the
   present spatial scale (interpopulation distances one or a few
   kilometres). On the other hand, differentiation between habitats is
   considerable, which we attribute to restricted gene flow between
   habitats (habitat isolation). Evidence suggests that the observed
   differentiation did not evolve locally. Estimates of divergence time
   between populations in the respective habitats indicate that an
   ancestral population started to diverge at least 34 000 years ago but
   probably much further back in time.}},

Abstract = {{The Finnish wolf population (Canis lupus) was sampled during three
   different periods (1996-1998, 1999-2001 and 2002-2004), and 118
   individuals were genotyped with 10 microsatellite markers. Large genetic
   variation was found in the population despite a recent demographic
   bottleneck. No spatial population subdivision was found even though a
   significant negative relationship between genetic relatedness and
   geographic distance suggested isolation by distance. Very few
   individuals did not belong to the local wolf population as determined by
   assignment analyses, suggesting a low level of immigration in the
   population. We used the temporal approach and several statistical
   methods to estimate the variance effective size of the population. All
   methods gave similar estimates of effective population size,
   approximately 40 wolves. These estimates were slightly larger than the
   estimated census size of breeding individuals. A Bayesian model based on
   Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations indicated strong evidence for a
   long-term population decline. These results suggest that the
   contemporary wolf population size is roughly 8\% of its historical size,
   and that the population decline dates back to late 19th century or early
   20th century. Despite an increase of over 50\% in the census size of the
   population during the whole study period, there was only weak evidence
   that the effective population size during the last period was higher
   than during the first. This may be caused by increased inbreeding,
   diminished dispersal within the population, and decreased immigration to
   the population during the last study period.}},

Abstract = {{The species of the common shrew (Sorex araneus) group are
   morphologically very similar but exhibit high levels of karyotypic
   variation. Here we used genetic variation at 10 microsatellite markers
   in a data set of 212 individuals mostly sampled in the western Alps and
   composed of five karyotypic taxa (Sorex coronatus, Sorex antinorii and
   the S. araneus chromosome races Cordon, Bretolet and Vaud) to
   investigate the concordance between genetic and karyotypic structure.
   Bayesian analysis confirmed the taxonomic status of the three sampled
   species since individuals consistently grouped according to their
   taxonomical status. However, introgression can still be detected between
   S. antinorii and the race Cordon of S. araneus. This observation is
   consistent with the expected low karyotypic complexity of hybrids
   between these two taxa. Geographically based cryptic substructure was
   discovered within S. antinorii, a pattern consistent with the different
   postglaciation recolonization routes of this species. Additionally, we
   detected two genetic groups within S. araneus notwithstanding the
   presence of three chromosome races. This pattern can be explained by the
   probable hybrid status of the Bretolet race but also suggests a
   relatively low impact of chromosomal differences on genetic structure
   compared to historical factors. Finally, we propose that the current
   data set (available at www.unil.ch/dee/page7010\_en.html\#1) could be
   used as a reference by those wanting to identify Sorex individuals
   sampled in the western Alps.}},

Abstract = {{DNA sequence polymorphism carries genealogical information and allows
   for testing hypotheses on selection and population history, especially
   through coalescent-based analysis. Understanding the evolutionary forces
   at work in plant domestication and subsequent selection is of critical
   importance for the management of genetic resources. In this study, we
   surveyed DNA sequence diversity at two assumed neutral nuclear loci in
   the wild-domesticated species complex of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). A
   high level of polymorphism was detected. The domesticated pool contains
   on average 31\% less diversity than the wild pool, but with a high
   heterogeneity among loci. Coalescent simulations of the domestication
   process showed that this result cannot be explained by assuming a
   constant population size but is rather consistent with a demographic
   bottleneck during domestication. A very low level of divergence was
   detected between the wild and the domesticated forms as well as between
   the related subspecies of the M. sativa species complex. However, the
   originality of the Spanish wild populations, already observed based on
   mitochondrial DNA polymorphism, was confirmed. These results, together
   with patterns of intrapopulation polymorphism, suggest that nuclear
   sequence polymorphism could be a promising tool, complementary to

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic studies are often focused on temperate European species
   with relict footholds in the Mediterranean region. Past climatic
   oscillations usually induced range contractions and expansions from
   refugial areas located in southern Europe, and spatial distribution of
   genetic diversity show that northward expansions were usually
   pioneer-like. Actually, few studies have focused on circum-Mediterranean
   species, which probably were not influenced in the same way by climatic
   oscillations. We present the phylogeography of the bark beetle Tomicus
   destruens, which is restricted to the whole Mediterranean basin and the
   Atlantic coasts of North Africa and Portugal. We systematically
   sequenced 617 bp of the mitochondrial genes COI and COII for 42
   populations (N = 219). Analysis revealed 53 haplotypes geographically
   structured in two clades, namely eastern and western clades, that
   diverged during the Pleistocene. A contact zone was identified along the
   Adriatic coast of Italy. Interestingly, we found contrasting levels of
   genetic structure within each clade. The eastern group was characterized
   by a significant phylogeographic pattern and low levels of gene flow,
   whereas the western group barely showed a spatial structure in haplotype
   distribution. Moreover, the main pine hosts were different between
   groups, with the Aleppo-brutia complex in the east and the maritime pine
   in the west. Potential roles of host species, climatic parameters and
   geographical barriers are discussed and the phylogeographic patterns are
   compared to classical models of postglacial recolonization in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Mantella bernhardi is an endemic species of Malagasy poison frog
   threatened by loss and fragmentation of its natural habitat and
   collection for the pet trade. It is classified as threatened according
   to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural
   Resources (IUCN) categories and included in Appendix II of the
   Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). A
   recent survey has increased the known distributional range of the
   species from one to eight populations across southeastern Madagascar,
   but little is known about its biology and genetic diversity. Here we
   estimate inter- and intrapopulation mitochondrial genetic variation of
   four populations. Populations from the northern and southern parts of
   the distributional range showed a high degree of divergence (maximum of
   11.35\% in cytochrome b) and were recovered as reciprocally monophyletic
   groups. Nine haplotypes were detected in the northern and 12 in the
   southern populations. The population from Ranomafana National Park
   showed the lowest number of haplotypes and nucleotide diversity, and
   shared its most common haplotype with the second northern population
   from Tolongoina. All the other detected haplotypes were unique to each
   of the four populations. This suggests the existence of important
   barriers to gene flow, pre-dating human colonization of Madagascar at
   about 2000 years ago, in distinct contrast to other Mantella species
   that show a high degree of haplotype sharing throughout their range. The
   continued habitat fragmentation within the distribution range of M.
   bernhardi prevents any connection between its populations. Our data
   indicate the existence of at least two different management units for
   conservation in this species, corresponding to the North and South of
   its distribution range, and highlight the existence of strong regional
   endemism in southeastern Madagascar.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effects of post-Wisconsinan glacial range expansion
   on the phylogeography of the saw-combed fishfly, Nigronia serricornis
   Say (Megaloptera: Corydalidae) because aquatic insects are
   under-represented in postglacial studies (and in phylogeography in
   general), and because the effects of ecological degradation on the
   population genetics of environmental indicator species like N.
   serricornis cannot be measured unless the underlying phylogeography is
   understood. Sequence data from a 630-base fragment of the mitochondrial
   cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene were subjected to AMOVA and nested clade
   analysis for 30 populations (n = 344) of N. serricornis. Both the AMOVA
   And nested clade analysis revealed substantial population structure;
   44.4\% of the variance occured among populations. Three northward
   migrations are apparent: one from Tennessee into Illinois, Indiana,
   Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, a second that radiated eastward from
   Pennsylvania, and a third that moved along the coast from North Carolina
   into Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and then into New York. The
   latter two of these migrations were the result of contiguous range
   expansions, while the former expansion, out of Tennessee, appears to
   have been rapid with little gene flow from the source population.
   Additional clades included a group of haplotypes in central Kentucky
   that appear to have expanded along preglacial drainages, and clades in
   North Carolina and Georgia that have remained centrally located.
   Haplotype diversity decreased from south to north, a pattern that has
   been widely reported for animal and plant populations that expanded with
   the retreat of the Wisconsinan glaciation.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how
   populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes.
   Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has
   been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A
   central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and
   potentially impedes gene flow along an east-west axis. The Formosan
   lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where
   it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population
   structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species,
   we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203
   bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide
   diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north.
   Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance,
   though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences
   between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other
   regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also
   suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary
   contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were
   used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial
   maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a
   monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together,
   our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of
   colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late
   Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow,
   probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider
   explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial
   maxima.}},

Pages = {{1657-1667}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Four major problems can affect the efficiency of methods developed to
   estimate relatedness between individuals from information of molecular
   markers: (i) some of them are dependent on the knowledge of the true
   allelic frequencies in the base population; (ii) they assume that all
   loci are unlinked and in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium; (iii)
   pairwise methods can lead to incongruous assignations because they take
   into account only two individuals at a time; (iv) most are usually
   constructed for particular structured populations (only consider a few
   relationship classes, e.g. full-sibs vs. unrelated). We have developed a
   new approach to estimate relatedness that is free from the above
   limitations. The method uses a `blind search algorithm' (actually
   simulated annealing) to find the genealogy that yield a co-ancestry
   matrix with the highest correlation with the molecular co-ancestry
   matrix calculated using the markers. Thus (i and ii) it makes no direct
   assumptions about allelic frequencies or Hardy-Weinberg and linkage
   equilibrium; (iii) it always provide congruent relationships, as it
   considers all individuals at a time; (iv) degrees of relatedness can be
   as complex as desired just increasing the `depth' (i.e. number of
   generations) of the proposed genealogies. Computer simulations have
   shown that the accuracy and robustness against genotyping errors of this
   new approach is comparable to that of other proposed methods in those
   particular situations they were developed for, but it is more flexible
   and can cope with more complex situations.}},

Abstract = {{The delimitation of population units is of primary importance in
   population management and conservation biology. Moreover, when coupled
   with landscape data, the description of population genetic structure can
   provide valuable knowledge about the permeability of landscape features,
   which is often difficult to assess by direct methods (e.g. telemetry).
   In this study, we investigated the genetic structuring of a roe deer
   population which recently recolonized a fragmented landscape. We sampled
   1148 individuals from a 40 x 55-km area containing several putative
   barriers to deer movements, and hence to gene flow, namely a highway,
   rivers and several canals. In order to assess the effect of these
   landscape features on genetic structure, we implemented a spatial
   statistical model known as GENELAND which analyses genetic structure,
   explicitly taking into account the spatial nature of the problem. Two
   genetic units were inferred, exhibiting a very low level of
   differentiation (F-ST = 0.008). The location of their boundaries
   suggested that there are no absolute barriers in this study area, but
   that the combination of several landscape features with low permeability
   can lead to population differentiation. Our analysis hence suggests that
   the landscape has a significant influence on the structuring of the
   population under study. It also illustrates the use of GENELAND as a
   powerful method to infer population structure, even in situations of
   young populations exhibiting low genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Telomeres are dynamic DNA-protein structures that form protective caps
   at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Although initial telomere length
   is partly genetically determined, subsequent accelerated telomere
   shortening has been linked to elevated levels of oxidative stress.
   Recent studies show that short telomere length alone is insufficient to
   induce cellular senescence; advanced attrition of these repetitive DNA
   sequences does, however, reflect ageing processes. Furthermore,
   telomeres vary widely in length between individuals of the same age,
   suggesting that individuals differ in their exposure or response to
   telomere-shortening stress factors. Here, we show that residual telomere
   length predicts fitness components in two phylogenetically distant bird
   species: longevity in sand martins, Riparia riparia, and lifetime
   reproductive success in dunlins, Calidris alpina. Our results therefore
   imply that individuals with longer than expected telomeres for their age

   microsatellite genetic structure in two populations occupying
   contrasting habitats. The genetic differentiation determined among
   groups of individuals using F-ST indices appeared to be weak in both
   landscapes, and showed no increase with geographical distance. Genetic
   structure investigated using pairwise genetic distances between
   individuals conversely showed a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD),
   but only in the population occurring in a homogeneous high-quality
   habitat, therefore showing the advantage of individual-based analyses in
   detecting within-population processes and local landscape effects. The
   telemetry study of juveniles revealed a leptokurtic distribution of
   dispersal distances in both populations, and estimates of the mean
   squared parent-offspring axial distance (sigma 2) inferred both from the
   genetic pattern of IBD and from the radio-tracking survey showed that
   most juveniles make little contribution to gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1970s, the nassariid gastropod Cyclope neritea has been
   extending its range north along the French Atlantic coasts from the
   Iberian Peninsula. This may be due to natural spread because of the
   recent warming of the northeastern Atlantic. However, human-mediated
   introductions related to shellfish culture may also be a probable
   explanation for this sudden range expansion. To examine these two
   hypotheses, we carried out a comprehensive study based on mitochondrial
   gene sequences (cytochrome oxidase I) of the five recently colonized
   French bays as well as 14 populations located in the recognized native
   range of the species. From a total of 594 individuals, we observed 29
   haplotypes to split into three divergent clades. In the native range, we
   observed a low molecular diversity, strong genetic structure and
   agreement between geography and gene genealogies. Along the French
   coasts, we observed the opposite: high genetic diversity and low genetic
   structure. Our results show that recurrent human-mediated introductions
   from several geographical areas in the native range may be a source for
   the French Atlantic populations. However, despite the low dispersal
   ability of C. neritea, the isolation-by-distance pattern in France
   suggested that this gastropod may have been present (although unnoticed)
   on the French Atlantic coasts before the 1970s. As C. neritea shows
   characteristics of a cryptogenic species, the classification of Atlantic
   populations as either native or introduced is not straightforward.
   Cryptogenic species should be studied further to determine the status of
   new populations close to their recognized native range.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative genetics provides a powerful framework for studying
   phenotypic evolution and the evolution of adaptive genetic variation.
   Central to the approach is G, the matrix of additive genetic variances
   and covariances. G summarizes the genetic basis of the traits and can be
   used to predict the phenotypic response to multivariate selection or to
   drift. Recent analytical and computational advances have improved both
   the power and the accessibility of the necessary multivariate
   statistics. It is now possible to study the relationships between G and
   other evolutionary parameters, such as those describing the mutational
   input, the shape and orientation of the adaptive landscape, and the
   phenotypic divergence among populations. At the same time, we are moving
   towards a greater understanding of how the genetic variation summarized
   by G evolves. Computer simulations of the evolution of G, innovations in
   matrix comparison methods, and rapid development of powerful molecular
   genetic tools have all opened the way for dissecting the interaction
   between allelic variation and evolutionary process. Here I discuss some
   current uses of G, problems with the application of these approaches,
   and identify avenues for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Sources and implications of genetic diversity in agamic complexes are
   still under debate. Population studies (amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms, microsatellites) and karyological methods (Feulgen DNA
   image densitometry and flow cytometry) were employed for
   characterization of genetic diversity and ploidy levels of 10
   populations of Ranunculus carpaticola in central Slovakia. Whereas two
   diploid populations showed high levels of genetic diversity, as expected
   for sexual reproduction, eight populations are hexaploid and harbour
   lower degrees of genotypic variation, but maintain high levels of
   heterozygosity at many loci, as is typical for apomicts. Polyploid
   populations consist either of a single AFLP genotype or of one dominant
   and a few deviating genotypes. GENOTYPE/GENODIVE and character
   incompatibility analyses suggest that genotypic variation within
   apomictic populations is caused by mutations, but in one population
   probably also by recombination. This local facultative sexuality may
   have a great impact on regional genotypic diversity. Two microsatellite
   loci discriminated genotypes separated by the accumulation of few
   mutations ('clone mates') within each AFLP clone. Genetic diversity is
   partitioned mainly among apomictic populations and is not geographically
   structured, which may be due to facultative sexuality and/or multiple
   colonizations of sites by different clones. Habitat differentiation and
   a tendency to inhabit artificial meadows is more pronounced in apomictic
   than in sexual populations. We hypothesize that maintenance of genetic
   diversity and superior colonizing abilities of apomicts in temporally
   and spatially heterogeneous environments are important for their
   distributional success.}},

Abstract = {{Lichens associated with old forest are commonly assumed to be negatively
   affected by tree logging or natural disturbances. However, in this study
   performed in a spruce-dominated sylvopastoral landscape in the Swiss
   Jura Mountains, we found that genetic diversity of the epiphytic
   old-forest lichen Lobaria pulmonaria depends on the type of disturbance.
   We collected 923 thalli from 41 sampling plots of 1 ha corresponding to
   the categories stand-replacing disturbance (burnt), intensive logging
   (logged) and uneven-aged forestry (uneven-aged), and analysed the thalli
   at six mycobiont-specific microsatellite loci. We found evidence for
   multiple independent immigrations into demes located in burnt and logged
   areas. Using spatial autocorrelation methods, the spatial scale of the
   genetic structure caused by the clonal and recombinant component of
   genetic variation was determined. Spatial autocorrelation of genotype
   diversity was strong at short distances up to 50 m in logged demes, up
   to 100 m in uneven-aged demes, with the strongest autocorrelation up to
   150 m for burnt demes. The spatial autocorrelation was predominantly
   attributed to clonal dispersal of vegetative propagules. After
   accounting for the clonal component, we did not find significant spatial
   autocorrelation in gene diversity. This pattern may indicate low
   dispersal ranges of clonal propagules, but random dispersal of sexual
   ascospores. Genetic diversity was highest in logged demes, and lowest in
   burnt demes. Our results suggest that genetic diversity of epiphytic
   lichen demes may not necessarily be impacted by stand-level disturbances
   for extended time periods.}},

Abstract = {{The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains genes integral to
   immune response in vertebrates. MHC genes have been shown to be under
   selection in a number of vertebrate taxa, making them intriguing for
   population genetic studies. We have conducted a survey of genetic
   variation in an MHC class II gene for steelhead trout from 24 sites in
   coastal California and compared this variation to that observed at 16
   presumably neutral microsatellite loci. A high amount of allelic
   variation was observed at the MHC when compared to previously published
   studies on other Pacific salmonids. Elevated nonsynonymous
   substitutions, relative to synonymous substitutions, were detected at
   the MHC gene, indicating the signature of historical balancing
   selection. The MHC data were tested for correlations to and deviations
   from the patterns found with the microsatellite data. Estimates of
   allelic richness for the MHC gene and for the microsatellites were
   positively correlated, as were estimates of population differentiation
   (F-ST). An analysis for F-ST outliers indicates that the MHC locus has
   an elevated F-ST relative to the neutral expectation, although a
   significant result was found for only one particular geographical
   subgroup. Relatively uniform allele frequency distributions were
   detected in four populations, although this finding may be partially due
   to recent population bottlenecks. These results indicate that, at the
   scale studied here, drift and migration play a major role in the
   observed geographical variability of MHC genes in steelhead, and that
   contemporary selection is relatively weak and difficult to detect.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a rare event that is difficult to observe in slowly

   study we used sex-linked (mitochondrial DNA sequence and Y-chromosome

   magnitude of difference in effective dispersal between the sexes and to
   investigate the long-term demographic history of bonobos. We sampled 34
   males from four distinct geographical areas across the bonobo
   distribution range. As predicted for a female-dispersing species, we
   found much higher levels of differentiation among local bonobo
   populations based upon Y-chromosomal than mtDNA genetic variation.
   Specifically, almost all of the Y-chromosomal variation distinguished
   populations, while nearly all of the mtDNA variation was shared between
   populations. Furthermore, genetic distance correlated with geographical
   distance for mtDNA but not for the Y chromosome. Female bonobos have a
   much higher migration rate and/or effective population size as compared
   to males, and the estimate for the mitochondrial TMRCA (time to most
   recent common ancestor) was approximately 10 times greater than the
   estimate for the Y chromosome (410000 vs. 40000-45000). For humans the

Abstract = {{Dawson's burrowing bee is a large, fast-flying solitary nesting bee
   endemic to the arid zone of Western Australia. In this study the
   population structure of the species was examined with molecular markers.
   Using eight microsatellite loci, we genotyped 531 adult female bees
   collected from 13 populations of Dawson's burrowing bee, Amegilla
   dawsoni, across the species range. The mean number of alleles per locus
   ranged from 4 to 38 and expected heterozygosity was uniformly high with
   a mean of 0.602. Pairwise comparisons of F-ST among all 13 populations
   ranged from 0.0071 to 0.0122 with only one significant estimate and an
   overall F-ST of 0.001. The entire sample collection was in
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and there was no evidence of inbreeding with
   a mean F-IS of 0.010. The mating and nesting behaviour of this bee
   suggests that gene flow would be limited by monandry and the fact that
   almost 90\% of females mate immediately on emergence. Nevertheless there
   is obviously sufficient gene flow to maintain panmixia, and we suggest
   that this results from infrequent and unreliable rainfall in the species
   range, which causes the bees to congregate at limited food resources,
   allowing a small number of unmated females from one emergence site to
   come into contact with males from another population. In addition, when
   drought eliminates food resources near an emergence site, the whole
   population may move elsewhere, increasing gene flow across the species
   range.}},

Abstract = {{The research objectives were to determine aspects of the population
   dynamics relevant to effective monitoring of gene flow in the soybean
   crop complex in Japan. Using 20 microsatellite primers, 616 individuals
   from 77 wild soybean (Glycine soja) populations were analysed. All
   samples were of small seed size (< 0.03 g), were directly collected in
   the field and came from all parts of Japan where wild soybeans grow,
   except Hokkaido. Japanese wild soybean showed significant reduction in
   observed heterozygosity, low outcrossing rate (mean 3.4\%) and strong
   genetic differentiation among populations. However, the individual
   assignment test revealed evidence of rare long-distance seed dispersal
   (> 10 km) events among populations, and spatial autocorrelation analysis
   revealed that populations within a radius of 100 km showed a close
   genetic relationship to one another. When analysis of graphical
   ordination was applied to compare the microsatellite variation of wild
   soybean with that of 53 widely grown Japanese varieties of cultivated
   soybean (Glycine max), the primary factor of genetic differentiation was
   based on differences between wild and cultivated soybeans and the
   secondary factor was geographical differentiation of wild soybean
   populations. Admixture analysis revealed that 6.8\% of individuals
   appear to show introgression from cultivated soybeans. These results
   indicated that population genetic structure of Japanese wild soybean is
   (i) strongly affected by the founder effect due to seed dispersal and
   inbreeding strategy, (ii) generally well differentiated from cultivated
   soybean, but (iii) introgression from cultivated soybean occurs. The
   implications of the results for the release of transgenic soybeans where
   wild soybeans grow are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of genetic variability at neutral marker loci is expected to
   decrease, and the degree of genetic differentiation among populations to
   increase, as a negative function of effective population size. We
   assessed the patterns of genetic variability and differentiation at
   seven microsatellite loci in the common frog (Rana temporaria) in a
   hierarchical sampling scheme involving three regions (208-885 km apart),
   three subregions within regions and nine populations (5-20 km apart)
   within subregions, and related the variability and differentiation
   estimates to variation in local population size estimates. Genetic
   variability within local populations decreased significantly with
   increasing latitude, as well as with decreasing population size and
   regional site occupancy (proportion of censured localities occupied).
   The positive relationship between population size and genetic
   variability estimates was evident also when the effect of latitude (cf.
   colonization history) was accounted for. Significant genetic
   differentiation was found at all hierarchical levels, and the degree of
   population differentiation tended to increase with increasing latitude.
   Isolation by distance was evident especially at the regional sampling
   level, and its strength increased significantly towards the north in
   concordance with decreasing census and marker-based neighbourhood size
   estimates. These results are in line with the conjecture that the
   influence of current demographic factors can override the influence of
   historical factors on species population genetic structure. Further, the
   observed reductions in genetic variability and increased degree of
   population differentiation towards the north are in line with
   theoretical and empirical treatments suggesting that effective
   population sizes decline towards the periphery of a species' range.}},

Abstract = {{Giant Amazon river turtles, Podocnemis expansa, are indigenous to the
   Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo River basins, and are distributed across
   nearly the entire width of the South American continent. Although once
   common, their large size, high fecundity, and gregarious nesting, made
   P. expansa especially vulnerable to over-harvesting for eggs and meat.
   Populations have been severely reduced or extirpated in many areas
   throughout its range, and the species is now regulated under Appendix II
   of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Here, we
   analyse data from mitochondrial DNA sequence and multiple nuclear
   microsatellite markers with an array of complementary analytical
   methods. Results show that concordance from multiple data sets and
   analyses can provide a strong signal of population genetic structure
   that can be used to guide management. The general lack of
   phylogeographic structure but large differences in allele and haplotype
   frequencies among river basins is consistent with fragmented populations
   and female natal-river homing. Overall, the DNA data show that P.
   expansa populations lack a long history of genetic differentiation, but
   that each major tributary currently forms a semi-isolated reproductive
   population and should be managed accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{The badger, Meles meles, is a widely distributed mustelid in Eurasia and
   shows large geographic variability in morphological characters whose
   evolutionary significance is unclear and needs to be contrasted with
   molecular data. We sequenced 512 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control
   region in 115 Eurasian badgers from 21 countries in order to test for
   the existence of structuring in their phylogeography, to describe the
   genetic relationships among their populations across its widespread
   geographic range, and to infer demographic and biogeographic processes.
   We found that the Eurasian badger is divided into four groups regarding
   their mitochondrial DNA: Europe, Southwest Asia, North and East Asia,
   and Japan. This result suggests that the separation of badgers into
   phylogeographic groups was influenced by cold Pleistocene glacial stages
   and permafrost boundaries in Eurasia, and by geographic barriers, such
   as mountains and deserts. Genetic variation within phylogeographic
   groups based on distances assuming the Tamura-Nei model with rate
   heterogeneity and invariable sites (d(T-N) range: 3.3-4.2) was much
   lower than among them (d(T-N) range: 10.7-38.0), and 80\% of the
   variation could be attributed to differences among regions. Spatial
   analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), median-joining network, and
   Mantel test did not detect genetic structuring within any of the
   phylogeographic groups with the exception of Europe, where 50\% of
   variation was explained by differences among groups of populations. Our
   data suggest that the European, Southwest Asian, and North and East
   Asian badgers evolved separately since the end of Pliocene, at the
   beginnings of glacial ages, whereas Japanese badgers separated from
   continental Asian badgers during the middle Pleistocene. Endangered
   badgers from Crete Island, classified as Meles meles arcalus subspecies,
   were closely related to badgers from Southwest Asia. We also detected
   sudden demographic growth in European and Southwest Asian badgers that
   occurred during the Middle Pleistocene.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, into North
   American waters has resulted in profound ecological disturbances and
   large monetary losses. This study examined the invasion history and
   patterns of genetic diversity among endemic and invading populations of
   zebra mussels using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase I (COI) gene. Patterns of haplotype frequency indicate that all
   invasive populations of zebra mussels from North America and Europe
   originated from the Ponto-Caspian Sea region. The distribution of
   haplotypes was consistent with invasive populations arising from the
   Black Sea drainage, but could not exclude the possibility of an origin
   from the Caspian Sea drainage. Similar haplotype frequencies among North
   American populations of D. polymorpha suggest colonization by a single
   founding population. There was no evidence of invasive populations
   arising from tectonic lakes in Turkey, while lakes in Greece and
   Macedonia contained only Dreissena stankovici. Populations in Turkey
   might be members of a sibling species complex of D. polymorpha.
   Ponto-Caspian derived populations of D. polymorpha (theta = 0.0011) and
   Dreissena bugensis (one haplotype) exhibited low levels of genetic
   diversity at the COI gene, perhaps as a result of repeated population
   bottlenecks. In contrast, geographically isolated tectonic lake
   populations exhibited relatively high levels of genetic diversity (theta
   = 0.0032 to 0.0134). It is possible that the fluctuating environment of
   the Ponto-Caspian basin facilitated the colonizing habit of invasive
   populations of D. polymorpha and D. bugensis. Our findings were
   concordant with the general trend of destructive freshwater invaders in
   the Great Lakes arising from the Ponto-Caspian Sea basin.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Dreissena includes two widespread and aggressive aquatic
   invaders, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and the quagga mussel,
   Dreissena bugensis. This genus evolved in the Ponto-Caspian Sea basin,
   characterized by dynamic instability over multiple timescales and a
   unique evolutionary environment that may predispose to invasiveness. The
   objectives of this study were to gain insights into the demographic
   history of Dreissena species in their endemic range, to reconstruct
   intraspecific phylogeographic relationships among populations, and to
   clarify systematics of the genus, using DNA sequences from the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. We found four deeply
   diverged clades within this genus, with a basal split that approximately
   coincided with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Divergence events
   within the four base clades were much more recent, corresponding to
   geographically disjunct sets of populations, which might represent
   species complexes. Across all taxa, populations of Dreissena shared a
   common pattern of genetic signatures indicating historical population
   bottlenecks and expansions. Haplotype diversity was relatively low in
   Ponto-Caspian drainages relative to more stable tectonic lakes in
   Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey. The phylogeographic and demographic
   patterns in the endemic range of Dreissena might have resulted from
   vicariance events, habitat instability, and the high fecundity and
   passive dispersal of these organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic studies have shed light on Pleistocene glaciations as a
   key factor in shaping present-day genetic structure of many organisms.
   In formerly glaciated regions, the combined action of several factors
   such as refuges origin, physiological capacities and demographic
   parameters have contributed importantly to this process but specifically
   for each species. Therefore, a fine-scale genetic structure is not
   expected to be similar for different species, unless it has been
   modulated by the action of a strong environmental pressure. The aim of
   this study is to investigate the effects of postglacial environment on
   the genetic structure of fishes. To achieve this objective, three fish
   species (northern pike, lake whitefish and yellow perch) commonly found
   in sympatry in Laurentian Shield lakes but displaying different
   ecological and physiological characteristics were analysed. The
   comparison of these unrelated species was performed to identify the
   factors determining the organization of their genetic structure.
   Populations of all species mostly originated from the Mississippian
   refuge. Low genetic differentiation was observed among populations but
   significant structures were detected for the three species. Despite
   marked differences among species, these structures presented common
   characteristics: a lack of congruence with drainage and a longitudinal
   organization. This suggested that the dispersion of species occurred
   independently, leading to a species-specific structure. However, the
   settling of populations appeared to be mediated by a dynamic system of
   proglacial meltwater streams associated to the glacial Lake
   Ojibway-Barlow, providing such similarities among species.}},

Abstract = {{The contemporary pattern of intraspecific genetic variation can indicate
   the relative role of gene flow and local differentiation in shaping the
   evolutionary history and future trajectory of a species. To assess the
   recent influence of contrasting life history and demographic
   characteristics on genetic structure within a group of closely related
   species, patterns of genetic differentiation (F-ST and related
   statistics) and isolation by distance (IBD) were compared among 17
   congeneric herbaceous plant species. Data came from 35 published studies
   of 16 species, and a previously unpublished analysis of chloroplast
   genetic variation in the rare endemic Silene rotundifolia.
   Among-population genetic variance was most strongly influenced by the
   type of genetic marker used; cytoplasmic markers showed larger values
   than allozyme and anonymous nuclear markers. Other independently
   significant factors were geographical range size and, for allozyme
   studies, reproductive system; in particular, endemism and
   hermaphroditism were associated with higher among-population genetic
   variance, whereas large native geographical range and dioecy were
   associated with lower among-population variance. Over equivalent spatial
   scales, dioecious populations also showed weaker IBD than
   hermaphrodites, perhaps because increased population transience and/or
   variance in the spatial pattern of gene flow are more closely associated
   with dioecy in this genus. Invasive populations had both highly variable
   among-population genetic variance, and no evidence for IBD, consistent

   valuable for synthesizing the complementary information provided by
   F-statistics and IBD, and for indicating the relative importance of
   particular biological factors in shaping genetic variation within
   different species of a closely related plant group.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread distribution of the freshwater shrimp Paratya
   australiensis in eastern Australia suggests that populations of this
   species have been connected in the past. Amphidromy is ancestral in
   these shrimps, although many extant populations are known to be
   restricted to freshwater habitats. In this study, we used a fragment of
   the cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene to examine
   diversity within P. australiensis and to assess the relative importance
   of amphidromy in its evolutionary history. We hypothesized that if
   transitions from an amphidromous to a freshwater life history were
   important, then we would find a number of divergent lineages restricted
   to single or groups of nearby drainages. Alternatively, if amphidromy
   was maintained within the species historically, we expected to find
   lineages distributed over many drainages. We assumed that the only way
   for divergence to occur within amphidromous lineages was if dispersal
   was limited to between nearby estuaries, which, during arid periods in
   the earth's history, became isolated from one another. We found nine
   highly divergent mtDNA lineages, estimated to have diverged from one
   another in the late Miocene/early Pliocene, when the climate was more
   arid than at present. Despite this, the geographic distribution of
   lineages and haplotypes within lineages did not support the notion of a
   stepping-stone model of dispersal between estuaries. We conclude that
   the extensive divergence has most likely arisen through a number of
   independent amphidromy-freshwater life history transitions, rather than
   via historical isolation of amphidromy populations. We also found
   evidence for extensive movement between coastal and inland drainages,
   supporting the notion that secondary contact between lineages may have
   occurred as a result of drainage rearrangements. Finally, our data
   indicate that P. australiensis is likely a complex of cryptic species,
   some of which are widely distributed, and others geographically
   restricted.}},

Abstract = {{It was recently recognized that in Japan, the common yellow butterfly,
   Eurema hecabe, consists of two sibling species, which have been unnamed
   yet and tentatively called yellow (Y) type and brown (B) type. We
   investigated the diversity of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in
   Japanese populations of Y type and B type of E. hecabe. The phylogeny
   based on nuclear genes agreed with the distinction between Y type and B
   type, which had been also supported by a wide array of biological data.
   However, the phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes did not reflect the
   distinction. PCR survey of Wolbachia revealed that B-type populations
   were all infected while Y-type populations contained both infected and
   uninfected individuals. A single genotype of Wolbachia, which was
   inferred to be a CI-inducing strain from their wsp gene sequence, was
   prevalent in these populations. Notably, the mitochondrial phylogeny was
   in perfect agreement with the pattern of Wolbachia infection, suggesting
   that the Wolbachia infection had affected the mitochondrial genetic
   structure of the host insects. Probably, the Wolbachia strain and the
   associated mitochondrial genomes have been occasionally introduced from
   B-type populations to Y-type populations through migration and
   subsequent interspecific hybridization, and CI-driven population sweep
   has been spreading the Wolbachia strain and the particular mitochondrial
   haplotypes, which originated from B-type populations, into Y-type
   populations. On the basis of these results together with the geological
   and biogeographical knowledge of the Japanese Archipelago, we proposed
   an evolutionary hypothesis on the invasion and spread of Wolbachia
   infection in B-type and Y-type of E. hecabe.}},

Abstract = {{The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, exhibits extensive latitudinal
   clinal variation in a number of physiological and biochemical traits,
   coupled with phylogeographical patterns at mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
   loci that suggest a complicated history of spatially variable selection
   and secondary intergradation. This species continues to serve as a model
   for understanding local and regional adaptation to variable
   environments. Resolving the influences of historical processes on the
   distribution of genetic variation within and among extant populations of
   F. heteroclitus is crucial to a better understanding of how populations
   evolve in the context of contemporary environments. In this study, we
   analysed geographical patterns of genetic variation at eight
   microsatellite loci among 15 populations of F. heteroclitus distributed
   throughout the North American range of the species from Nova Scotia to
   Georgia. Genetic variation in Northern populations was lower than in
   Southern populations and was strongly correlated with latitude
   throughout the species range. The most common Northern alleles at all
   eight loci exhibited concordant latitudinal clinal patterns, and the
   existence of an abrupt transition zone in allele frequencies between
   Northern and Southern populations was similar to that observed for
   mitochondrial DNA and allozyme loci. A significant pattern of isolation
   by distance was observed both within and between northern and southern
   regions. This pattern was unexpected, particularly for northern
   populations, given the recent colonization history of post-Pleistocene
   habitats, and was inconsistent with either a recent northward population
   expansion or a geographically restricted northern Pleistocene refugium.
   The data provided no evidence for recent population bottlenecks, and
   estimates of historical effective population sizes suggest that
   post-Pleistocene populations have been large throughout the species
   distribution. These results suggest that F. heteroclitus was broadly
   distributed throughout most of its current range during the last glacial
   event and that the abrupt transition in allele frequencies that separate
   Northern and Southern populations may reflect regional disequilibrium
   conditions associated with the post-Pleistocene colonization history of
   habitats in that region.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial genetic variation within species is influenced by both
   contemporary and historical factors. We attempted to assess the impact
   of increased aridity and lower temperatures associated with the last
   glacial maximum on possible refugia and the structuring of genetic
   variation in Banksia hookeriana, a shrub species restricted to deep
   sands on the Eneabba sandplain and adjacent Gingin Scarp/Dandaragan
   Plateau, centred 300 km north of Perth, Western Australia. We used
   optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to estimate the last time
   these sands were mobile, as well as amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms (AFLP) to infer spatial patterns and the phylogeographical
   history of genetic variation among 15 populations of B. hookeriana.
   While genetic variation at the species level was high, with 96.6\% of
   238 AFLP markers polymorphic, average within population gene diversity
   was low (H-pop = 0.16). Of the total genetic variation, an analysis of
   molecular variance (AMOVA) partitioned 70\% within populations, 24\%
   among populations within substrate and 6\% between substrates. There was
   an isolation-by-distance effect among populations within the same
   substrate, but not across substrates, and ordination highlighted genetic
   differentiation between the sandplain and scarp/plateau populations. A
   neighbour-joining tree identified the sandplain populations as a
   distinct clade, with the exception of the most northern sandplain
   population, which clustered with two northern and eastern plateau
   populations. The most southern plateau populations formed a clade sister
   to the sandplain clade. OSL dating of sand at six extant populations
   suggested that dunes were last mobile 15000-35000 years ago, with no
   clear difference in the ages of sandplain and plateau dunes. These data
   are consistent with a historical scenario of (re) colonization from
   isolated refugia of smaller populations either within the patchily
   vegetated sandplain and/or refugia at the northern, eastern and southern
   sandplain/scarp margins following postglacial climate amelioration and
   dune stabilization. Historic interpretations were confounded by the
   possible effects of long-distance dispersal, natural selection by
   substrate, and weak and/or ancient introgression with the sister
   species, Banksia prionotes.}},

Abstract = {{According to kin selection theory, the location of an individual with
   respect to its relatives can have important ramifications for its
   fitness. Perhaps more than any other vertebrate group, anuran amphibian
   larvae have been the subject of many experiments on this topic. Some
   anuran species have been shown in the laboratory to recognize and
   associate with their siblings and half-siblings. However, due to the
   difficulty of identifying sibships, no kinship studies with anuran
   larvae have been conducted in the wild. Here, we use microsatellite
   analysis to show that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles were
   nonrandomly distributed in two ponds with respect to their relatives. In
   one pond, the tadpoles were significantly clumped with their siblings or
   half-siblings as expected from other published laboratory studies on
   this species. However, in another pond, the tadpoles were significantly
   nonrandomly dispersed from their siblings or half-siblings. This is the
   first example of kin repulsion of nonreproductive animals in the wild
   and the first time a species has been shown to display both aggregation
   and repulsion under different circumstances. These results suggest that
   kin distribution is context dependent and demonstrate the importance of

   ability to produce haploid eggs that can develop into viable male

   we present microsatellite data for 176 males from eight colonies of the

   genotypes and inferred queen genotypes from the same colonies show that
   workers do not or at best very rarely reproduce in the presence of the
   queen. Queens of D. (A.) molestus are known to be highly multiply mated.
   This implies that workers are on average more closely related to queen
   sons than to other workers' sons, so that our results are consistent
   with predictions from inclusive fitness theory. It remains unknown,
   however, whether worker sterility is maintained by active worker
   policing or by self-restraint.}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been studied
   for several decades because of their pronounced allelic polymorphism.
   Structural allelic polymorphism is, however, not the only source of
   variability subjected to natural selection. Genetic variation may also
   exist in gene expression patterns. Here, we show that in a natural
   population of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the
   expression of MHC class IIB genes was positively correlated with
   parasite load, which indicates increased immune activation of the MHC
   when infections are frequent. To experimentally study MHC expression, we
   used laboratory-bred sticklebacks that were exposed to three naturally
   occurring species of parasite. We found strong differences in MHC class
   IIB expression patterns among fish families, which were consistent over
   two generations, thus demonstrating a genetic component. The average
   number of MHC class IIB sequence variants within families was negatively
   correlated to the MHC expression level suggesting compensatory
   up-regulation in fish with a low (i.e. suboptimal) MHC sequence
   variability. The observed differences among families and the negative
   correlation with individual sequence diversity imply that MHC expression
   is evolutionary relevant for the onset and control of the immune

Abstract = {{In alpine ecosystems, microscale variation in snowmelt timing often
   causes different flowering phenology of the same plant species and
   seasonal changes in pollinator activity. We compared the variations in
   insect visitation, pollen dispersal, mating patterns, and sexual
   reproduction of Rhododendron aureum early and late in the flowering
   season using five microsatellites. Insects visiting the flowers were
   rare early in the flowering season (mid-June), when major pollinators
   were bumblebee queens and flies. In contrast, frequent visitations by
   bumblebee workers were observed late in the season (late July).
   Two-generation analysis of pollen pool structure demonstrated that
   quality of pollen-mediated gene flow was more diverse late in the season
   in parallel with the high pollinator activity. The effective number of
   pollen donors per fruit (N-ep) increased late in the season (N-ep =
   2.2-2.7 early, 3.4-4.4 late). However, both the outcrossing rate (t(m))
   and seed-set ratio per fruit were smaller late in the season (t(m) =
   0.89 and 0.71, seed-set ratio = 0.52 and 0.18, early and late in the
   season, respectively). In addition, biparental inbreeding occurred only
   late in the season. We conclude that R. aureum shows contrasting
   patterns of pollen movement and seed production between early and late
   season: in early season, seed production can be high but genetically
   less diverse and, during late season, be reduced, possibly due to higher
   inbreeding and inbreeding depression, but have greater genetic
   diversity. Thus, more pollinator activity does not always mean more
   pollen movement.}},

Abstract = {{Heritable variation in regulatory or coding regions is the raw material
   for evolutionary processes. The advent of microarrays has recently
   promoted examination of the extent of variation in gene expression
   within and among taxa and examination of the evolutionary processes
   affecting variation. This review examines these issues. We find: (i)
   microarray-based measures of gene expression are precise given
   appropriate experimental design; (ii) there is large inter-individual
   variation, which is composed of a minor nongenetic component and a large
   heritable component; (iii) variation among populations and species
   appears to be affected primarily by neutral drift and stabilizing
   selection, and to a lesser degree by directional selection; and (iv)
   neutral evolutionary divergence in gene expression becomes nonlinear
   with greater divergence times due to functional constraint. Evolutionary
   analyses of gene expression reviewed here provide unique insights into
   partitioning of regulatory variation in nature. However, common
   limitations of these studies include the tendency to assume a linear
   relationship between expression divergence and species divergence, and
   failure to test explicit hypotheses that involve the ecological context
   of evolutionary divergence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the creation of a cDNA microarray for annual
   sunflowers and its use to elucidate patterns of gene expression in
   Helianthus annuus, Helianthus petiolaris, and the homoploid hybrid
   species Helianthus deserticola. The array comprises 3743 ESTs (expressed
   sequence tags) representing approximately 2897 unique genes. It has an
   average clone/EST identity rate of 91\%, is applicable across species
   boundaries within the annual sunflowers, and shows patterns of gene
   expression that are highly reproducible according to real-time RT-PCR
   (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) results. Overall,
   12.8\% of genes on the array showed statistically significant
   differential expression across the three species. Helianthus deserticola
   displayed transgressive, or extreme, expression for 58 genes, with
   roughly equal numbers exhibiting up- or down-regulation relative to both
   parental species. Transport-related proteins were strongly
   over-represented among the transgressively expressed genes, which makes
   functional sense given the extreme desert floor habitat of H.
   deserticola. The potential adaptive value of differential gene
   expression was evaluated for five genes in two populations of early
   generation (BC2) hybrids between the parental species grown in the H.
   deserticola habitat. One gene (a G protein-coupled receptor) had a
   significant association with fitness and maps close to a QTL controlling
   traits that may be adaptive in the desert habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the physiological basis of local adaptation to drought in
   Boechera holboellii, a perennial relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
   used cDNA-AFLPs to identify candidate genes showing differential
   expression in these populations. We compared two populations of B.
   holboellii from contrasting water environments in a reciprocal
   transplant experiment, as well as in a laboratory dry-down experiment.
   We continuously measured the water content of soils using time domain
   reflectometery (TDR). We compared populations for their water use
   efficiency (WUE), root/shoot ratios (R:S) and leaf mass per unit area
   (LMA) in the field and in the laboratory, and identified candidate genes
   that (i) responded plastically to water stress and (ii) were
   differentially expressed between the two populations. Genotypes from the
   drier site had higher WUE, which was attributable to a large reduction
   in transpirational water loss. The xeric-adapted population also had
   increased investment in root biomass and greater leaf mass per unit
   area. Reciprocal transplants in the field had significantly greater
   survival in their native habitat. In total, 450 cDNA-AFLP fragments
   showed significant changes between drought and control treatments.
   Furthermore, some genes showed genotype (population)-specific patterns
   of up- or down-regulation in response to drought. Three hundred
   cDNA-AFLP bands were sequenced leading to the identification of cDNAs
   coding for proteins involved in signal transduction, transcriptional
   regulation, redox regulation, oxidative stress and pathways involved in
   stress adaptation. Some of these proteins could contribute a
   physiological advantage under drought, making them potential targets for

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that phenotypic parallelism between dwarf and
   normal whitefish ecotypes (Coregonus clupeaformis, Salmonidae) is
   accompanied by parallelism in gene transcription. The most striking
   phenotypic differences between these forms implied energetic metabolism
   and swimming activity. Therefore, we predicted that genes showing
   parallel expression should mainly belong to functional groups associated
   with these phenotypes. Transcriptome profiles were obtained from white
   muscle by using a 3557 cDNA gene microarray developed for the Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar). A total of 1181 genes expressed in both lake
   populations hybridized on the array. Significant differential expression
   between ecotypes was detected for 134 (11.3\%) and 195 (16.5\%) gene
   clones in Cliff Lake and Indian Pond, respectively. Fifty-one genes
   (4.3\%) showed parallel differential expression between lakes, among
   which 35 were expressed in opposite directions. Sixteen genes (1.35\%)
   showed true parallelism of transcription, which mainly belonged to
   energetic metabolism and regulation of muscle contraction functional
   groups. Variance in expression was significantly reduced for these genes
   compared to those not showing directionality in parallelism of
   expression. Candidate genes associated with parallelism in swimming
   activity and energetic metabolism based on their level and variance in
   expression were identified. These results add to the growing evidence
   that parallel phenotypic evolution also involves parallelism at both the
   genotypic and regulatory level, which may at least partly be associated
   with genetic constraints. It also provides further evidence for the
   determinant role of divergent natural selection in driving phenotypic
   divergence, and perhaps reproductive isolation, in the adaptive
   radiation of lake whitefish. This study adds to a nascent field
   employing microarrays as powerful tools for investigating the
   evolutionary processes of adaptive divergence among natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{In many animal groups, mutualistic bacterial symbionts play a central
   role in host ecology, by provisioning rare nutrients and thus enabling
   specialization on restricted diets. Among such symbionts, genomic
   studies are most advanced for Buchnera, the obligate symbiont of aphids,
   which feed on phloem sap. The contents of the highly reduced Buchnera
   genomes have verified its role in aphid nutrition. Comparisons of
   Buchnera gene sets indicate ongoing, irreversible gene losses that are
   expected to affect aphid nutritional needs. Furthermore, almost all
   regulatory genes have been eliminated, raising the question of whether
   and how gene expression responds to environmental change. Microarray
   studies on genome-wide expression indicate that Buchnera has evolved
   some constitutive changes in gene expression: homologues of heat stress
   genes have elevated transcript levels in Buchnera (relative to other
   bacteria) even in the absence of stress. Additionally, the microarray
   results indicate that responses to heat stress and to amino acid
   availability are both few and modest. Observed responses are consistent
   with control by the few ancestral regulators retained in the genome.
   Initial studies on the role of host genes in mediating the symbiosis
   reveal distinctive expression patterns in host cells harbouring
   Buchnera. In the near future, a complete genome of pea aphid will
   accelerate progress in understanding the functional integration of aphid
   and Buchnera genomes. Although information for other insect symbioses is
   relatively limited, studies on symbionts of carpenter ants and tsetse
   flies indicate many similarities to Buchnera.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994, the bacterial parasite Mycoplasma gallisepticum expanded its
   host range and swept through populations of a novel host - eastern US
   populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). This epizootic
   caused a dramatic decline in finch population numbers, has been shown to
   have caused strong selection on house finch morphology, and presumably
   caused evolutionary change at the molecular level as finches evolved
   enhanced resistance. As a first step toward identifying finch genes that
   respond to infection by Mycoplasma and which may have experienced
   natural selection by this parasite, we used suppression subtractive
   hybridization (SSH) and cDNA macroarray approaches to identify
   differentially expressed genes regulated by the Mycoplasma parasite. Two
   subtractive cDNA libraries consisting of 16 512 clones were developed
   from spleen using an experimentally uninfected bird as the `tester' and
   an infected bird as `driver', and vice versa. Two hundred and twenty
   cDNA clones corresponding 34 genes with known vertebrate homologues and
   a large number of novel transcripts were found to be qualitatively up-
   or down-regulated genes by high-density filter hybridization. These gene
   expression changes were further confirmed by a high throughout reverse
   Northern blot approach and in specific cases by targeted Northern
   analysis. BLAST searches show that heat shock protein (HSP) 90, MHC
   II-associated invariant chain (CD74), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 1
   (TIM1), as well as numerous novel expressed genes not found in the
   databases were up- or down-regulated by the host in response to this
   parasite. Our results and macroarray resources provide a foundation for
   molecular co-evolutionary studies of the Mycoplasma parasite and its
   recently colonized avian host.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a genomics strategy to characterize inducible defences
   against insect herbivory in poplar, we developed a comprehensive suite
   of functional genomics resources including cDNA libraries, expressed
   sequence tags (ESTs) and a cDNA microarray platform. These resources are
   designed to complement the existing poplar genome sequence and poplar
   (Populus spp.) ESTs by focusing on herbivore- and elicitor-treated
   tissues and incorporating normalization methods to capture rare
   transcripts. From a set of 15 standard, normalized or full-length cDNA
   libraries, we generated 139 007 3'- or 5'-end sequenced ESTs,
   representing more than one-third of the c. 385 000 publicly available
   Populus ESTs. Clustering and assembly of 107 519 3'-end ESTs resulted in
   14 451 contigs and 20 560 singletons, altogether representing 35 011
   putative unique transcripts, or potentially more than three-quarters of
   the predicted c. 45 000 genes in the poplar genome. Using this EST
   resource, we developed a cDNA microarray containing 15 496 unique genes,
   which was utilized to monitor gene expression in poplar leaves in
   response to herbivory by forest tent caterpillars (Malacosoma disstria).
   After 24 h of feeding, 1191 genes were classified as up-regulated,
   compared to only 537 down-regulated. Functional classification of this
   induced gene set revealed genes with roles in plant defence (e.g.
   endochitinases, Kunitz protease inhibitors), octadecanoid and ethylene
   signalling (e.g. lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase,
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase), transport (e.g. ABC
   proteins, calreticulin), secondary metabolism {[}e.g. polyphenol
   oxidase, isoflavone reductase, (-)-germacrene D synthase] and
   transcriptional regulation {[}e.g. leucine-rich repeat transmembrane
   kinase, several transcription factor classes (zinc finger C3H type,
   AP2/EREBP, WRKY, bHLH)]. This study provides the first genome-scale
   approach to characterize insect-induced defences in a woody perennial
   providing a solid platform for functional investigation of plant-insect
   interactions in poplar.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed recombinant inbred lines of a cross between naturally
   occurring ecotypes of Avena barbata (Pott ex Link), Poaceae, associated
   with contrasting moisture environments. These lines were assessed for
   fitness in common garden reciprocal transplant experiments in two
   contrasting field sites in each of two years, as well as a novel, benign
   greenhouse environment. An AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism)
   linkage map of 129 markers spanned 644 cM in 19 linkage groups, which is
   smaller, with more linkage groups, than expected. Therefore parts of the
   A. barbata genome remain unmapped, possibly because they lack variation
   between the ecotypes. Nevertheless, we identified QTL (quantitative
   trait loci) under selection in both native environments and in the
   greenhouse. Across years at the same site, the same loci remain under
   selection, for the same alleles. Across sites, an overlapping set of
   loci are under selection with either (i) the same alleles favoured at
   both sites or (ii) loci under selection at one site and neutral at the
   other. QTL under selection in the greenhouse were generally unlinked to
   those under selection in the field because selection acted on a
   different trait. We found little evidence that selection favours
   alternate alleles in alternate environments, which would be necessary if
   genotype by environment interaction were to maintain genetic variation
   in A. barbata. Additive effect QTL were best able to explain the genetic
   variation among recombinant inbred lines for the greenhouse environment
   where heritability was highest, and past selection had not eliminated
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{Many domesticated crops are derived from species whose life history
   includes weedy characteristics, such as the ability to vary branching
   patterns in response to environmental conditions. However, domesticated
   crop plants are characterized by less variable plant architecture, as
   well as by a general reduction in vegetative branching compared to their
   progenitor species. Here we examine weedy green millet and its
   domesticate foxtail millet that differ in the number of tillers (basal
   branches) and axillary branches along each tiller. Branch number in
   F(2:3) progeny of a cross between the two species varies with genotype,
   planting density, and other environmental variables, with significant
   genotype-environment interactions (GEI). This is shown by a complex
   pattern of reaction norms and by variation in the pattern of significant
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) amongst trials. Individual and joint
   analyses of high and low density trials indicate that most QTL have
   significant GEI. Dominance and epistasis also explain some variation in
   branching. Likely candidate genes underlying the QTL (based on map
   position and phenotypic effect) include teosinte branched1 and barren
   stalk1. Phytochrome B, which has been found to affect response to
   shading in other plants, explains little or no variation. Much variation
   in branching is explained by QTL that do not have obvious candidate
   genes from maize or rice.}},

Abstract = {{A long-standing and fundamental question in biology is how genes
   influence complex phenotypes. Combining near-isogenic line mapping with
   genome expression profiling offers a unique opportunity for exploring
   the functional relationship between genotype and phenotype and for
   generating candidate genes for future study. We used a whole-genome
   microarray produced with ink-jet technology to measure the relative
   expression level of over 21 500 genes from an Arabidopsis thaliana
   near-isogenic line (NIL) and its recurrent parent. The NIL material
   contained two introgressions (bottom of chromosome II and top of
   chromosome III) of the Cvi-1 ecotype in a Ler-2 ecotype genome
   background. Each introgression `captures' a Cvi allele of a
   physiological quantitative trait loci (QTL) that our previous studies
   have shown increases transpiration and reduces water-use efficiency at
   the whole-plant level. We used a mixed model anova framework for
   assessing sources of expression variability and for evaluating
   statistical significance in our array experiment. We discovered 25
   differentially expressed genes in the introgression at a false-discovery
   rate (FDR) cut-off of 0.20 and identified new candidate genes for both
   QTL regions. Several differentially expressed genes were confirmed with
   QRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction)
   assays. In contrast, we found no statistically significant
   differentially expressed genes outside of the QTL introgressions after
   controlling for multiple tests. We discuss these results in the context
   of candidate genes, cloning QTL, and phenotypic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Ecotilling was used as a simple nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery
   tool to examine DNA variation in natural populations of the western
   black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, and was found to be more
   efficient than sequencing for large-scale studies of genetic variation
   in this tree. A publicly available, live reference collection of P.
   trichocarpa from the University of British Columbia Botanical Garden was
   used in this study to survey variation in nine different genes among
   individuals from 41 different populations. A large amount of genetic
   variation was detected, but the level of variation appears to be less
   than in the related species, Populus tremula, based on reported
   statistics for that tree. Genes examined varied considerably in their
   level of variation, from PoptrTB1 which had a single SNP, to PoptrLFY
   which had more than 23 in the 1000-bp region examined. Overall
   nucleotide diversity, measured as (Total), was relatively low at
   0.00184. Linkage disequilibrium, on the other hand, was higher than
   reported for some woody plant species, with mean r(2) equal to 0.34.
   This study reveals the potential of Ecotilling as a rapid genotype
   discovery method to explore and utilize the large pool of genetic
   variation in tree species.}},

Title = {{A genetic similarity rule determines arthropod community structure}},

Abstract = {{We define a genetic similarity rule that predicts how genetic variation
   in a dominant plant affects the structure of an arthropod community.
   This rule applies to hybridizing cottonwood species where plant genetic
   variation determines plant-animal interactions and structures a
   dependent community of leaf-modifying arthropods. Because the associated
   arthropod community is expected to respond to important plant traits, we
   also tested whether plant chemical composition is one potential
   intermediate link between plant genes and arthropod community
   composition. Two lines of evidence support our genetic similarity rule.
   First, in a common garden experiment we found that trees with similar
   genetic compositions had similar chemical compositions and similar
   arthropod compositions. Second, in a wild population, we found a similar
   relationship between genetic similarity in cottonwoods and the dependent
   arthropod community. Field data demonstrate that the relationship
   between genes and arthropods was also significant when the hybrids were
   analysed alone, i.e. the pattern is not dependent upon the inclusion of
   both parental species. Because plant-animal interactions and natural
   hybridization are common to diverse plant taxa, we suggest that a
   genetic similarity rule is potentially applicable, and may be extended,
   to other systems and ecological processes. For example, plants with
   similar genetic compositions may exhibit similar litter decomposition
   rates. A corollary to this genetic similarity rule predicts that in
   systems with low plant genetic variability, the environment will be a
   stronger factor structuring the dependent community. Our findings argue
   that the genetic composition of a dominant plant can structure higher
   order ecological processes, thus placing community and ecosystem ecology
   within a genetic and evolutionary framework. A genetic similarity rule
   also has important conservation implications because the loss of genetic
   diversity in one species, especially dominant or keystone species that
   define many communities, may cascade to negatively affect the rest of
   the dependent community.}},

Abstract = {{Bioluminescent colour in the Jamaican click beetle, Pyrophorus
   plagiophthalamus, is an ideal system for studies moving from gene to
   landscape to gain a holistic understanding of the molecular, ecological,
   and historical bases for adaptation. Previous studies have established
   the genetics of bioluminescent colour variation in the beetle to the
   level of the nucleotide base pair in the target gene luciferase. Three
   different luciferase colour alleles affecting ventral light organ colour
   {[}yellow-green (vYG), yellow (vYE), and orange (vOR)] were found
   segregating in P. plagiophthalamus populations. These alleles differ
   from each other in a number of replacement mutations (14 total), the
   majority of which (11) have a measurable effect on colour. Phylogenetic
   analysis revealed a long-term adaptive trend on Jamaica towards longer
   wavelength bioluminescence, culminating in the most recently derived vOR
   allele. Here, we further investigate the historical and geographic
   context of adaptive colour evolution by testing a vicariance model for
   the origins of the extant ventral light organ polymorphism: that the vOR
   allele arose and differentiated in an isolated deme on the east side of
   Jamaica before spreading westward. Comparisons of colour phenotypes,
   luciferase coding sequences, the third intron of the gene, mtDNA, and
   microsatellite data provided evidence for past population subdivision on
   Jamaica and ongoing gene flow, as has been found for other island
   endemics. However, the pattern of differentiation supported the
   allopatric divergence of vYG and vYE alleles. The vOR gene appears to
   have arisen relatively recently from a vYE precursor and postdates the
   period of major biogeographic isolation. We discuss the implications of
   the results for discerning ecological causation in the adaptive sequence
   from nucleotide to landscape to population change for bioluminescent
   colour.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed description of local population structure in Arabidopsis
   thaliana is presented, including an assessment of the genetic
   relatedness of individuals collected from the same field. A hierarchical
   sample of four individuals from 37 local populations, including North
   America, England, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia, and a selection
   of ecotypes, were analysed for variation in Adh, ChiA, FAH1, F3H, Rpm1,
   Rps5, and five microsatellite loci. Twenty-eight of the 37 population
   samples contained individuals with identical multilocus haplotypes, 12
   of which were fixed for a single haplotype. These monomorphic
   populations were evenly distributed over the species range. Only in
   North America did we find a single multilocus haplotype shared among
   different populations, perhaps indicating a continental founder event.
   Despite the occurrence of local inbreeding, a considerable amount of
   genetic variation was found segregating within and among local
   populations. A novel analysis of haplotype differences reveals that
   genetic differentiation occurs at every geographic scale in A. thaliana,
   where we find a surprising under-representation of recent migrants
   between local populations. This leads us to hypothesize that most
   dispersal between A. thaliana populations is by pollen rather than seed.
   Based on the structure of A. thaliana populations, it appears that
   regional groups of local populations may provide the most appropriate
   genetic material for linkage disequilibrium mapping of adaptive traits.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-seven microsatellite loci were used to define genetic variation
   and relationships among eight Indian riverine buffalo breeds. The total
   number of alleles ranged from 166 in the Toda breed to 194 each in the
   Mehsana and the Murrah. Significant departures from the Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium were observed for 26 locus-breed combinations due to
   heterozygote deficiency. Breed differentiation was analysed by
   estimation of F-ST, index (values ranging from 0.75\% to 6.00\%) for
   various breed combinations. The neighbour-joining tree constructed from
   chord distances, multidimensional scaling (MDS) display of F-ST values
   and Bayesian clustering approach consistently identified the Toda,
   Jaffarabadi, and Pandharpuri breeds as one lineage each, and the
   Bhadawari, Nagpuri, Surati, Mehsana and Murrah breeds as admixture.
   Analysis of molecular variance refuted the earlier classification of
   these breeds proposed on the basis of morphological and geographical
   parameters. The Toda buffaloes, reared by a tribe of the same name,
   represent an endangered breed from the Nilgiri hills in South India.
   Divergence time of the Toda buffaloes from the other main breeds,
   calculated from Nei's standard genetic distances based on genotyping
   data on seven breeds and 20 microsatellite loci, suggested separation of

Abstract = {{Owing to habitat loss populations of many organisms have declined and
   become fragmented. Vertebrate conservation strategies routinely consider
   genetic factors, but their importance in invertebrate populations is
   poorly understood. Bumblebees are important pollinators, and many
   species have undergone dramatic declines. As monoandrous social
   hymenopterans they may be particularly susceptible to inbreeding due to
   low effective population sizes. We study fragmented populations of a
   bumblebee species, on a model island system, and on mainland Great
   Britain where it is rare and declining. We use microsatellites to study:
   population genetic structuring and gene flow; the relationships between
   genetic diversity, population size and isolation; and frequencies of
   (sterile) diploid males -an indicator of inbreeding. We find significant
   genetic structuring (theta = 0.12) and isolation by distance.
   Populations > 10 km apart are all significantly differentiated, both on
   oceanic islands and on the mainland. Genetic diversity is reduced
   relative to closely related common species, and isolated populations
   exhibit further reductions. Of 16 populations, 10 show recent
   bottlenecking, and 3 show diploid male production. These results suggest
   that surviving populations of this rare insect suffer from inbreeding as
   a result of geographical isolation. Implications for the conservation of
   social hymenopterans are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, is a notorious exotic species
   in many freshwater ecosystems, currently expanding its distribution
   worldwide. In 1960, a small group of bluegills captured in the
   Mississippi River at Guttenberg in Iowa were imported to Japan as a gift
   from the mayor of Chicago to the Japanese government. The offspring of
   these fish were released into the wild in Japan and also in Korea. Over
   40 years after this first introduction, L. macrochirus now occupies all
   the freshwater ecosystems of both countries. We compared invading
   populations of L. macrochirus in Japan and Korea with native populations
   in the USA, using PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restricted
   fragment length polymorphism) analyses of mitochondrial DNA, to estimate
   the origin and dispersal of L. macrochirus in Japan and Korea. Five
   haplotypes of mitochondrial DNA detected in Japanese and Korean
   populations completely coincided with the haplotypes of the Guttenberg
   population. Haplotype diversity of invading populations was shown to be
   highest in populations established in the 1960s, while genetic
   variability was lower in more recently established populations. Our
   results suggest that all L. macrochirus in Japan and Korea have
   originated from the 15 fish first introduced in 1960. Low haplotype
   diversity in newly established populations is probably due to genetic
   drift arising from repeated population bottlenecks, while the high
   similarity of haplotypes among neighbouring populations is considered to
   reflect the history of transplantation by humans.}},

Abstract = {{The confounding effects of population structure complicate efforts to
   identify regions of the genome under the influence of selection in
   natural populations. Here we test for evidence of selection in three
   genes involved in vertebrate immune function - the major
   histocompatibility complex WHO, interferon gamma (IFNG) and natural
   resistance associated macrophage polymorphism (NRAMP) - in highly
   structured populations of wild thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli). We examined
   patterns of variation at microsatellite loci linked to these gene
   regions and at the DNA sequence level. Simple Watterson's tests
   indicated balancing selection at all three gene regions. However,
   evidence for selection was confounded by population structure, as the
   Watterson's test statistics from linked markers were not outside of the
   range of values from unlinked and presumably neutral microsatellites.
   The translated coding sequences of thinhorn IFNG and NRAMP are fixed and
   identical to those of domestic sheep (Ovis aries). In contrast, the
   thinhorn MHC DRB locus shows significant evidence of overdominance
   through both an excess of nonsynonymous substitution and trans-species
   polymorphism. The failure to detect balancing selection at
   microsatellite loci linked to the MHC is likely the result of
   recombination between the markers and expressed gene regions.}},

Abstract = {{The deep-sea soft-sediment environment hosts a diverse and highly
   endemic fauna of uncertain origin. We know little about how this fauna
   evolved because geographic patterns of genetic variation, the essential
   information for inferring patterns of population differentiation and
   speciation are poorly understood. Using formalin-fixed specimens from
   archival collections, we quantify patterns of genetic variation in the
   protobranch bivalve Deminticula atacellana, a species widespread
   throughout the Atlantic Ocean at bathyal and abyssal depths. Samples
   were taken from 18 localities in the North American, West European and
   Argentine basins. A hypervariable region of mitochondrial 16S rDNA was
   amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced from 130
   individuals revealing 21 haplotypes. Except for several important
   exceptions, haplotypes are unique to each basin. Overall gene diversity
   is high (h = 0.73) with pronounced population structure (Phi(ST) =
   0.877) and highly significant geographic associations (P < 0.0001).
   Sequences cluster into four major clades corresponding to differences in
   geography and depth. Genetic divergence was much greater among
   populations at different depths within the same basin, than among those
   at similar depths but separated by thousands of kilometres. Isolation by
   distance probably explains much of the interbasin variation.
   Depth-related divergence may reflect historical patterns of colonization
   or strong environmental selective gradients. Broadly distributed
   deep-sea organisms can possess highly genetically divergent populations,
   despite the lack of any morphological divergence.}},

Abstract = {{An important issue for designing any conservation programme aimed at
   preserving genetic diversity is estimation of the scale at which genetic
   structuring occurs. Additional relevant factors include distinguishing
   whether or not population structuring is expected to be stable as
   predicted by the member-vagrant hypothesis, or alternatively, whether
   populations are more prone to local extinction-recolonization processes,
   as predicted by the metapopulation evolutionary model. In this study,
   the population genetic structure of Atlantic salmon from 11 locations
   within or nearby the Varzuga River tributary system was assessed using
   17 microsatellites. Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses
   revealed a significant isolation-by-distance signal within the tributary
   system as well as a negative association between the level of genetic
   diversity and waterway distance from the river mouth, indicating that
   dispersal is less likely to occur to populations deep in the tributary
   system. Individual-level spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that
   the majority of migration occurred between populations situated within
   20 km of each other. The relatively high level of genetic structuring
   and significant isolation-by-distance signal observed in the Varzuga
   tributaries are concordant with the predictions of the member-vagrant
   evolutionary model. However, one subpopulation in particular revealed
   signs of instability which may be due to its location in the tidal zone,
   or due to the fact that it is more affected by human impacts. The
   results suggest that preservation of a number of spawning sites spaced
   throughout the tributary system is recommendable for ensuring
   sustainable fishing tourism in the river.}},

   of much debate. in this study, we examined the influence of
   hydrogeographic history and hybridization on the present distribution of
   nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation in two pupfish species,

   indicate that there has been limited introgression of nuclear genes;
   however, mtDNA introgression has been substantial, with complete
   replacement of the C. bifasciatus mitochondrial genome by that of C.
   atrorus. Subsequent to this replacement, there has been diversification
   of mitochondrial haplotypes along major geographic regions.,in the
   basin. Evidence was also found that mitochondrial replacement follows a
   predictable, cyclical pattern in this system, with isolation and
   diversification followed by re-contact and replacement of C. bifasciatus
   mitochondrial haplotypes by those of C. atrorus. This pattern is best
   explained by a combination of a numeric bias towards C. atrorus and
   mating site selection rather than selection for C. atrorus mitochondrial
   genome. These results demonstrate the important role hybridization can

Abstract = {{Host-race evolution is a prime candidate for sympatric speciation
   because host shifts must take place in the presence of both hosts.
   However, the geographic context in which the shift takes place may have
   strong allopatric or peripatric components if the primary host within a
   localized area is scarce or even goes extinct. Inference of the relative
   importance of the geographic mode of speciation may be gained from
   phylogeographic imprints. Here, we investigate the phylogeography of
   host races of the tephritid fly Tephritis conura from sympatric,
   parapatric and allopatric populations of Cirsium heterophyllum and
   Cirsium oleraceum (Asteraceae) in Europe, for addressing the age and
   direction, and the geographic context of host-race formation. Haplotype
   networks of the host races differed significantly in molecular diversity
   and topology. However, host-race haplotypes were nested within the same
   network, with a central haplotype H1 being the most common haplotype in
   both host races. C. heterophyllum flies were genetically more diverse
   and substructured than flies from C. oleracemn, suggesting that the
   latter is the derived race. The phylogeographic imprint indicates either
   that C. heterophyllum flies colonized C. oleracemn during range
   expansion or that heterophyllum flies went extinct in an area where
   oleraceum flies persisted (followed by re-immigration). These imprints
   are in concordance with peripatric diversification, probably in the
   European Alps and related to the last ice age, where the host-race
   diversification was largely completed before the postglacial range
   expansion on C. oleracemn to current areas of sympatry and parapatry
   with C. heterophyllum.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic barriers that limit the movement of individuals between
   populations may create or maintain phylogenetically discrete lineages.
   Such barriers are often inferred from geographic surveys of a single
   mitochondrial marker to identify phylogenetic splits. Mitochondrial DNA,
   however, has an effective population size one-fourth that of nuclear
   DNA, which can facilitate the rapid evolution of monophyletic mtDNA
   lineages in the absence of geographic barriers. The identification of
   geographic barriers will thus be more robust if barriers are proposed a
   priori, and tested with multiple independent genetic markers in multiple
   species. Here, we tested two proposed marine biogeographic breaks
   located at the Mona Passage in the Caribbean Sea and at the southern end
   of Exuma Sound in the Bahamas. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome b
   (400 bp) and nuclear rag1 (573 bp) for nine species and colour forms
   (183 individuals total) within the teleost genus Elacatinus (Gobiidae)
   that span the proposed breaks. Our results showed that Mona Passage
   separated mtcyb and rag1 lineages, with no genetic exchange between
   populations separated by just 23 km. However, the Central Bahamas
   barrier was only weakly supported by our data. Importantly, neither
   barrier coincided with deep genetic splits. This suggests that these two
   barriers did not initially isolate regional populations, but instead
   disrupt ongoing gene flow between regions. Our inferred relationships
   further suggested a division of the Caribbean region into northwestern
   and southeastern regions, a pattern reflected by some freshwater and
   terrestrial vertebrates. Our results, coupled with genetic and
   demographic data from other reef fishes and corals, provide robust
   support for the Mona Passage as a long-term biogeographic barrier for
   Caribbean animals.}},

   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and chloroplast DNA sequence data to
   unravel the history of their immigration into the Alps and to provide
   data on their circumpolar phylogeography. In spite of the similar
   ecological requirements of the two species, they exhibit strikingly
   different immigration histories into the Alps. In M. biflora, the Alpine
   populations are most probably derived from source populations located
   between the Alpine and Scandinavian ice sheets, in accordance with the
   traditional biogeographic hypothesis. In contrast, the Alpine
   populations of R. pygmaeus cluster with those from the Tatra Mountains
   and the Taymyr region in northern Siberia, indicating that the distant
   Taymyr area served as source for the Alpine populations. Both species
   showed different levels of genetic diversity in formerly glaciated
   areas. In contrast to the considerable AFLP diversity observed in M.
   biflora, R. pygmaeus was virtually nonvariable over vast areas, with a
   single phenotype dominating all over the Alps and another, distantly
   related one dominating the North Atlantic area from Greenland over

Abstract = {{The swordlike exaggerated caudal fin extensions of male swordtails are
   conspicuous traits that are selected for through female choice. Swords
   are one of only few examples where the hypothesis of a pre-existing bias
   is believed to apply for the evolution of a male trait. Previous
   laboratory experiments demonstrated that females prefer males with
   longer swords and even females from some swordless species show an
   affiliation for males of sworded species. Earlier phylogenetic studies
   based on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA placed the sworded
   southern swordtail Xiphophorus clemenciae with swordless platies,
   contradicting its morphology-based evolutionary affinities. The analyses
   of new nuclear DNA markers now recover its traditional phylogenetic
   placement with other southern swordtails, suggesting that this species
   was formed by an ancient hybridization event. We propose that sexual
   selection through female choice was the likely process of hybrid
   speciation, by mating of platy females with males of an ancestral
   swordtail lineage. In artificial crosses of descendent species from the
   two potential ancestral lineages of X. clemenciae the hybrid and
   backcross males have swords of intermediate lengths. Additionally, mate
   choice experiments demonstrate that hybrid females prefer sworded males.
   These experimental lines of evidence make hybridization through
   xeno-specific sexual selection by female choice the likely mechanism of
   speciation.}},

Abstract = {{C-mos is a highly conserved intronless gene that has proved useful in
   the analysis of ancient phylogenetic relationships within vertebrates.
   We selected the Iberian endemic Schreiber's green lizard (Lacerta

   to investigate the utility of the C-mos nuclear gene for intraspecific
   phylogeographic studies. Our combination of DNA sequencing with the high
   resolving power of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
   effectively discriminated four common alleles showing strong population
   structuring (F-ST = 0.46). In addition, reconstruction of allele
   phylogenetic relationships further improved our understanding of C-mos
   spatial patterns of variation and allowed a comparison with previously
   described mitochondrial DNA data. Finally, limited sequencing of an
   extended C-mos fragment in six additional Lacerta species showed
   extensive polymorphism, to our knowledge representing a rare example of
   variation in a highly conserved nuclear gene.}},

Abstract = {{Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are a powerful
   evolutionary model system due to the rapid and repeated phenotypic
   divergence of freshwater forms from a marine ancestor throughout the
   Northern Hemisphere. Many of these recently derived populations are
   found in overlapping habitats, yet are reproductively isolated from each
   other. This scenario provides excellent opportunities to investigate the
   mechanisms driving speciation in natural populations. Genetically
   distinguishing between such recently derived species, however, can
   create difficulties in exploring the ecological and genetic factors
   defining species boundaries, an essential component to our understanding
   of speciation. We overcame these limitations and increased the power of
   analyses by selecting highly discriminatory markers from the battery of
   genetic markers now available. Using species diagnostic molecular
   profiles, we quantified levels of hybridization and introgression within
   three sympatric species pairs of three-spined stickleback. Sticklebacks
   within Priest and Paxton lakes exhibit a low level of natural
   hybridization and provide support for the role of reinforcement in
   maintaining distinct species in sympatry. In contrast, our study
   provides further evidence for a continued breakdown of the Enos Lake
   species pair into a hybrid swarm, with biased introgression of the
   `limnetic' species into that of the `benthic'; a situation that
   highlights the delicate balance between persistence and breakdown of
   reproductive barriers between young species. A similar strategy
   utilizing the stickleback microsatellite resource can also be applied to
   answer an array of biological questions in other species' pair systems
   in this geographically widespread and phenotypically diverse model
   organism.}},

Abstract = {{Research on contact zones has paid relatively little attention to
   host-parasite interactions, although these situations have important but
   different implications depending on whether one considers the host or
   the parasite's perspective. We investigated both the role of a host
   contact zone in parasite expansion and whether parasites could influence
   contact zone dynamics. We studied the diversity and the patterns of
   parasite exchange (genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) infecting two
   parapatric sibling passerines meeting at a moving contact zone in
   western Europe. We amplified and sequenced a fragment of the parasite
   cytochrome b gene. The expanding host harboured more diverse parasites,
   which might indicate a superior ability to face a diverse parasite fauna
   than the receding host. Prevalence was very high in both hosts, due to
   the frequent occurrence of two sister Haemoproteus lineages. Despite the
   recent movement of the contact zone, these two parasites fitted almost
   perfectly to the geographic range of their main host species. Yet, we
   found several cases of cross-species infection in sympatric areas and
   evidences of asymmetrical spreading of parasites from the expanding host
   towards the receding host. Altogether, our results suggest that the host
   contact zone mainly acts as a barrier to parasite expansion even if
   recurrent host shifts are observed. Besides, they also support the idea
   that parasite-mediated competition might contribute to the displacement
   of hosts' contact zones, thereby emphasizing the role of parasitism on
   the population dynamics of sympatric species.}},

Abstract = {{Species whose geographical distribution encompasses both mainland and
   island populations provide an ideal system for examining isolation and
   genetic divergence. In this study, paternally transmitted chloroplast
   DNA (cpDNA) and maternally transmitted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were
   used to estimate population structure and phylogeography of Pinus
   luchuensis, a species found in eastern China (ssp. hwangshanensis),
   Taiwan (ssp. taiwanensis), and the Ryukyu Archipelago (ssp. luchuensis).
   Gene genealogies of both mtDNA and cpDNA reveal two major lineages.
   Molecular dating indicates that these lineages diverged before the
   colonization of P. luchuensis subspecies in Taiwan and the Ryukyu
   Archipelago. Both mtDNA and cpDNA show a lack of correspondence between
   molecular phylogeny and subspecies designation. Phylogeographical
   analysis suggests that paraphyly of the subspecies is the result of
   recent divergence rather than secondary contacts. In spite of the short
   divergence history of P. luchuensis on islands, the island populations
   show the same degree of genetic divergence as mainland populations. Low
   levels of genetic diversity in the mainland ssp. hwangshanensis suggest
   demographic bottlenecks. In contrast, the high heterogeneity of genetic
   composition for island populations is likely to be associated with a
   history of multiple colonization from the mainland. The spatial
   apportionment of organelle DNA polymorphisms is consistent with a
   pattern of stepwise colonization on island populations.}},

Abstract = {{The southern African landscape appears to have experienced frequent
   shifts in vegetation associated with climatic change through the
   mid-Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene. One group whose historical
   biogeography may have been affected by these fluctuations are the dwarf
   chameleons (Bradypodion), due to their associations with distinct
   vegetation types. Thus, this group provides an opportunity to
   investigate historical biogeography in light of climatic fluctuations. A
   total of 138 dwarf chameleons from the Cape Floristic Region of South
   Africa were sequenced for two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S), and
   resulting phylogenetic analyses showed two well-supported clades that
   are distributed allopatrically. Within clades, diversity among some
   lineages was low, and haplotype networks showed patterns of reticulate
   evolution and incomplete lineage sorting, suggesting relatively recent
   origins for some of these lineages. A dispersal-vicariance analysis and
   a relaxed Bayesian clock suggest that vicariance between the two main
   clades occurred in the mid-Miocene, and that both dispersal and
   vicariance have played a role in shaping present-day distributions.
   These analyses also suggest that the most recent series of lineage
   diversification events probably occurred within the last 3-6 million
   years. This suggests that the origins of many present-day lineages were
   founded in the Plio-Pleistocene, a time period that corresponds to the
   reduction of forests in the region and the establishment of the fynbos
   biome.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of phylogeography, speciation, and species limits restrict
   their focus to a narrow issue: gene tree monophyly. However, reciprocal
   monophyly does not provide an ideal touchstone criterion of any aspect
   of evolutionary divergence. There is a continuum of divergence stages as
   isolated populations go from initial allele frequency differences to
   well-differentiated species. Studying intermediate stages of divergence
   will increase our understanding of geographical speciation, species
   limits, and conservation priorities. We develop a conceptual framework
   and terminology for thinking about the stages of `intermediate
   polyphyly'. The Holarctic clade of common ravens (Corvus corax), found
   throughout much of Eurasia and North America, provides a case study of
   these stages of intermediate divergence. We used coalescent,
   phylogenetic, and population genetic methods to investigate the history
   and current status of this Old World-New World distribution using 107
   mitochondrial control region sequences. Phylogenetically, New World and
   Old World samples are intermixed. However, most samples are grouped into
   small subclades that are restricted to either the New World or the Old
   World, and only one haplotype is shared between the hemispheres.
   Analysis of moleculalr variance (AMOVA) results reflect this low
   haplotype sharing between hemispheres (Phi(ST) = 0.13, P < 0.01).
   Isolation with Migration (IM) coalescent results suggest a sustained
   period of divergence between the hemispheres and low levels of maternal
   gene flow. Although there has not been sufficient time to evolve
   reciprocal monophyly and some gene flow may occur, New World and Old
   World ravens are genetically quite distinct. We use this example to
   demonstrate these early stages of divergence as populations go from
   sharing only internal haplotypes, to sharing no haplotypes, to having
   population specific subclades. Studies of phylogeography, speciation and
   systematics will benefit from increased attention to these stages of
   intermediate polyphyly.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization is thought to be an important source of novel genetic
   variation, and interspecific hybridization may increase the adaptive
   potential of wild populations. While hybridization has not been
   previously reported in syngnathid fishes (seahorses and pipefish), the
   sympatric occurrence of closely related species at high densities
   increases the probability of interspecies mating in this group. Southern
   California is home to five species of Syngnathus pipefish, and these
   species frequently co-occur in near-shore eelgrass beds along the
   California coast. Recent work has identified exceptionally high levels
   of genetic diversity in southern populations of Syngnathus
   leptorhynchus, a widespread species which ranges from Mexico to Alaska.
   Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial sequence data are used here
   to study the population genetics of S. leptorhynchus and S. auliscus at
   a site in San Diego Bay where they are found to co-occur at high
   densities. While no adult hybrids were detected in the study population,
   analysis of male broods indicates that interspecies mating is occurring
   between the two species. The lack of premating isolating mechanisms
   between these two relatives suggests that hybridization may be common in
   sympatric species of Syngnathus.}},

Abstract = {{Arabis alpina is a characteristic plant in arctic-alpine habitats and
   serves as a classical example to demonstrate biology, ecology and
   biogeography of arctic-alpine disjuncts. It has a wider distribution
   than most other arctic-alpine plants, covering all European mountain
   systems, the Canary Islands, North Africa, the high mountains of East
   Africa and Ethiopia, the Arabian Peninsula and mountain ranges of
   Central Asia in Iran and Iraq. Additionally it is found in the northern
   amphi-Atlantic area including northeastern North America, Greenland,
   Iceland, Svalbard and northwestern Europe. We used markers from the
   nuclear (internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA) and chloroplast
   genome (trnL-F region) to reconstruct its phylogeographic history. Both
   markers revealed clear phylogeographic structure. We suggest that A.
   alpina originated in Asia Minor less than 2 million years ago based on
   synonymous mutation rates of different genes (plastidic matK, nuclear
   adh and chs). From the Asian ancestral stock one group migrated via the
   Arabian Peninsula to the East African high mountains. A second group
   gave rise to all European and northern populations, and also served as
   source for the northwest African populations. A third group, which is
   still centred in Asia, migrated independently southwards and came into
   secondary contact with the East African lineage in Ethiopia, resulting
   in high genetic diversity in this area. In the Mediterranean regions,
   the genetic diversity was relatively high with numerous unique
   haplotypes, but almost without geographic structure. In contrast, the
   populations in the northern amphi-Atlantic area were extremely
   depauperate, suggesting very recent (postglacial) expansion into this
   vast area from the south.}},

Abstract = {{Models of sexual selection assume that female mating preferences are
   heritable and, thus, repeatable for individual females across multiple
   mating episodes. Previous studies of the repeatability of female
   preference have examined individuals in captivity and focused presumably
   on social mate choice. However, extra-pair mating is widespread and can
   also influence sexual selection. We examined the repeatability of
   extra-pair mating in a wild population of tree swallows (Tachycineta
   bicolor) by experimentally inducing females to lay two clutches in rapid
   succession within the same season. We found that the proportion of
   extra-pairyoung and the number of extra-pair sires were highly
   repeatable for individual females. However, the repeatability of
   specific extra-pair sires was low. We suggest that this unusual pattern
   of mating may be due to females maximizing the heterozygosity of their
   offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors interact to determine genetic structure within populations
   including adult density, the mating system, colonization history,
   natural selection, and the mechanism and spatial patterns of gene
   dispersal. We examined spatial genetic structure within colonizing
   populations of Quercus rubra seedlings and Pintis strobus juveniles and
   adults in an aspen-white pine forest in northern Michigan, USA. A
   20-year spatially explicit demographic study of the forest enables us to
   interpret the results in light of recent colonization of the site for
   both species. We assayed 217 Q. rubra seedlings and 171 P. strobus
   individuals at 11 polymorphic loci using nine allozyme systems. Plant
   genotypes and locations were used in an analysis of spatial genetic
   structure. Q. rubra and A strobus showed similar observed levels of
   heterozygosity, but Q. rubra seedlings have less heterozygosity than
   expected. Q. rubra seedlings show spatial genetic clumping of
   individuals on a scale to 25 m and levels of genetic relatedness
   expected from the clumped dispersion of half-siblings. In contrast, P.
   strobus has low levels of genetic relatedness at the smallest distance
   class and positive spatial genetic structure at scales < 10 m within the
   plot. The low density of adult Q. rubra outside the study plot and
   limited, spatially clumped rodent dispersal of acorns is likely
   responsible for the observed pattern of spatial genetic structure and
   the observed heterozygote deficit (i.e. a Wahlund effect). We attribute
   weaker patterns observed in P. strobus to the longer dispersal distance
   of seeds and the historical overlap of seed shadows from adults outside
   of the plot coupled with the overlap of seed shadows from younger, more
   recently established reproductive adults. The study demonstrates the
   utility of long-term demographic data in interpreting mechanisms
   responsible for generating contemporary patterns of genetic structure
   within populations.}},

Abstract = {{The speed and the dynamics of the co-evolutionary process strongly
   depend on the relative strengths of reciprocal selection pressures
   exerted by the interacting species. Here, we investigate the influence
   of an obligate social parasite, the slave-making ant Harpagoxenus
   sublaevis, on populations of the two main host species Leptothorax
   acervortum and Leptothorax muscorum from a German ant community. A
   combination of genetic and demographic data allowed us to analyse the
   consequences of raiding pressure on the hosts' life history and possible
   host preferences of the parasite. We can demonstrate that slave raids
   during which the social parasite pillages brood from neighbouring host
   colonies are both frequent and extremely destructive for both host
   species. Microsatellite analysis showed that, on average, a single
   slave-maker colony conducts more than three raids per year and that host
   colonies mostly perish in the aftermath of these parasite attacks. Only
   in few cases, surviving nests of previously raided host colonies were
   found in the surroundings of slave-maker colonies. As a consequence of
   the high prevalence of parasites and their recurrent and devastating
   slave raids on host colonies, the life expectancy of host colonies was
   severely reduced. Combining our results on host-specific parasitic
   colony founding and raiding frequencies with the post-raid survival
   rate, we can demonstrate an overall higher mortality rate for the
   smaller host species L. muscorum. This might be caused by a preference
   of H. sublaevis for this secondary host species as demographic data on
   host species usage indicate.}},

Abstract = {{Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) is an
   increasingly popular method in molecular ecology. However, several key
   limitations of this method have not been fully examined especially when
   used to study fungi. We investigated the impact of spore contamination,
   intracollection ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region
   variation, and conserved restriction enzyme recognition loci on the
   results produced by TRFLP to characterize soil fungal communities. We
   find that 6) the potential for nontarget structures such as spores to
   contribute DNA to target sample extractions is high; GO multiple
   fragments (i.e. `extra peaks') per PCR primer-restriction enzyme
   combination can be detected that are caused by restriction enzyme
   inefficiency and intracollection ribosomal DNA ITS variation; and (iii)
   restriction enzyme digestion in conserved vs. variable gene regions
   leads to different characterizations of community diversity. Based on
   these results, we suggest that studies employing TRFLP need to include

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity is recognized as an important population attribute for
   both conservation and evolutionary purposes; however, the functional
   relationships between the environment, genetic diversity, and
   fitness-related traits are poorly understood. We examined relationships
   between selected lake parameters and population genetic diversity
   measures in 46 walleye (Sander vitreus) populations across the province
   of Ontario, Canada, and then tested for relationships between six life
   history traits (in three categories: growth, reproductive investment,
   and mortality) that are closely related to fitness, and genetic
   diversity measures (heterozygosity, d(2), and Wright's inbreeding
   coefficient). Positive relationships were observed between lake surface
   area, growing degree days, number of species, and hatchery
   supplementation versus genetic diversity. Walleye early growth rate was
   the only life history trait significantly correlated with population
   heterozygosity in both males and females. The relationship between F-IS
   and male early growth rate was negative and significant (P < 0.01) and
   marginally nonsignificant for females (P = 0.06), consistent with
   inbreeding depression effects. Only one significant relationship was
   observed for d(2): female early growth rate (P < 0.05). Stepwise
   regression models showed that surface area and heterozygosity had a
   significant effect on female early growth rate, while hatchery
   supplementation, surface area and heterozygosity had a significant
   effect on male early growth rate. The strong relationship between lake
   parameters, such as surface area, and hatchery supplementation, versus
   genetic diversity suggests inbreeding and outbreeding in some of the
   populations; however, the weak relationships between genetic diversity
   and life history traits indicate that inbreeding and outbreeding
   depression are not yet seriously impacting Ontario walleye populations.}},

Abstract = {{DNA from archived otoliths was used to explore the temporal stability of
   the genetic composition of two cod populations, the Moray Firth (North
   Sea) sampled in 1965 and 2002, and the Bornholm Basin (Baltic Sea)
   sampled in 1928 and 1997. We found no significant changes in the allele
   frequencies for the Moray Firth population, while subtle but significant
   genetic changes over time were detected for the Bornholm Basin
   population. Estimates of the effective population size (N-e) generally
   exceeded 500 for both populations when employing a number of varieties
   of the temporal genetic method. However, confidence intervals were very
   wide and N-e's most likely range in the thousands. There was no apparent
   loss of genetic variability and no evidence of a genetic bottleneck for
   either of the populations. Calculations of the expected levels of
   genetic variability under different scenarios of N-e showed that the
   number of alleles commonly reported at microsatellite loci in Atlantic
   cod is best explained by N-e's exceeding thousand. Recent
   fishery-induced bottlenecks can, however, not be ruled out as an
   explanation for the apparent discrepancy between high levels of
   variability and recently reported estimates of N-e << 1000. From life
   history traits and estimates of survival rates in the wild, we evaluate
   the compatibility of the species' biology and extremely low N-e/N
   ratios. Our data suggest that very small N-e's are not likely to be of
   general concern for cod populations and, accordingly, most populations
   do not face any severe threat of losing evolutionary potential due to
   genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{Insertions and deletions (indels) result in sequences of various lengths
   when homologous gene regions are compared among individuals or species.
   Although indels are typically phylogenetically informative, occurrence
   and incorporation of these characters as gaps in intraspecific
   population genetic data sets are rarely discussed. Moreover, the impact
   of gaps on estimates of fixation indices, such as F-ST, has not been
   reviewed. Here, I summarize the occurrence and population genetic signal
   of indels among 60 published studies that involved alignments of
   multiple sequences from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of
   vertebrate taxa. Among 30 studies observing indels, an average of 12\%
   of both variable and parsimony-informative sites were composed of these
   sites. There was no consistent trend between levels of population
   differentiation and the number of gap characters in a data block. Across
   all studies, the average influence on estimates of Phi(ST) was small,
   explaining only an additional 1.8\% of among population variance (range
   0.0-8.0\%). Studies most likely to observe an increase in Phi(ST) with
   the inclusion of gap characters were those with < 20 variable sites, but
   a near equal number of studies with few variable sites did not show an
   increase. In contrast to studies at interspecific levels, the influence

Abstract = {{Historically, six small lakes in southwestern British Columbia each
   contained a sympatric species pair of three-spined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These pairs consisted of a `benthic' and
   `limnetic' species that had arisen postglacially and, in four of the
   lakes, independently. Sympatric sticklebacks are considered biological
   species because they are morphologically, ecologically and genetically
   distinct and because they are strongly reproductively isolated from one
   another. The restricted range of the species pairs places them at risk
   of extinction, and one of the pairs has gone extinct after the
   introduction of an exotic catfish. In another lake, Enos Lake,
   southeastern Vancouver Island, an earlier report suggested that its
   species pair is at risk from elevated levels of hybridization. We
   conducted a detailed morphological analysis, as well as genetic analysis
   of variation at five microsatellite loci for samples spanning a time
   frame of 1977 to 2002 to test the hypothesis that the pair in Enos Lake
   is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Our morphological analysis showed a
   clear breakdown between benthics and limnetics. Bayesian model-based
   clustering indicated that two morphological clusters were evident in
   1977 and 1988, which were replaced by 1997 by a single highly variable
   cluster. The most recent 2000 and 2002 samples confirm the breakdown.
   Microsatellite analysis corroborated the morphological results. Bayesian
   analyses of population structure in a sample collected in 1994 indicated
   two genetically distinct populations in Enos Lake, but only a single
   genetic population was evident in 1997, 2000, and 2002. In addition,
   genetic analyses of samples collected in 1997, 2000, and 2002 showed
   strong signals of `hybrids'; they were genetically intermediate to
   parental genotypes. Our results support the idea that the Enos Lake
   species pair is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Although the precise
   mechanism(s) responsible for elevated hybridization in the lake is
   unknown, the demise of the Enos Lake species pair follows the appearance
   of an exotic crayfish, Pascifasticus lenisculus, in the early 1990s.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Boechera is a widespread North American group with great
   potential for studies of ecology and evolution: Boechera is closely
   related to Arabidopsis and exhibits different ecological and
   reproductive strategies. Boechera stricta (previously Arabis drummondii)
   is a morphologically and genetically well-defined, perennial crucifer
   species. Fifteen natural populations of diploid individuals from the
   Rocky Mountains were analysed using 21 microsatellite loci. In
   accordance with our expectation for this predominately inbreeding
   species, a high F-IS value (0.89) was observed. Furthermore, populations
   of B. stricta were highly differentiated, as indicated by F-ST = 0.56.
   Three clusters were identified using STRUCTURE-the majority of
   populations belonged to either the Northern or Southern cluster.
   Together, the north-south partitioning and evenness of genetic variation
   across the two clusters suggested multiple refugia for this perennial
   herb in the Rocky Mountains. Pleistocene glaciation, together with the
   topographically and climatologically heterogeneous cordillera, has
   profoundly influenced the genetic architecture of B. stricta. Genetic
   population structure was also influenced by relatively recent genome
   admixture at two levels: within species (involving individuals from the
   Northern and Southern clusters) and between species (with the
   hybridization of B. stricta and Boechera holboellii). This complexity of
   population structure at presumably neutral microsatellite loci located
   throughout the genome in B. stricta provides a baseline against which to
   test whether functional genetic variation is undergoing local adaptive
   evolution throughout the natural species range.}},

Abstract = {{Eurasian badgers, Meles meles, have been shown to possess limited
   genetic population structure within Europe; however, field studies have
   detected high levels of philopatry, which are expected to increase
   population structure. Population structure will be a consequence of both
   contemporary dispersal and historical processes, each of which is
   expected to be evident at a different scale. Therefore, to gain a
   greater understanding of gene flow in the badger, we examined
   microsatellite diversity both among and within badger populations,
   focusing on populations from the British Isles and western Europe. We
   found that while populations differed in their allelic diversity, the
   British Isles displayed a similar degree of diversity to the rest of
   western Europe. The lower genetic diversity occurring in Ireland, Norway
   and Scotland was more likely to have resulted from founder effects
   rather than contemporary population density. While there was significant
   population structure (F(ST) = 0.19), divergence among populations was
   generally well explained by geographic distance (P < 0.0001) across the
   entire range studied of more than 3000 km. Transient effects from the
   Pleistocene appear to have been replaced by a strong pattern of genetic
   isolation by distance across western Europe, suggestive of colonization
   from a single refugium. Analysis of individuals within British
   populations through Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation
   demonstrated that there was significant local population structure
   across 3-30 km, confirming that dispersal is indeed restricted. The
   isolation by distance observed among badger populations across western
   Europe is likely to be a consequence of this restricted local dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Noninvasive faecal DNA sampling has the potential to provide a wealth of
   information necessary for monitoring and managing endangered species
   while eliminating the need to capture, handle or observe rare
   individuals. However, scoring problems, and subsequent genotyping
   errors, associated with this monitoring method remain a great concern as
   they can lead to misidentification of individuals and biased estimates.
   We examined a kit fox scat data set (353 scats; 80 genotypes) for
   genotyping errors using both genetic and GIS analyses, and evaluated the
   feasibility of combining both approaches to assess reliability of the
   faecal DNA results. We further checked the appropriateness of using
   faecal genotypes to study kit fox populations by describing information
   about foxes that we could deduce from the `acceptable' scat genotypes,
   and comparing it to information gathered with traditional field
   techniques. Overall, genetic tests indicated that our data set had a low
   rate of genotyping error. Furthermore, examination of distributions of
   scat locations confirmed our data set was relatively error free. We
   found that analysing information on sex primer consistency and scat
   locations provided a useful assessment of scat genotype error, and
   greatly limited the amount of additional laboratory work that was needed
   to identify potentially `false' scores. `Acceptable' scat genotypes
   revealed information on sex ratio, relatedness, fox movement patterns,
   latrine use, and size of home range. Results from genetic and field data
   were consistent, supporting the conclusion that our data set had a very
   low rate of genotyping error and that this noninvasive method is a
   reliable approach for monitoring kit foxes.}},

Abstract = {{The population genetics and phylogeography of African phytophagous
   insects have received little attention. Some, such as the maize stalk
   borer Busseola fusca, display significant geographic differences in
   ecological preferences that may be congruent with patterns of molecular
   variation. To test this, we collected 307 individuals of this species
   from maize and cultivated sorghum at 52 localities in West, Central and
   East Africa during the growing season. For all collected individuals, we
   sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. We tested
   hypotheses concerning the history and demographic structure of this
   species. Phylogenetic analyses and nested clade phylogeographic analyses
   (NCPA) separated the populations into three mitochondrial clades, one
   from West Africa, and two - Kenya I and Kenya II - from East and Central
   Africa. The similar nucleotide divergence between clades and nucleotide
   diversity within clades suggest that they became isolated at about the
   same time in three different refuges in sub-Saharan Africa and have
   similar demographic histories. The results of mismatch distribution
   analyses were consistent with the demographic expansion of these clades.
   Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a high level of
   geographic differentiation at different hierarchical levels. NCPA
   suggested that the observed distribution of haplotypes at several
   hierarchical levels within the three major clades is best accounted for
   by restricted gene flow with isolation by distance. The domestication of
   sorghum and the introduction of maize in Africa had no visible effect on
   the geographic patterns observed in the B. fusca mitochondrial genome.}},

Abstract = {{Serpula himantioides (Boletales, Basidiomycota) produces thin resupinate
   basidiocarps on dead coniferous wood worldwide and causes damage in
   buildings as well. In this study, we present evidence for the existence
   of at least three phylogenetically defined cryptic species (referred to
   as Sib I-III) within the morphospecies S. himantioides, a conclusion
   based on analyses of sequence data from four DNA regions and amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPS). A low degree of shared sequence
   polymorphisms was observed among the three lineages indicating a
   long-lasting separation. The AFLPs revealed two additional subgroups
   within Sib III. Results from mating studies were consistent with the
   molecular data. In Sib III, no correspondence between genetic and
   geographical distance was observed among isolates worldwide, presumably
   reflecting recent dispersal events. Our results indicate that at least
   two of the lineages (Sib II and Sib III) have wide sympatric
   distributions. A population genetic analysis of Sib III isolates,
   scoring sequence polymorphisms as codominant SNP markers, indicates that
   panmictic conditions exist in the Sib III group. This study supports the
   view that cryptic speciation is a common phenomenon in basidiomycete
   fungi and that phylogenetic species recognition can be a powerful
   inference to detect cryptic species. Furthermore, this study shows that
   AFLP data are a valuable supplement to DNA sequence data in that they
   may detect a finer level of genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The three living species of manatees, West Indian (Trichechus manatus),
   Amazonian (Trichechus inunguis) and West African (Trichechus
   senegalensis), are distributed across the shallow tropical and
   subtropical waters of America and the western coast of Africa. We have
   sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region in 330 Trichechus to
   compare their phylogeographic patterns. In T. manatus we observed a
   marked population structure with the identification of three haplotype
   clusters showing a distinct spatial distribution. A geographic barrier
   represented by the continuity of the Lesser Antilles to Trinidad Island,
   near the mouth of the Orinoco River in Venezuela, appears to have
   restricted the gene flow historically in T. manatus. However, for T.
   inunguis we observed a single expanding population cluster, with a high
   diversity of very closely related haplotypes. A marked geographic
   population structure is likely present in T. senegalensis with at least
   two distinct clusters. Phylogenetic analyses with the mtDNA cytochrome b
   gene suggest a clade of the marine Trichechus species, with T. inunguis
   as the most basal trichechid. This is in agreement with previous
   morphological analyses. Mitochondrial DNA, autosomal microsatellites and
   cytogenetic analyses revealed the presence of hybrids between the T.
   manatus and T. inunguis species at the mouth of the Amazon River in
   Brazil, extending to the Guyanas and probably as far as the mouth of the
   Orinoco River. Future conservation strategies should consider the
   distinct population structure of manatee species, as well as the
   historical barriers to gene flow and the likely occurrence of
   interspecific hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{Volcanic islands with well-characterized geological histories can
   provide ideal templates for generating and testing phylogeographic
   predictions. Many studies have sought to utilize these to investigate
   patterns of colonization and speciation within groups of closely related
   species across a number of islands. Here we focus attention within a
   single volcanic island with a well-characterized geological history to
   develop and test phylogeographic predictions. We develop phylogeographic
   predictions within the island of La Palma of the Canary Islands and test
   these using 69 haplotypes from 570 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA
   cytochrome oxidase II sequence data for 138 individuals of Brachyderes
   rugatus rugatus, a local endemic subspecies of curculionid beetle
   occurring throughout the island in the forests of Pinus canariensis.
   Although geological data do provide some explanatory power for the
   phylogeographic patterns found, our network-based analyses reveal a more
   complicated phylogeographic history than initial predictions generated
   from data on the geological history of the island. Reciprocal
   illumination of geological and phylogeographic history is also
   demonstrated with previous geological speculation gaining
   phylogeographic corroboration from our analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The 500-1000 cichlid species endemic to Lake Malawi constitute one of
   the most rapid and extensive radiations of vertebrates known. There is a
   growing debate over the role natural and sexual selection have played in
   creating this remarkable assemblage of species. Phylogenetic analysis of
   the Lake Malawi species flock has been confounded by the lack of
   appropriate morphological characters and an exceptional rate of
   speciation, which has allowed ancestral molecular polymorphisms to
   persist within species. To overcome this problem we used amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to reconstruct the evolution of
   species within three genera of Lake Malawi sand-dwelling cichlids that
   construct elaborate male display platforms, or bowers. Sister taxa with
   distinct bower morphologies, and that exist in discrete leks separated
   by only 1-2 m of depth, are divergent in both sexually selected and
   ecological traits. Our phylogeny suggests that the forces of sexual and
   ecological selection are intertwined during the speciation of this group
   and that specific bower characteristics and trophic morphologies have
   evolved repeatedly. These results suggest that trophic morphology and
   bower form may be inappropriate characters for delineating taxonomic
   lineages. Specifically the morphological characters used to describe the
   genera Lethrinops and Tramitichromis do not define monophyletic clades.
   Using a combination of behavioural and genetic characters, we were able
   to identify several cryptic cichlid species on a single beach, which
   suggests that sand dweller species richness has been severely
   underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Insect parasitoids are important components of many terrestrial
   ecosystems. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms
   responsible for structuring their populations. Here we investigate the
   ability of Megastigmus stigmatizans, an oak gall wasp parasitoid, to
   track its host Andricus kollari over two different timescales, and
   examine its current population structure across a divide in host
   population structure. The divide represents a transition in gall wasp
   host-plant species and offers the opportunity to examine whether the
   split, which divides gall wasp populations, manifests itself in the next
   trophic level. Analysis of mitochondrial haplotype data for parasitoid
   and host reveals: (i) A similar phylogeographic population structure for
   both, with Iberian populations more derived with respect to more eastern
   populations. (ii) It is likely that the host colonized the Iberian
   refuge earlier than the parasitoid, probably by at least one glacial
   cycle. (iii) Recent range expansion of central European host populations
   northwards has resulted in pursuit by parasitoids from the same
   geographic origin. (iv) In addition, Iberian parasitoid populations have
   crossed a major divide in host population structure to invade northern
   Europe. Such human-facilitated escape from natural refugial
   distributions may have important implications for the composition and
   structure of northern European gall wasp communities.}},

Abstract = {{Among European Neottieae, Limodorum abortivum is a common Mediterranean
   orchid. It forms small populations with a patchy distribution in
   woodlands, and is characterized by much reduced leaves, suggesting a
   partial mycoheterotrophy. We have investigated both the photosynthetic
   abilities of L. abortivum adult plants and the diversity of mycorrhizal
   fungi in Limodorum plants growing in different environments and plant
   communities (coniferous and broadleaf forests) over a wide geographical
   and altitudinal range. Despite the presence of photosynthetic pigments,
   CO2 fixation was found to be insufficient to compensate for respiration
   in adult plants. Fungal diversity was assessed by morphological and
   molecular methods in L. abortivum as well as in the related rare species
   Limodorum trabutianum and Limodorum brulloi. Phylogenetic analyses of
   the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, obtained from
   root samples of about 80 plants, revealed a tendency to associate
   predominantly with fungal symbionts of the genus Russula. Based on
   sequence similarities with known species, most root endophytes could be
   ascribed to the species complex encompassing Russula delica, Russula
   chloroides, and Russula brevipes. Few sequences clustered in separate
   groups nested within Russula, a genus of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The
   morphotypes of ectomycorrhizal root tips of surrounding trees yielded
   sequences similar or identical to those obtained from L. abortivum.
   These results demonstrate that Limodorum species with inefficient
   photosynthesis specifically associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi, and
   appear to have adopted a nutrition strategy similar to that known from
   achlorophyllous orchids.}},

Abstract = {{The fungus-growing termites Macrotermes cultivate the obligate
   ectosymbiontic fungi, Termitomyces. While their relationship has been
   extesively studied, little is known about the gut bacterial symbionts,
   which also presumably play a crucial role for the nutrition of the
   termite host. In this study, we investigated the bacterial gut
   microbiota in two colonies of Macrotermes gilvus, and compared the
   diversity and community structure of bacteria among nine termite
   morphotypes, differing in caste and/or age, using terminal restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clonal analysis of S-16 rRNA.
   The obtained molecular community profiles clustered by termite
   morphotype rather than by colony, and the clustering pattern was clearly
   more related to a difference in age than to caste. Thus, we suggest that
   the bacterial gut microbiota change in relation to the food of the
   termite, which comprises fallen leaves and the fungus nodules of
   Termitomyces in young workers, and leaves degraded by the fungi, in old
   workers. Despite these intracolony variations in bacterial gut
   microbiota, their T-RFLP profiles formed a distinct cluster against
   those of the fungus garden, adjacent soil and guts of sympatric
   wood-feeding termites, implying a consistency and uniqueness of gut
   microbiota in M. gilvus. Since many bacterial phylotypes from M. gilvus
   formed monophyletic clusters with those from distantly related termite
   species, we suggest that gut bacteria have co-evolved with the termite
   host and form a microbiota specific to a termite taxonomic and/or
   feeding group, and furthermore, to caste and age within a termite
   species.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the variations in gene content and sequence divergence
   that could be associated with symbiotic adaptations in the
   ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus and the closely related
   species Paxillus filamentosus. Strains with various abilities to form
   mycorrhizae were analysed by comparative genomic hybridizations using a
   cDNA microarray containing 1076 putative unique genes of P. involutus.
   To screen for genes diverging at an enhanced and presumably non-neutral
   rate, we implemented a simple rate test using information from both the
   variations in hybridizations signal and data on sequence divergence of
   the arrayed genes relative to the genome of Coprinus cinereus. C.
   cinereus is a free-living saprophyte and is the closest evolutionary
   relative to P. involutus that has been fully sequenced. Approximately
   17\% of the genes investigated were detected as rapidly diverging within
   Paxillus. Furthermore, 6\% of the genes varied in copy numbers between
   the analysed strains. Genome rearrangements associated with this
   variation including duplications and deletions may also play a role in
   adaptive evolution. The cohort of divergent and duplicated genes showed
   an over-representation of either orphans, genes whose products are
   located at membranes, or genes encoding for components of stress/defence
   reactions. Some of the identified genomic changes may be associated with
   the variation in host specificity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The proposed
   procedure could be generally applicable to screen for rapidly evolving
   genes in closely related strains or species where at least one has been
   sequenced or characterized by expressed sequence tag analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Colour vision varies within the family Atelidae (Primates, Platyrrhini),
   which consists of four genera with the following cladistic relationship:
   \{Alouatta{[}Ateles (Lagothrix and Brachyteles)]\}. Spider monkeys
   (Ateles) and woolly monkeys (Lagothrix) are characteristic of
   platyrrhine monkeys in possessing a colour vision polymorphism. The
   polymorphism results from allelic variation of the single-locus
   middle-to-long wavelength (M/L) cone opsin gene on the X-chromosome. The
   presence in the population of alleles coding for different M/L
   photopigments results in a variety of colour vision phenotypes. Such a
   polymorphism is absent in howling monkeys (Alouatta), which, alone among
   platyrrhines, acquired uniform trichromatic vision similar to that of
   Old World monkeys, apes, and humans through opsin gene duplication.
   Dietary and morphological similarities between howling monkeys and
   muriquis (Brachyteles) raise the possibility that the two genera share a
   similar form of colour vision, uniform trichromacy. Yet parsimony
   predicts that the colour vision of Brachyteles will resemble the
   polymorphism present in Lagothrix and Ateles. Here we test this
   assumption. We obtained DNA from the blood or faeces of 18 muriquis and
   sequenced exons 3 and 5 of the M/L opsin gene. Our results affirm the
   existence of a single M/L cone opsin gene in the genus Brachyteles. We
   detected three alleles with predicted lambda(max) values of 530, 550,
   and 562 nm. Two females were heterozygous and are thus predicted to have
   different types of M/L cone pigment. We discuss the implication of this
   result towards understanding the evolutionary ecology of trichromatic
   vision.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of gene dispersal is a fundamental factor of the population
   and evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree species, but directly
   monitoring seed and pollen movement is a difficult task. However,
   indirect estimates of historical gene dispersal can be obtained from the
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations at drift-dispersal
   equilibrium. Using an approach that is based on the slope of the
   regression of pairwise kinship coefficients on spatial distance and
   estimates of the effective population density, we compare indirect gene
   dispersal estimates of sympatric populations of 10 tropical tree
   species. We re-analysed 26 data sets consisting of mapped allozyme, SSR
   (simple sequence repeat), RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) or
   AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) genotypes from two
   rainforest sites in French Guiana. Gene dispersal estimates were
   obtained for at least one marker in each species, although the
   estimation procedure failed under insufficient marker polymorphism,
   limited sample size, or inappropriate sampling area. Estimates generally
   suffered low precision and were affected by assumptions regarding the
   effective population density. Averaging estimates over data sets, the
   extent of gene dispersal ranged from 150 m to 1200 m according to
   species. Smaller gene dispersal estimates were obtained in species with
   heavy diaspores, which are presumably not well dispersed, and in
   populations with high local adult density. We suggest that limited seed
   dispersal could indirectly limit effective pollen dispersal by creating
   higher local tree densities, thereby increasing the positive correlation
   between pollen and seed dispersal distances. We discuss the potential
   and limitations of our indirect estimation procedure and suggest
   guidelines for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Farmed salmon strains have been selected to improve growth rates as well
   as other traits of commercial interest but the 2 million farmed salmon
   escaping annually may enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations
   through genetic and ecological interactions. Here, we compare the
   transcription profiles of 3557 genes in the progeny of farmed and wild
   Atlantic salmon from Norway and Canada grown in controlled conditions,
   and demonstrate that five to seven generations of artificial selection
   led to heritable changes in gene transcription profiles, the average
   magnitude of the differences being 25\% and 18\% for at least 1.4\% and
   1.7\% of the expressed genes in juvenile salmon from Norway and Canada,
   respectively. Moreover, genes showing significant transcription profile
   differences in both farmed strains (16\%) all exhibited parallel
   changes. These findings, along with the identification of several genes
   whose expression profiles were modified through artificial selection,
   provide new insights into the molecular basis of parallel evolution, and
   suggest how gene flow from farmed escapees may affect the genetic

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression reflects the negative consequences of increased
   homozygosity at genes that affect fitness. We investigate inbreeding
   depression in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills (Mandrillus
   sphinx), using high-quality pedigree data, comprising five maternal
   generations and 20 years of morphological and demographic data. We
   examine the relationship between inbreeding coefficients and four
   fitness correlates: two growth parameters (mass and height for age) and
   longevity in both sexes, and age at first conception in females.
   Inbreeding was correlated with both growth parameters, but only in
   females, with inbred females being smaller than noninbred females.
   Inbreeding was also correlated significantly with age at first
   conception, with inbred females giving birth earlier in life than
   noninbred females. We suggest that sex-biased maternal investment may
   explain this sex-differential response to inbreeding, although the lack
   of a significant association between inbreeding and growth in males may
   also be due to the provisioned nature of the colony. The surprising
   relationship between age at first conception and inbreeding may be
   related to smaller adult size in inbred females, or to their being less
   able to escape from male sexual coercion.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which response to environmental change is mediated by
   species-specific ecology is an important aspect of the population
   histories of tropical taxa. During the Pleistocene glacial cycles and
   associated sea level fluctuations, the Sunda region in Southeast Asia
   experienced concurrent changes in landmass area and the ratio of forest
   to open habitat, providing an ideal setting to test the expectation that
   habitat associations played an important role in determining species'
   response to the opportunity for geographic expansion. We used
   mitochondrial control region sequences and six microsatellite loci to
   compare the phylogeographic structure and demographic histories of four
   broadly sympatric species of Old World fruit bats in the genus,
   Cynopterus. Two forest-associated species and two open-habitat
   generalists were sampled along a latitudinal transect in Singapore,
   peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. Contrary to expectations
   based on habitat associations, the geographic scale of population
   structure was not concordant across ecologically similar species. We
   found evidence for long and relatively stable demographic history in one
   forest and one open-habitat species, and inferred non-coincident
   demographic expansions in the second forest and open-habitat species.
   Thus, while these results indicate that Pleistocene climate change did
   not have a single effect on population structure across species, a
   correlation between habitat association and response to environmental
   change was supported in only two of four species. We conclude that
   interactions between multiple factors, including historical and
   contemporary environmental change, species-specific ecology and
   interspecific interactions, have shaped the recent evolutionary
   histories of Cynopterus fruit bats in Southeast Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Two general processes may influence gene flow among populations. One
   involves divergent selection, wherein the maladaptation of immigrants
   and hybrids impedes gene flow between ecological environments (i.e.
   ecological speciation). The other involves geographic features that
   limit dispersal. We determined the relative influence of these two
   processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia
   reticulata). If selection is important, gene flow should be reduced
   between different selective environments. If geography is important,
   gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical
   barriers. We examined how genetic divergence, long-term gene flow, and
   contemporary dispersal within a watershed were influenced by waterfalls,
   geographic distance, predation, and habitat features. We found that
   waterfalls and geographic distance increased genetic divergence and
   reduced dispersal and long-term gene flow. Differences in predation or
   habitat features did not influence genetic divergence or gene flow. In
   contrast, differences in predation did appear to reduce contemporary
   dispersal. We suggest that the standard predictions of ecological
   speciation may be heavily nuanced by the mating behaviour and life
   history strategies of guppies.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate detection of offspring resulting from hybridization between
   individuals of distinct populations has a range of applications in
   conservation and population genetics. We assessed the hybrid
   identification efficiency of two methods (implemented in the
   <smallcapitals>structure</smallcapitals> and
   <smallcapitals>newhybrids</smallcapitals> programs) which are tailored
   to identifying hybrid individuals but use different approaches.
   Simulated first- and second-generation hybrids were used to assess the
   performance of these two methods in detecting recent hybridization under
   scenarios with different levels of genetic divergence and varying
   numbers of loci. Despite the different approaches of the methods, the
   hybrid detection efficiency was generally similar and neither of the two
   methods outperformed the other in all scenarios assessed. Interestingly,
   hybrid detection efficiency was only minimally affected by whether
   reference population allele frequency information was included or not.
   In terms of genotyping effort, efficient detection of F-1 hybrid
   individuals requires the use of 12 or 24 loci with pairwise F-ST between
   hybridizing parental populations of 0.21 or 0.12, respectively. While
   achievable, these locus numbers are nevertheless higher than the number
   of loci currently commonly applied in population genetic studies. The
   method of <smallcapitals>structure</smallcapitals> seemed to be less
   sensitive to the proportion of hybrids included in the sample, while
   <smallcapitals>newhybrids</smallcapitals> seemed to perform slightly
   better when individuals from both backcross and F-1 hybrid classes were
   present in the sample. However, separating backcrosses from purebred
   parental individuals requires a considerable genotyping effort (at least
   48 loci), even when divergence between parental populations is high.}},

Abstract = {{The brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is an endangered
   species in southeastern Australia and many of the remaining populations
   are declining. The steep rocky habitat and shy nature of the species
   make it difficult to obtain data on population parameters such as
   abundance and recruitment. Faecal pellet counts from scat plots are
   commonly used to monitor population trends but these are imprecise and
   difficult to relate to absolute population size. We conducted a
   noninvasive genetic sampling `mark-recapture' study over a 2-year period
   to identify individuals from faecal DNA samples and estimate the
   population size of four brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies located in
   Wollemi National Park, New South Wales. Scat plots in rock-wallaby
   colonies were used as sample collection points for this study. Two
   separate population estimates were carried out for three of the colonies
   to determine if we could detect recruitment and changes in population
   size. We determined that there was one large colony of an estimated 67
   individuals (95\% confidence interval: 55-91) and three smaller
   colonies. Monitoring of the smaller colonies also detected possible
   population size increases in all three. Our results indicate that faecal
   DNA analysis may be a promising method for estimating and monitoring
   population trends in this species particularly when used with a
   traditional field survey method.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic data obtained using faecal DNA were used to elucidate the
   population structure of four brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale
   penicillata) colonies located in Wollemi National Park, New South Wales.
   The results suggested that the four sampled colonies are genetically
   differentiated and do not form a panmictic unit. Based on assignment
   tests, approximately 5\% of sampled individuals were inferred to be
   dispersers and both male and female migrants were detected. Multilocus
   spatial autocorrelation analyses provided evidence for increased
   philopatry among females compared to males within the largest colony in
   the valley. Females in close spatial proximity were more genetically
   similar than expected under a random distribution of females, and
   females separated by more than 400 m were less genetically similar than
   expected. In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant clustering
   of related males. This suggests that within-colony dispersal is male
   biased. We also investigated the best strategies for conserving genetic
   diversity in this population. All of the four sampled colonies were
   found to contain distinct components of the genetic diversity of the
   Wolgan Valley P. penicillata population and loss of any colony is likely
   to result in the loss of unique alleles. Conservation and management
   plans should take into account that these colonies represent genetically
   differentiated discrete subpopulations. This approach is also the best
   strategy for maintaining the genetic diversity of the populations in

Abstract = {{The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is renowned for developing
   resistance to insecticides and causing significant economic damage to
   Brassica vegetable crops throughout the world. Yet despite its economic
   importance, little is known about the population structure and movement
   patterns of this pest both at local and regional scales. In Australia,
   the movement patterns and insecticide resistance status of P. xylostella
   infesting canola, vegetables, forage brassicas and weeds have
   fundamental implications for the management of this pest. Here we use
   six polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate population structure
   and gene flow in Australian populations of P. xylostella. Samples of P.
   xylostella from New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya were also
   scored at these loci. We found no evidence of population structure
   within Australia, with most populations having low inbreeding
   coefficients and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In addition, a sample
   from the North Island of New Zealand was indistinguishable from the
   Australian samples. However, large genetic differences were found
   between the Australia/New Zealand samples and samples from Kenya,
   Malaysia and Indonesia. There was no relationship between genetic
   distance and geographic distance among Australian and New Zealand
   samples. Two of the loci were found to have null alleles, the frequency
   of which was increased in the populations outside the Australia/New
   Zealand region. We discuss these results with reference to insecticide
   resistance management strategies for P. xylostella in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Methods recently developed to infer population structure and admixture
   mostly use individual genotypes described by unlinked neutral markers.
   However, Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria among independent
   markers decline rapidly with admixture time, and the admixture signals
   could be lost in a few generations. In this study, we aimed to describe
   genetic admixture in 182 European wild and domestic cats (Felis
   silvestris), which hybridize sporadically in Italy and extensively in
   Hungary. Cats were genotyped at 27 microsatellites, including 21 linked
   loci mapping on five distinct feline linkage groups. Genotypes were
   analysed with <smallcapitals>structure</smallcapitals> 2.1, a Bayesian
   procedure designed to model admixture linkage disequilibrium, which
   promises to assess efficiently older admixture events using tightly
   linked markers. Results showed that domestic and wild cats sampled in
   Italy were split into two distinct clusters with average proportions of
   membership Q > 0.90, congruent with prior morphological identifications.
   In contrast, free-living cats sampled in Hungary were assigned partly to
   the domestic and the wild cat clusters, with Q < 0.50. Admixture
   analyses of individual genotypes identified, respectively, 5/61 (8\%),
   and 16-20/65 (25-31\%) hybrids among the Italian wildcats and Hungarian
   free-living cats. Similar results were obtained in the past using
   unlinked loci, although the new linked markers identified additional
   admixed wildcats in Italy. Linkage analyses confirm that hybridization
   is limited in Italian, but widespread in Hungarian wildcats, a
   population that is threatened by cross-breeding with free-ranging
   domestic cats. The total panel of 27 loci performed better than the
   linked loci alone in the identification of domestic and known hybrid
   cats, suggesting that a large number of linked plus unlinked markers can
   improve the results of admixture analyses. Inferred recombination events
   led to identify the population of origin of chromosomal segments,
   suggesting that admixture mapping experiments can be designed also in
   wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Achillea (Asteraceae-Anthemideae) offers classical models for speciation
   by hybridization and polyploidy. Here, we test the suspected
   allotetraploid origin of two species, Achillea alpina and Achillea
   wilsoniana between phylogenetically distinct lineages in East Asia. A
   total of 421 AFLP bands from 169 individuals and 19 populations of five
   2x- and two 4x-species were obtained. The data set was analysed with a
   newly developed model that accounts for polyploidy and assumes lack of
   recombination between the parental chromosome sets (i.e. disomic
   inheritance). A. alpina and A. wilsoniana then appear to be
   allotetraploids between Achillea acuminata-2x (sect. Ptarmica) and
   Achillea asiatica-2x (sect. Achillea). The two 4x-species share 44\% and
   48\% of their AFLP bands with A. acuminata-2x, and 39\% and 38\% with A.
   asiatica-2x, respectively. Eight plastid haplotypes (A-H) were detected
   by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (PCR-RFLP) analyses. A. alpina-4x and A. wilsoniana-4x share haplotype F
   only with A. asiatica-2x. This is consistent with the hybrid origin(s)
   involving the latter as the maternal ancestor. This result corroborates
   our previous DNA sequence data, where A. alpina-4x and A. wilsoniana-4x
   are also placed close to A. asiatica-2x. Morphology, ecology, and
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) profiles of the two
   2x-species are distinct, whereas the two 4x-species, grouped as A.
   alpina aggregate, form a nearly continuous link between them.
   Considering all evidence, this 4x-aggregate is regarded as the product
   of a hybridization between genetically distant 2x-ancestors limited to
   China and adjacent areas: one A. acuminata-like, and the other A.
   asiatica-like. The allopolyploid A. alpina agg. exhibits considerable
   morphological variation and ecological flexibility, and has expanded
   throughout eastern Asia and to northern North America, far beyond the
   ranges of their presumed 2x-ancestors.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographical analyses conducted in the Pacific Northwestern United
   States have often revealed concordant patterns of genetic diversity
   among taxa. These studies demonstrate distinct North/South genetic
   discontinuities that have been attributed to Pleistocene glaciation. We
   examined phylogeographical patterns of red tree voles (Phenacomys
   longicaudus) in western Oregon by analysing mitochondrial control region
   sequences for 169 individuals from 18 areas across the species' range.
   Cytochrome b sequences were also analysed from a subset of our samples
   to confirm the presence of major haplotype groups. Phylogenetic network
   analyses suggested the presence of two haplotype groups corresponding to
   northern and southern regions of P. longicaudus' range. Spatial genetic
   analyses (<smallcapitals>samova</smallcapitals> and Genetic Landscape
   Shapes) of control region sequences demonstrated a primary genetic
   discontinuity separating northern and southern sampling areas, while a
   secondary discontinuity separated northern sampling areas into eastern
   and western groups divided by the Willamette Valley. The North/South
   discontinuity likely corresponds to a region of secondary contact
   between lineages rather than an overt barrier. Although the Cordilleran
   ice sheet (maximum similar to 12 000 years ago) did not move southward
   to directly affect the region occupied by P. longicaudus, climate change
   during glaciation fragmented the forest landscape that it inhabits.
   Signatures of historical fragmentation were reflected by positive
   associations between latitude and variables such as Tajima's D and
   patterns associated with location-specific alleles. Genetic distances
   between southern sampling areas were smaller, suggesting that forest
   fragmentation was reduced in southern vs. northern regions.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular variation is often used to infer the demographic history of
   species, but sometimes the complexity of species history can make such
   inference difficult. The willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, shows
   substantially less geographical variation than the chiffchaff,
   Phylloscopus collybita, both in morphology and in mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) divergence. We therefore predicted that the willow warbler
   should harbour less nuclear DNA diversity than the chiffchaff. We
   analysed sequence data obtained from multiple samples of willow warblers
   and chiffchaffs for the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and four nuclear genes.
   We confirmed that the mtDNA diversity among willow warblers is low (pi =
   0.0021). Sequence data from three nuclear genes (CHD-Z, AFLP-WW1 and
   MC1R) not linked to the mitochondria demonstrated unexpectedly high
   nucleotide diversity (pi values of 0.0172, 0.0141 and 0.0038) in the
   willow warbler, on average higher than the nucleotide diversity for the
   chiffchaff (pi values of 0.0025, 0.0017 and 0.0139). In willow warblers,
   Tajima's D analyses showed that the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear
   DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of
   molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep
   affecting the maternally inherited genes. The large nuclear diversity
   seen within willow warblers is not compatible with processes of neutral
   evolution occurring in a population with a constant population size,
   unless the long-term effective population size has been very large (N-e
   > 10(6)). We suggest that the contrasting patterns of genetic diversity
   in the willow warbler may reflect a more complex evolutionary history,
   possibly including historical demographic fluctuations or historical
   male-biased introgression of nuclear genes from a differentiated
   population of Phylloscopus warblers.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In the last 20 years, new species, asexual reproduction, polyploidy and
   hybridization have all been reported within the genus Cobitis. An
   understanding of the current distribution and baseline phylogeographical
   history of `true' nonhybrid Cobitis species is crucial in order to
   unravel these discoveries. In the present work, we investigated the
   phylogeography of the spined loach, Cobitis taenia, using 1126 bp of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 174 individuals collected at 47
   sites. In total, 51 haplotypes that differed at 49 positions (4.35\%)
   were detected. We deduce that C. taenia survived European glaciations in
   at least three refuges in the Ponto-Caspian area. Two of these refuges
   each provided a major lineage that recolonized Europe in separate
   directions: one westward to England and the other spreading north into
   Russia before moving west. A third (minor) lineage that contributed
   little to the recolonization of Europe was also revealed - remaining
   near its Black Sea refuge. However, more recent history was difficult to
   resolve with colonization from a more western refugium during the last
   glacial maximum (LGM) a distinct possibility. Nested clade analysis
   indicates a pattern of restricted gene flow with isolation by distance
   at the first two levels and overall. Unlike many other European
   freshwater fish species, the Danube is not part of the current
   distribution of C. taenia, nor was it used as either a refuge or a
   source of colonization of Europe. Low genetic diversity within C. taenia
   suggests that its colonization of Europe is relatively recent.
   Demographic analyses revealed a history of recent expansion and
   isolation by distance.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary North American drainage basins are composites of formerly
   isolated drainages, suggesting that fragmentation and fusion of
   palaeodrainage systems may have been an important factor generating
   current patterns of genetic and species diversity in stream-associated
   organisms. Here, we combine traditional molecular-phylogenetic,
   multiple-regression, nested clade, and molecular-demographic analyses to
   investigate the relationship between phylogeographic variation and the
   hydrogeological history of eastern North American drainage basins in
   semiaquatic plethodontid salamanders of the Eurycea bislineata species
   complex. Four hundred forty-two sequences representing 1108 aligned
   bases from the mitochondrial genome are reported for the five formally
   recognized species of the E. bislineata complex and three outgroup taxa.
   Within the ingroup, 270 haplotypes are recovered from 144 sampling
   locations. Geographic patterns of mtDNA-haplotype coalescence identify
   13 putatively independent population-level lineages, suggesting that the
   current taxonomy of the group underestimates species-level diversity.
   Spatial and temporal patterns of phylogeographic divergence are strongly
   associated with historical rather than modern drainage connections,
   indicating that shifts in major drainage patterns played a pivotal role
   in the allopatric fragmentation of populations and build-up of lineage
   diversity in these stream-associated salamanders. More generally, our
   molecular genetic results corroborate geological and faunistic evidence
   suggesting that palaeodrainage connections altered by glacial advances
   and headwater erosion occurring between the mid-Miocene and Pleistocene
   epochs explain regional patterns of biodiversity in eastern North
   American streams.}},

Abstract = {{Testing for simultaneous vicariance across comparative phylogeographic
   data sets is a notoriously difficult problem hindered by mutational
   variance, the coalescent variance, and variability across pairs of
   sister taxa in parameters that affect genetic divergence. We simulate
   vicariance to characterize the behaviour of several commonly used
   summary statistics across a range of divergence times, and to
   characterize this behaviour in comparative phylogeographic datasets
   having multiple taxon-pairs. We found Tajima's D to be relatively
   uncorrelated with other summary statistics across divergence times, and
   using simple hypothesis testing of simultaneous vicariance given
   variable population sizes, we counter-intuitively found that the
   variance across taxon pairs in Nei and Li's net nucleotide divergence
   (pi(net)), a common measure of population divergence, is often inferior
   to using the variance in Tajima's D across taxon pairs as a test
   statistic to distinguish ancient simultaneous vicariance from variable
   vicariance histories. The opposite and more intuitive pattern is found
   for testing more recent simultaneous vicariance, and overall we found
   that depending on the timing of vicariance, one of these two test
   statistics can achieve high statistical power for rejecting simultaneous
   vicariance, given a reasonable number of intron loci (> 5 loci, 400 bp)
   and a range of conditions. These results suggest that components of
   these two composite summary statistics should be used in future
   simulation-based methods which can simultaneously use a pool of summary
   statistics to test comparative the phylogeographic hypotheses we
   consider here.}},

Abstract = {{Amanita muscaria sensu lato has a wide geographic distribution,
   occurring in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and North,
   Central and South America. Previous phylogenetic work by others
   indicates three geographic clades (i.e. `Eurasian', `Eurasian-alpine'
   and `North American' groups) within A. muscaria. However, the historical
   dispersal patterns of A. muscaria remained unclear. In our project, we
   collected specimens from arctic, boreal and humid temperate regions in
   Alaska, and generated DNA sequence data from the protein-coding
   beta-tubulin gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large
   subunit (LSU) regions of the ribosomal DNA repeat. Homologous sequences
   from additional A. muscaria isolates were downloaded from GenBank. We
   conducted phylogenetic and nested clade analyses (NCA) to reveal the
   phylogeographic history of the species complex. Although phylogenetic
   analyses confirmed the existence of the three above-mentioned clades,
   representatives of all three groups were found to occur sympatrically in
   Alaska, suggesting that they represent cryptic phylogenetic species with
   partially overlapping geographic distributions rather than being
   allopatric populations. All phylogenetic species share at least two
   morphological varieties with other species, suggesting ancestral
   polymorphism in pileus and wart colour pre-dating their speciations. The
   ancestral population of A. muscaria likely evolved in the
   Siberian-Beringian region and underwent fragmentation as inferred from
   NCA and the coalescent analyses. The data suggest that these populations
   later evolved into species, expanded their range in North America and
   Eurasia. In addition to range expansions, populations of all three
   species remained in Beringia and adapted to the cooling climate.}},

Abstract = {{In many bat species, the opportunity for sperm competition or other
   mechanisms of post-copulatory paternity biasing is thought to be great,
   due to the long delay between copulation and fertilization, demonstrated
   sperm storage capabilities, and observed promiscuity. We present the
   results of the first study to assess whether litters of big brown bats
   (Eptesicus fuscus) containing dizygotic twins share the same father. We
   sampled 26 mother-offspring triads from three colonies in Indiana and
   Illinois, as well as 299 additional adults (237 females and 62 males)
   from these colonies and six other maternity colonies in the same area in
   1997-1998. All individuals were genotyped at nine highly variable
   autosomal microsatellite loci and one X-linked locus. We assessed
   multiple paternity using autosomal and X-linked locus exclusions, and
   using maximum-likelihood methods. All methods confirmed multiple
   paternity within litters, and the maximum-likelihood analyses indicated
   that almost half of the sampled litters were composed of maternal
   half-siblings rather than full-siblings. Our results highlight the
   potential importance of post-copulatory mechanisms of paternity
   determination in the mating system of big brown bats, and have important
   implications for gene flow and population structuring in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The Dutch elm disease fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, which has destroyed
   billions of elm trees worldwide, originally invaded Europe as a series
   of clonal populations with a single mating type (MAT-2) and a single
   vegetative incompatibility (vic) type. The populations then rapidly
   became diverse with the appearance of the MAT-1 type and many vegetative
   incompatibility types. Here, we have investigated the mechanism using
   isolates from sites in Portugal at which the rapid evolution of O.
   novo-ulmi populations from clonality to heterogeneity was well
   established. We show by genetic mapping of vic and MAT loci with AFLP
   markers and by sequence analysis of MAT loci that this diversification
   was due to selective acquisition by O. novo-ulmi of the MAT-1 and vic
   loci from another species, Ophiostoma ulmi. A global survey showed that
   interspecies transfer of the MAT-1 locus occurred on many occasions as
   O. novo-ulmi spread across the world. We discuss the possibility that
   fixation of the MAT-1 and vic loci occurred in response to spread of
   deleterious viruses in the originally clonal populations. The process
   demonstrates the potential of interspecies gene transfer for
   facilitating rapid adaptation of invasive organisms to a new

Abstract = {{The impact of founder events on levels of genetic variation in natural
   populations remains a topic of significant interest. Well-documented
   introductions provide a valuable opportunity to examine how founder
   events influence genetic diversity in invasive species. House finches
   (Carpodacus mexicanus) are passerine birds native to western North
   America, with the large eastern North American population derived from a
   small number of captive individuals released in the 1940s. Previous
   comparisons using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers
   found equivalent levels of diversity in eastern and western populations,
   suggesting that any genetic effects of the founder event were
   ameliorated by the rapid growth of the newly established population. We
   used an alternative marker system, 10 highly polymorphic
   microsatellites, to compare levels of genetic diversity between four
   native and five introduced house finch populations. In contrast to the
   AFLP comparisons, we found significantly lower allelic richness and
   heterozygosity in introduced populations across all loci. Three out of
   five introduced populations showed significant reductions in the ratio
   of the number of alleles to the allele size range, a within-population
   characteristic of recent bottlenecks. Finally, native and introduced
   populations showed significant pairwise differences in allele
   frequencies in every case, with stronger isolation by distance within
   the introduced than native range. Overall, our results provide
   compelling molecular evidence for a founder effect during the
   introduction of eastern house finches that reduced diversity levels at
   polymorphic microsatellite loci and may have contributed to the
   emergence of the Mycoplasma epidemic which recently swept the eastern
   range of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Physical disturbance has often been invoked to control genotypic
   diversity in sessile clonal organisms, yet experimental evidence is
   lacking. I studied the effects of physical disturbance on genet dynamics
   and genotypic diversity in a clonal marine angiosperm, Zostera marina
   (eelgrass). In replicated plots of 1 m(2), the vegetation canopy was
   removed in gaps of zero (control), 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the area (n =
   6 replicates). Before removal and during two consecutive years, the
   genotypic composition was determined using genetic markers (DNA
   microsatellites) in a 5 x 5 pixel grid per plot. An aggregate index of
   genet dynamics summarizing recruitment, increase, loss and decrease of
   clones was maximal at intermediate disturbance levels (quadratic
   polynomial P = 0.02). Physical disturbance also increased the occurrence
   of new genotypes, possibly reflecting recruitment (linear model, P <
   0.05). Contrary to expectations, there was no competitive advantage of
   more heterozygous genotypes over less heterozygous ones. In the absence
   of disturbance, in particular, clones with lower individual
   heterozygosity were more likely to increase in area over a 1-year time
   period than more heterozygous ones, while there was no such correlation
   in plots with disturbance (logistic model, P-disturbance x
   heterozygosity = 0.036). Undisturbed plots revealed background
   recruitment independent of canopy gaps, suggesting that Z. marina
   exhibits a strategy of continual recruitment. Effects of experimental
   disturbance (linear or quadratic) on clonal diversity were not
   detectable. Instead, initial (pretreatment) clonal diversity accounted
   for between 68\% and 91\% of the variance in diversity, indicating
   remarkable resilience of genotypic diversity in the face of physical
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The Florida Everglades have been invaded by an exotic weed fern,
   Lygodium microphyllum. Across its native distribution in the Old World
   tropics from Africa to Australasia it was found to have multiple
   location-specific haplotypes. Within this distribution, the climbing
   fern is attacked by a phytophagous mite, Floracarus perrepae, also with
   multiple haplotypes. The genetic relationship between mite and fern
   haplotypes was matched by an overarching geographical relationship
   between the two. Further, mites that occur in the same location as a
   particular fern haplotype were better able to utilize the fern than
   mites from more distant locations. From a biological control context, we
   are able to show that the weed fern in the Everglades most likely
   originated in northern Queensland, Australia/Papua New Guinea and that
   the mite from northern Queensland offers the greatest prospect for
   control.}},
