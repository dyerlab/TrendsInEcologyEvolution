Abstract = {{The global emergence of the amphibian chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd) is one of the most compelling, and troubling,
   examples of a panzootic. Only discovered in 1998, Bd is now recognized
   as a proximate driver of global declines in amphibian diversity and is
   now widely acknowledged as a key threatening process for this ancient
   class of vertebrates. Moreover, Bd has become a member of a small group
   of highly virulent multihost pathogens that are known to have had
   effects on entire vertebrate communities and the ecosystem-level effects
   of Bd-driven amphibian declines are starting to emerge as a consequence
   of regional decreases in amphibian diversity. Despite the speed at which
   this species of aquatic chytrid has become a focus of research efforts,
   major questions still exist about where Bd originated, how it spreads,
   where it occurs and what are Bd's effects on populations and species
   inhabiting different regions and biomes. In this issue, Goka et al.
   (2009) make an important contribution by publishing the first nationwide
   surveillance for Bd in Asia. Although previous data had suggested that
   amphibians in Asia are largely uninfected by Bd, these surveys were
   limited in their extent and few firm conclusions could be drawn about
   the true extent of infection. Goka et al. herein describe a systematic
   surveillance of Japan for both native and exotic species in the wild, as
   well as amphibians housed in captivity, using a Bd-specific nested PCR
   reaction on a sample of over 2600 amphibians. Their results show that Bd
   is widely prevalent in native species across Japan in at least three of
   the islands that make up the archipelago, proving for the first time
   that Asia harbours Bd.}},

Abstract = {{A serious disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was first found in Japan in December 2006
   in imported pet frogs. This was the first report of chytridiomycosis in
   Asia. To assess the risk of pandemic chytridiomycosis to Japanese frogs,
   we surveyed the distribution of the fungus among captive and wild frog
   populations. We established a nested PCR assay that uses two pairs of
   PCR primers to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a
   ribosomal RNA cassette to detect mild fungal infections from as little
   as 0.001 pg (1 fg) of B. dendrobatidis DNA. We collected swab samples
   from 265 amphibians sold at pet shops, 294 bred at institutes and 2103
   collected at field sites from northern to southwestern Japan. We
   detected infections in native and exotic species, both in captivity and
   in the field. Sequencing of PCR products revealed 26 haplotypes of the
   B. dendrobatidis ITS region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of
   these haplotypes were specific to the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias
   japonicus) and appeared to have established a commensal relationship
   with this native amphibian. Many other haplotypes were carried by alien
   amphibians. The highest genetic diversity of B. dendrobatidis was found
   in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). Some strains of B.
   dendrobatidis appeared to be endemic to Japanese native amphibians, but
   many alien strains are being introduced into Japan via imported
   amphibians. To improve chytridiomycosis risk management, we must
   consider the risk of B. dendrobatidis changing hosts as a result of
   anthropogenic disturbance of the host-specific distribution of the
   fungus.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the relative role of evolutionary processes on genetic
   diversity is critical for understanding species response to climatic
   change. However, many processes, independent of climate, can lead to the
   same genetic pattern. Because effective population size and gene flow
   are affected directly by abundance and dispersal, population ecology has
   the potential to profoundly influence patterns of genetic variation over
   microevolutionary timescales. Here, we use aDNA data and simulations to
   explore the influence of population ecology and Holocene climate change
   on genetic diversity of the Uinta ground squirrel (Spermophilus
   armatus). We examined phylochronology from three modern and two ancient
   populations spanning the climate transitions of the last 3000 years.
   Population genetic analyses based on summary statistics suggest that
   changes in genetic diversity and structure coincided with the Medieval
   Warm Period (MWP), c. 1000 years ago. Serial coalescent simulations
   allowed us to move beyond correlation with climate to statistically
   compare the likelihoods of alternative population histories given the
   observed data. The data best fit source-sink models that include large,
   mid-elevation populations that exchange many migrants and small
   populations at the elevational extremes. While the MWP is likely to have
   reduced genetic diversity, our model-testing approach revealed that
   MWP-driven changes in genetic structure were not better supported for
   the range of models explored. Our results point to the importance of
   species ecology in understanding responses to climate, and showcase the
   use of ancient genetic data and simulation-based inference for
   unraveling the relative roles of microevolutionary processes.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy and precision of four single-sample estimators of effective
   population size, N(e) (heterozygote excess, linkage disequilibrium,
   Bayesian partial likelihood and sibship analysis) were compared using
   empirical data (microsatellite genotypes) from multiple natterjack toad
   (Bufo calamita) populations in Britain (n = 16) and elsewhere in Europe
   (n = 10). Census size data were available for the British populations.
   Because toads have overlapping generations, all of these methods
   estimated the number of effective breeders N(b) rather than N(e). The
   heterozygote excess method only provided results, without confidence
   limits, for nine of the British populations. Linkage disequilibrium gave
   estimates for 10 British populations, but only six had finite confidence
   limits. The Bayesian and sibship methods both produced estimates with
   finite confidence limits for all the populations. Although the Bayesian
   method was the most precise, on most criteria (insensitivity to locus
   number, correlation with other effective and census size estimates and
   correlation with genetic diversity) the sibship method performed best.
   The results also provided evidence of genetic compensation in natterjack
   toads, and highlighted how the relationship between effective size and
   genetic diversity can vary as a function of geographical scale.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophagous insects of the genus Bactrocera are among the most
   economically important invasive fruit fly pests. In 2003, an unknown
   Bactrocera species was found in Kenya. First identified as an `aberrant
   form' of the Asian B. dorsalis complex, it was later recognized as a new
   species, Bactrocera invadens. Within 2 years of its discovery, the
   species was recorded in several African countries, becoming an important
   quarantine pest. As this invasive fly was discovered only recently, no
   data are available on its invasion pattern in Africa. This pilot study
   attempts to infer from genetic data the dynamic aspects of the African
   invasion of this pest. Using microsatellite markers, we evaluated the
   level of genetic diversity and the extent of common ancestry among
   several African populations collected across the invaded areas. A sample
   from the Asian Sri Lankan population was analysed to confirm the Asian
   origin of this pest. Genetic data cast no doubt that Sri Lanka belongs
   to the native range, but only a small percentage of its genotypes can be
   found in Africa. African populations display relatively high levels of
   genetic diversity associated with limited geographical structure and no
   genetic footprints of bottlenecks. These features are indicative of
   processes of rapid population growth and expansion with possible
   multiple introductions. In the span of relatively few years, the African
   invasion registered the presence of at least two uncorrelated outbreaks,
   both starting from the East. The results of the analyses support that
   invasion started in East Africa, where B. invadens was initially
   isolated.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics have helped to
   unveil striking and previously unrecognized patterns of geographic
   genetic structure in marine populations. Largely driven by the pressing
   needs of fisheries management and conservation, studies on marine fish
   populations have played a pivotal role in testing the efficiency of a
   range of approaches to explore connectivity and dispersal at sea. Here,
   we employed nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers and parasitic
   infestations to examine the nature and patterns of population structure
   in a warm-temperate coastal marine teleost across major putative
   biogeographic barriers in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic
   Ocean. We detected deep genetic divergence between mitochondrial
   lineages, likely caused by dramatic climatic and geological
   transformations before and during the Pleistocene. Such long-diverged
   lineages later came into secondary contact and can now be found in
   sympatry. More importantly, microsatellite data revealed that these
   lineages, after millions of years of independent evolution, now
   interbreed extensively. By combining genetic and parasite data, we were

Abstract = {{Discerning patterns of post-establishment spread by invasive species is
   critically important for the design of effective management strategies
   and the development of appropriate theoretical models predicting spatial
   expansion of introduced populations. The globally invasive colonial
   hydrozoan Cordylophora produces propagules both sexually and
   vegetatively and is associated with multiple potential dispersal
   mechanisms, making it a promising system to investigate complex patterns
   of population structure generated throughout the course of rapid range
   expansion. Here, we explore genetic patterns associated with the spread
   of this taxon within the North American Great Lakes basin. We collected
   intensively from eight harbours in the Chicago area in order to conduct
   detailed investigation of local population expansion. In addition, we
   collected from Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, as well as Lake Cayuga
   in the Finger Lakes of upstate New York in order to assess genetic
   structure on a regional scale. Based on data from eight highly
   polymorphic microsatellite loci we examined the spatial extent of clonal
   genotypes, assessed levels of neutral genetic diversity, and explored
   patterns of migration and dispersal at multiple spatial scales through
   assessment of population level genetic differentiation (pairwise F(ST)
   and factorial correspondence analysis), Bayesian inference of population
   structure, and assignment tests on individual genotypes. Results of
   these analyses indicate that Cordylophora populations in this region
   spread predominantly through sexually produced propagules, and that
   while limited natural larval dispersal can drive expansion locally,
   regional expansion likely relies on anthropogenic dispersal vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Despite intense interest in conservation of marine turtles, spatial
   ecology during the oceanic juvenile phase remains relatively unknown.
   Here, we used mixed stock analysis and examination of oceanic drift to
   elucidate movements of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and
   address management implications within the Caribbean. Among samples
   collected from 92 neritic juvenile hawksbills in the Cayman Islands we
   detected 11 mtDNA control region haplotypes. To estimate contributions
   to the aggregation, we performed `many-to-many' mixed stock analysis,
   incorporating published hawksbill genetic and population data. The
   Cayman Islands aggregation represents a diverse mixed stock: potentially
   contributing source rookeries spanned the Caribbean basin, delineating a
   scale of recruitment of 200-2500 km. As hawksbills undergo an extended
   phase of oceanic dispersal, ocean currents may drive patterns of genetic
   diversity observed on foraging aggregations. Therefore, using
   high-resolution Aviso ocean current data, we modelled movement of
   particles representing passively drifting oceanic juvenile hawksbills.
   Putative distribution patterns varied markedly by origin: particles from
   many rookeries were broadly distributed across the region, while others
   would appear to become entrained in local gyres. Overall, we detected a
   significant correlation between genetic profiles of foraging
   aggregations and patterns of particle distribution produced by a
   hatchling drift model (Mantel test, r = 0.77, P < 0.001; linear
   regression, r = 0.83, P < 0.001). Our results indicate that although
   there is a high degree of mixing across the Caribbean (a `turtle soup'),
   current patterns play a substantial role in determining genetic
   structure of foraging aggregations (forming turtle groups). Thus, for
   marine turtles and other widely distributed marine species, integration
   of genetic and oceanographic data may enhance understanding of
   population connectivity and management requirements.}},

Title = {{Interaction of landscape and life history attributes on genetic

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics holds promise for the forecasting of spatial patterns
   of genetic diversity based on key environmental features. Yet, the
   degree to which inferences based on single species can be extended to
   whole communities is not fully understood. We used a pristine and
   spatially structured community of three landlocked salmonids (Salvelinus
   fontinalis, Salmo salar, and Salvelinus alpinus) from Gros Morne
   National Park (Newfoundland, Canada) to test several predictions on the
   interacting effects of landscape and life history variation on genetic
   diversity, neutral divergence, and gene flow (m, migration rate).
   Landscape factors consistently influenced multispecies genetic patterns:
   (i) waterfalls created strong dichotomies in genetic diversity and
   divergence between populations above and below them in all three
   salmonids; (ii) contemporary m decreased with waterway distance in all
   three species, while neutral genetic divergence (theta) increased with
   waterway distance, albeit in only two taxa; (iii) river flow generally
   produced downstream-biased m between populations when waterfalls
   separated these, but not otherwise. In contrast, we expected
   differential life history to result in a hierarchy of neutral divergence
   (S. salar > S. fontinalis > S. alpinus) based on disparities in
   dispersal abilities and population size from previous mark-recapture
   studies. Such hierarchy additionally matched varying degrees of spatial
   genetic structure among species revealed through individual-based
   analyses. We conclude that, whereas key landscape attributes hold power
   to predict multispecies genetic patterns in equivalent communities, they
   are likely to interact with species-specific life history attributes
   such as dispersal, demography, and ecology, which will in turn affect
   holistic conservation strategies.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{4870-4887}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus are potent carcinogens that
   contaminate agricultural crops. Recent efforts to reduce aflatoxin
   concentrations in crops have focused on biological control using
   nonaflatoxigenic A. flavus strains AF36 (=NRRL 18543) and NRRL 21882
   (the active component of afla-guard (R)). However, the evolutionary
   potential of these strains to remain nonaflatoxigenic in nature is
   unknown. To elucidate the underlying population processes that influence
   aflatoxigenicity, we examined patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   spanning 21 regions in the aflatoxin gene cluster of A. flavus. We show
   that recombination events are unevenly distributed across the cluster in
   A. flavus. Six distinct LD blocks separate late pathway genes aflE,
   aflM, aflN, aflG, aflL, aflI and aflO, and there is no discernable
   evidence of recombination among early pathway genes aflA, aflB, aflC,
   aflD, aflR and aflS. The discordance in phylogenies inferred for the
   aflW/aflX intergenic region and two noncluster regions, tryptophan
   synthase and acetamidase, is indicative of trans-species evolution in
   the cluster. Additionally, polymorphisms in aflW/aflX divide A. flavus
   strains into two distinct clades, each harbouring only one of the two
   approved biocontrol strains. The clade with AF36 includes both
   aflatoxigenic and nonaflatoxigenic strains, whereas the clade with NRRL
   21882 comprises only nonaflatoxigenic strains and includes all strains
   of A. flavus missing the entire gene cluster or with partial gene
   clusters. Our detection of LD blocks in partial clusters indicates that
   recombination may have played an important role in cluster disassembly,
   and multilocus coalescent analyses of cluster and noncluster regions
   indicate lineage-specific gene loss in A. flavus. These results have
   important implications in assessing the stability of biocontrol strains
   in nature.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones are often characterized by narrow, coincident clines for
   diverse traits, suggesting that little introgression occurs across them.
   However, this pattern may result from a bias in focussing on traits that
   are diagnostic of parental populations. Such choice of highly
   differentiated traits may cause us to overlook differential
   introgression in nondiagnostic traits and to distort our perception of
   hybrid zones. We tested this hypothesis in an avian hybrid zone by
   comparing cline structure in two sets of molecular markers: isozyme and
   restriction fragment length polymorphism markers chosen for
   differentiation between parental forms, and microsatellite markers
   chosen for polymorphism. Two cline-fitting methods showed that cline
   centre positions of microsatellite alleles were more variable than those
   of isozyme and restriction fragment length polymorphism markers, and
   several were significantly shifted from those of the diagnostic markers.
   Cline widths of microsatellite alleles were also variable and two- to
   eightfold wider than those of the diagnostic markers. These patterns are
   consistent with the idea that markers chosen for differentiation are
   more likely to be under purifying selection, and studies focussed on
   these markers will underestimate overall introgression across hybrid
   zones. Our results suggest that neutral and positively selected alleles
   may introgress freely across many hybrid zones without altering
   perceived boundaries between hybridizing forms.}},

Abstract = {{To test our hypothesis of hybrid formation involving the `independent
   gametophyte' phenomenon in ferns, we identified the genomic formulae and
   ploidy level of gametophytes of the Vandenboschia radicans complex at
   the periphery of a sporophyte population. We identified haploid
   gametophytes of V. kalamocarpa (one of the two putative parents of
   V.xstenosiphon) in a hybrid sporophyte population in Japan that lacks
   fertile non-hybrid individuals. Furthermore, diploid sporophytes of the
   species were not found within a 50-km radius. This finding supports a
   hypothesis of hybridization involving the `independent gametophyte'
   phenomenon and provides a new perspective on the geographical
   distribution of fern hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Divergent natural selection is often thought to be the principal factor
   driving phenotypic differentiation between populations. We studied two
   ecotypes of the aquatic isopod Asellus aquaticus which have diverged in
   parallel in several Swedish lakes. In these lakes, isopods from reed
   belts along the shores colonized new stonewort stands in the centre of
   the lakes and rapid phenotypic changes in size and pigmentation followed
   after colonization. We investigated if selection was likely to be
   responsible for these observed phenotypic changes using indirect
   inferences of selection (F-ST-Q(ST) analysis). Average Q(ST) for seven
   quantitative traits were higher than the average F-ST between ecotypes
   for putatively neutral markers (AFLPs). This suggests that divergent
   natural selection has played an important role during this rapid
   diversification. In contrast, the average Q(ST) between the different
   reed ecotype populations was not significantly different from the mean
   F-ST. Genetic drift could therefore not be excluded as an explanation
   for the minor differences between allopatric populations inhabiting the
   same source habitat. We complemented this traditional F-ST-Q(ST)
   approach by comparing the F-ST distributions across all loci (n = 67-71)
   with the Q(ST) for each of the seven traits. This analysis revealed that
   pigmentation traits had diverged to a greater extent and at higher
   evolutionary rates than size-related morphological traits. In
   conclusion, this extended and detailed type of F-ST-Q(ST) analysis
   provides a powerful method to infer adaptive phenotypic divergence
   between populations. However, indirect inferences about the operation of
   divergent selection should be analyzed on a per-trait basis and
   complemented with detailed ecological information.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis lyrata is mostly outcrossing due to a sporophytic
   self-incompatibility (SI) system but around the Great Lakes of North
   America some populations have experienced a loss of SI. We researched
   the loss of SI in a phylogeographic context. We used cpDNA and
   microsatellite markers to test if populations of North-American A.
   lyrata around the Great Lakes have experienced different (recent)
   histories, and linked this with individually established selfing
   phenotype and population level realized outcrossing rates calculated
   based on variation in progeny arrays at multi-locus microsatellite
   markers. We found three chloroplast haplotypes, in two of which the loss
   of self-incompatibility had occurred independently. Shifts to high rates
   of inbreeding were most apparent in one of these lineages but
   individuals showing loss of SI occurred in all three. Self-compatible
   individuals usually showed a reduction of observed heterozygosity (H(O))
   compared to outcrossing individuals. In the lineage that included the
   populations with the highest levels of inbreeding, this reduction was
   more substantial. This may indicate that the loss of SI in this lineage
   did not occur as recently as in the other lineage. The geographic
   distribution of the haplotypes suggested that there had been at least
   two independent colonization routes to the north of the Great Lakes
   following the last glaciation. This is consistent with postglacial
   migration patterns that have been suggested for other organisms with
   limited dispersal, such as reptiles and amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{Asplenium fontanum subsp. fontanum and A. petrarchae subsp. bivalens are
   diploid rock ferns of limestone outcrops of the western Mediterranean
   region. Asplenium fontanum subsp. fontanum occurs from Valencia through
   northeastern Spain to the Alpes-Maritimes and Swiss Jura. Asplenium
   petrarchae subsp. bivalens occurs only on Majorca, in Valencia and
   possibly in southern Spain. We analysed allozyme and chloroplast genetic
   marker diversity in 75 populations of A. fontanum subsp. fontanum and 12
   populations of A. petrarchae subsp. bivalens sampled from across their
   respective ranges. The two species show similar levels of species and
   population genetic diversity to one another and to other diploid
   European Asplenium taxa. Both are predominantly outbreeding, as
   indicated by F(IS) = 0.108 and 0.167 respectively. Substantial
   between-population differentiation results largely from differentiation
   between regions. Isolation by distance operates over limited geographic
   ranges, up to 50 km. In A. fontanum subsp. fontanum, the major
   geographical differentiation between Valencia and the rest of the taxon
   range probably represents an ancient range fragmentation. A less
   pronounced differentiation divides populations in the SW from those in
   the NE of the range, with evidence for a biogeographic link between the
   eastern Pyrenees and southeastern France. High diversity in the Pyrenees
   may either represent ancient population differentiation, or a suture
   zone. In A. petrarchae subsp. bivalens, populations on Majorca exhibit a
   subset of the genetic diversity present in Valencia, although the two
   regions are strongly differentiated by differing allele frequencies.
   Dispersal from the mainland may have founded Majorcan populations,
   although a role for in situ island survival cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), females laying eggs in the nest of
   other `host' females of the same species, is a common alternative
   reproductive tactic among birds. For hosts there are likely costs of
   incubating and rearing foreign offspring, but costs may be low in
   species with precocial chicks such as waterfowl, among which CBP is
   common. Waterfowl show strong female natal philopatry, and spatial
   relatedness among females may influence the evolution of CBP. Here we
   investigate fine-scale kin structure in a Baltic colony of barnacle
   geese, Branta leucopsis, estimating female spatial relatedness using
   protein fingerprints of egg albumen, and testing the performance of this
   estimator in known mother-daughter pairs. Relatedness was significantly
   higher between neighbour females (nesting < 40 metres from each other)
   than between females nesting farther apart, but there was no further
   distance trend in relatedness. This pattern may be explained by earlier
   observations of females nesting close to their mother or brood sisters,
   even when far from the birth nest. Hosts and parasites were on average
   not more closely related than neighbour females. In 25 of 35 sampled
   parasitized nests, parasitic eggs were laid after the host female
   finished laying, too late to develop and hatch. Timely parasites, laying
   eggs in the host's laying sequence, had similar relatedness to hosts as
   that between neighbours. Females laying late parasitic eggs tended to be
   less related to the host, but not significantly so. Our results suggest
   that CBP in barnacle geese might represent different tactical
   life-history responses.}},

Abstract = {{Offspring quality may benefit from genetic dissimilarity between
   parents. However, genetic dissimilarity may trade-off with additive
   genetic benefits. We hypothesized that when sexual selection produces
   sex-specific selective scenarios, the relative benefits of additive
   genetic vs. dissimilarity may differ for sons and daughters. Here we
   study a sample of 666 red deer (Cervus elaphus) microsatellite
   genotypes, including males, females and their foetuses, from 20 wild
   populations in Spain (the main analyses are based on 241 different
   foetuses and 190 mother-foetus pairs). We found that parental lineages
   were more dissimilar in daughters than in sons. On average, every mother
   was less related to her mate than to the sample of fathers in the
   population when producing daughters not sons. Male foetuses conceived
   early in the rutting season were much more inbred than any other
   foetuses. These differences maintained through gestation length, ruling
   out intrauterine mortality as a cause for the results, and indicating
   that the potential mechanism producing the association between parents'
   dissimilarity and offspring sex should operate close to mating or
   conception time. Our findings highlight the relevance of considering the
   sex of offspring when studying genetic similarity between parents.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of plants in the wild are distributed spatially in patches,
   the boundaries of which may occur and change because of a complicated
   interplay between myriad environmental stressors and limitations of, or
   constraints on, plant coping mechanisms. By examining genetic variation
   and co-variation among marker-inferred inbred lines and sib-families of
   an upland wild mustard species within and just a few meters across a
   natural patch boundary, we show that the evolution of tolerance to the
   stressful environment outside the patch may be constrained by allocation
   to glucosinolate compounds (GS) that are defensive against generalist
   insect herbivores. Several potential stressors were associated with the
   patch boundary, but carbon isotope ratios indicated that sib-families
   with smaller stomatal apertures maintained performance better in
   response to late season dry conditions, suggesting that drought was an
   important stressor. The presence of GS may help explain the
   characteristic patchy distribution of mustards, a relatively diverse and
   important plant family. This result challenges one end of the continuum
   of the long-standing Plant Apparency hypothesis, which essentially
   states the opposite causation, that low molecular weight toxins like GS
   are evolutionary responses of patchy distributions and correlated
   life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid accumulation of genomic data has led to an explosion of
   studies searching for signals of past selection left within DNA
   sequences. Yet the majority of theoretical studies investigating the
   traces of selection have assumed a simple form of selection, without
   interactions among selectively fixed sites. Fitness
   interactions-'epistasis'-are commonplace, however, and take on a myriad
   of forms (Whitlock et al. 1995; Segreet al. 2005; Phillips 2008). It is
   thus important to determine how such epistasis would influence selective
   sweeps. On p. 5018 of this issue, Takahasi (2009) explores the effect of
   epistasis on genetic variation neighbouring two sites that interact in
   determining fitness, finding that such epistasis has a dramatic impact
   on the genetic variability in regions surrounding the interacting sites.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolutionary interactions between plants and their associated
   pollinators and seed dispersers are thought to have promoted the
   diversification of flowering plants (Raven 1977; Regal 1977; Stebbins
   1981). The actual mechanisms by which pollinators could drive species
   diversification in plants are not fully understood. However, it is
   thought that pollinator host specialization can influence the evolution
   of reproductive isolation among plant populations because the
   pollinator's choice of host is what determines patterns of gene flow in
   its host plant, and host choice may also have important consequences on
   pollinator and host fitness (Grant 1949; Bawa 1992). In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Smith et al. (2009) present a very interesting study
   that addresses how host specialization affects pollinator fitness and
   patterns of gene flow in a plant host. Several aspects of this study
   match elements of a seminal mathematical model of plant-pollinator
   codivergence (Kiester et al. 1984) suggesting that reciprocal selection
   for matched plant and pollinator reproductive traits may lead to
   speciation in the host and its pollinator when there is strong host
   specialization and a pattern of geographic subdivision. Smith et al.'s
   study represents an important step to fill the gap in our understanding
   of how reciprocal selection may lead to speciation in coevolved
   plant-pollinator mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{The accessibility of new genomic resources, high-throughput molecular
   technologies and analytical approaches such as genome scans have made
   finding genes contributing to fitness variation in natural populations
   an increasingly feasible task. Once candidate genes are identified, we
   argue that it is necessary to take a mechanistic approach and work up
   through the levels of biological organization to fully understand the
   impacts of genetic variation at these candidate genes. We demonstrate
   how this approach provides testable hypotheses about the causal links
   among levels of biological organization, and assists in designing
   relevant experiments to test the effects of genetic variation on
   phenotype, whole-organism performance capabilities and fitness. We
   review some of the research programs that have incorporated mechanistic
   approaches when examining naturally occurring genetic and phenotypic
   variation and use these examples to highlight the value of developing a
   comprehensive understanding of the relationship between genotype and
   fitness. We give suggestions to guide future research aimed at
   uncovering and understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and argue
   that further integration of mechanistic approaches will help molecular
   ecologists better understand the evolution of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to novel environments arises either from new beneficial
   mutations or by utilizing pre-existing genetic variation. When standing
   variation is used as the source of new adaptation, fitness effects of
   alleles may be altered through an environmental change. Alternatively,
   changes in epistatic genetic backgrounds may convert formerly neutral
   mutations into beneficial alleles in the new genetic background. By
   extending the coalescent theory to describe the genealogical histories
   of two interacting loci, I here investigated the hitchhiking effect of
   epistatic selection on the amount and pattern of sequence diversity at
   the linked neutral regions. Assuming a specific form of epistasis
   between two new mutations that are independently neutral, but together
   form a coadapted haplotype, I demonstrate that the footprints of
   epistatic selection differ markedly between the interacting loci
   depending on the order and relative timing of the two mutational events,
   even though both mutations are equally essential for the formation of an
   adaptive gene combination. Our results imply that even when neutrality
   tests could detect just a single instance of adaptive substitution,
   there may, in fact, be numerous other hidden mutations that are left
   undetected, but still play indispensable roles in the evolution of a new
   adaptation. We expect that the integration of the coalescent framework
   into the general theory of polygenic inheritance would clarify the
   connection between factors driving phenotypic evolution and their
   consequences on underlying DNA sequence changes, which should further
   illuminate the evolutionary foundation of coadapted systems.}},

Abstract = {{The marine environment provides an opportunity to examine population
   structure in species with high dispersal capabilities and often no
   obvious barriers to genetic exchange. In coastal waters of the western
   North Atlantic, common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, are a
   highly mobile species with a continuous distribution from New York to
   Florida. We examine if the highly mobile nature coupled with no obvious
   geographic barriers to movement in this region result in a large
   panmictic population. Mitochondrial control region sequences and 18
   microsatellite loci indicate dolphins are partitioning the habitat both
   latitudinally and longitudinally. A minimum of five genetically
   differentiated populations were identified among 404 samples collected
   in the range of New Jersey to northern Florida using both genetic marker
   types, some inhabiting nearshore coastal waters and others utilizing
   inshore estuarine waters. The genetic results reject the hypothesis of a
   single stock of coastal bottlenose dolphins put forth after the
   1987-1988 epizootic that caused a large-scale die-off of dolphins and
   suggest instead the disease vector was transferred from one population
   to the next as a result of seasonal migratory movements of some
   populations. These coastal Atlantic populations also differ
   significantly from bottlenose dolphin samples collected in coastal
   waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico, implying a long-term barrier to
   movement between the two basins.}},

Abstract = {{A population's neutral genetic variation is a composite of its size,
   degree of isolation and demographic history. Bottlenecks and founder
   events increase genetic drift, leading to the loss of genetic variation
   and increased genetic differentiation among populations. Gene flow has
   the opposite effects. Thus, gene flow can override the genetic patterns
   caused by founder events. Using 37 microsatellite loci, we investigated
   the effects of serial bottlenecks on genetic variation and
   differentiation among 42 Alpine ibex populations in Switzerland with
   known re-introduction histories. We detected a strong footprint of
   re-introduction events on contemporary genetic structure, with
   re-introduction history explaining a substantial part of the genetic
   differentiation among populations. As a result of the translocation of a
   considerable number of individuals from the sole formerly surviving
   population in northern Italy, most of the genetic variation of the
   ancestral population is now present in the combined re-introduced Swiss
   populations. However, re-introductions split up the genetic variation
   among populations, such that each contemporary Swiss population showed
   lower genetic variation than the ancestral population. As expected,
   serial bottlenecks had different effects on the expected heterozygosity
   (He) and standardized number of alleles (sNa). While loss of sNa was
   higher in the first bottlenecks than in subsequent ones, He declined to
   a similar degree with each bottleneck. Thus, genetic drift was detected
   with each bottleneck, even when no loss of sNa was observed. Overall,
   more than a hundred years after the beginning of this successful
   re-introduction programme, re-introduction history was the main
   determinant of today's genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive ant species Wasmannia auropunctata displays both
   ecologically dominant and non-dominant populations within its native
   range. Three factors could theoretically explain the ecological
   dominance of some native populations of W. auropunctata: (i) its clonal
   reproductive system, through demographic and/or adaptive advantages;
   (ii) its unicolonial social organization, through lower intraspecific
   and efficient interspecific competition; (iii) the human disturbance of
   its native range, through the modification of biotic and abiotic
   environmental conditions. We used microsatellite markers and behavioural
   tests to uncover the reproductive modes and social organization of
   dominant and non-dominant native populations in natural and
   human-modified habitats. Microsatellite and mtDNA data indicated that
   dominant and non-dominant native populations (supercolonies as
   determined by aggression tests) of W. auropunctata did not belong to
   different evolutionary units. We found that the reproductive system and
   the social organization are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain
   W. auropunctata ecological dominance. Dominance rather seems to be set
   off by unknown ecological factors altered by human activities, as all
   dominant populations were recorded in human-modified habitats. The
   clonal reproductive system found in some populations of W. auropunctata
   may however indirectly contribute to its ecological dominance by
   allowing the species to expand its environmental niche, through the
   fixation over time of specific combinations of divergent male and female
   genotypes. Unicoloniality may rather promote the range expansion of
   already dominant populations than actually trigger ecological dominance.
   The W. auropunctata model illustrates the strong impact of human
   disturbance on species' ecological features and the adaptive potential
   of clonal reproductive systems.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic assignment methods provide an appealing approach for
   characterizing dispersal patterns on ecological time scales, but require
   sufficient genetic differentiation to accurately identify migrants and a
   large enough sample size of migrants to, for example, compare dispersal
   between sexes or age classes. We demonstrate that assignment methods can
   be rigorously used to characterize dispersal patterns in a marbled
   murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) population from central California
   that numbers approximately 600 individuals and is only moderately
   differentiated (F-ST similar to 0.03) from larger populations to the
   north. We used coalescent simulations to select a significance level
   that resulted in a low and approximately equal expected number of type I
   and II errors and then used this significance level to identify a
   population of origin for 589 individuals genotyped at 13 microsatellite
   loci. The proportion of migrants in central California was greatest
   during winter when 83\% of individuals were classified as migrants
   compared to lower proportions during the breeding (6\%) and
   post-breeding (8\%) seasons. Dispersal was also biased toward young and
   female individuals, as is typical in birds. Migrants were rarely members
   of parent-offspring pairs, suggesting that they contributed few young to
   the central California population. A greater number of migrants than
   expected under equilibrium conditions, a lack of individuals with mixed
   ancestry, and a small number of potential source populations (two),
   likely allowed us to use assignment methods to rigorously characterize
   dispersal patterns for a population that was larger and less
   differentiated than typically thought required for the identification of
   migrants.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, the neutral genetic relatedness of natural
   populations of Trichostrongylid nematodes was investigated in relation
   to polymorphism of the beta-tubulin gene, which is selected for
   anthelminthic treatments. The aim of the study was to assess the
   contribution of several evolutionary processes: migration and genetic
   drift by neutral genetic markers and selection by anthelminthic
   treatments on the presence of resistance alleles at beta-tubulin. We
   studied two nematode species (Teladorsagia circumcincta and Haemonchus
   contortus) common in temperate climatic zones; these species are
   characterized by contrasting life history traits. We studied 10 isolated
   populations of goat nematode parasites: no infected adult goat had been
   exchanged after the herds were established. Beta-tubulin polymorphism
   was similar in these two species. One and two beta-tubulin alleles from
   T. circumcincta and H. contortus respectively were shared by several
   populations. Most of the beta-tubulin alleles were `private' alleles. No
   recombination between alleles was detected in BZ-resistant alleles from
   T. circumcincta and H. contortus. The T. circumcincta populations have
   not diverged much since their isolation (F(ST) < 0.08), whereas H.
   contortus displayed marked local genetic differentiation (F(ST) ranging
   from 0.08 to 0.18). These findings suggest that there are severe
   bottlenecks in the H. contortus populations, possibly because of their
   reduced abundance during unfavourable periods and their high
   reproductive rate, which allows the species to persist even after severe
   population reduction. Overall, the data reported contradict the
   hypothesis of the origin of beta-tubulin resistance alleles in these
   populations from a single mutational event, but two other hypotheses
   (recurrent mutation generating new alleles in isolated populations and
   the introduction of existing alleles) emerge as equally likely.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Most of the work on the impact of elevated temperature and light on
   Symbiodinium-invertebrate symbioses have focused primarily on how the
   photosynthetic (algal) partner is impacted. Understanding how the same
   stresses affect the invertebrate host, however, is in its infancy. In
   this study, we re-examined the direct effect of elevated temperatures on
   the invertebrate host exploring the early transcriptional response of
   aposymbiotic (without algal symbionts) coral larvae. The temperatures
   tested in the experimental design were 24 degrees C (ambient seawater
   temperature), 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C; and the sampling points
   were 3 and 10 h after temperature exposure. We explored relative changes
   in transcription using a cDNA microarray constructed for the
   scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora, and containing 18 142 expressed
   sequence tag (EST) clones/8386 unigenes. Our study identified 29 genes
   that were significantly up- and down-regulated when A. millepora coral
   larvae were exposed to elevated temperatures. Down-regulation of several
   key components of DNA/RNA metabolism was detected implying inhibition of
   general cellular processes. The down-regulation of protein synthesis,
   however, was not simple and random, which suggested that the stress
   response was a more complicated adjustment of cellular metabolism. We
   identified four significant outcomes during the very early hours of the
   transcriptional response to hyperthermal stress in coral larvae. First,
   the expression of heat-shock proteins increased rapidly (within 3 h) in
   response to hyperthermal stress. Second, a fluorescent protein
   homologue, DsRed-type FP, decreased its expression in response to
   elevated temperature reinforcing a potential role as a molecular marker
   for monitoring hyperthermal stress in nature. Third, the down-regulation
   of a coral mannose-binding C-type lectin under elevated temperature
   suggests that heat stress might compromise some components of the coral
   immune defence and therefore might bring about susceptibility to
   pathogenic diseases. And last, genes involved in protecting cells
   against oxidative stress showed little response at the early hours to
   heat stress, supporting the proposal that up-regulation of cnidarian
   host oxidative stress genes may require reactive oxygen species
   generated by stressed algal symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated a major geographic break in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   haplotypes in deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, by analysing spatial
   variation in a 491-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region from 455
   samples distributed across a north-south transect of 2000 km in Western
   North America. To determine whether the mtDNA break was reflected in the
   nuclear genome, we then compared spatial variation in 13 nuclear
   microsatellites of 95 individuals surrounding the mtDNA break. Using a
   canonical correlation analysis we found that nuclear genomic variation
   was not correlated with mtDNA differentiation. The contrasting patterns
   of variation in mtDNA and nuclear DNA are consistent with a hypothesis
   of historic genetic drift that occurred in isolated refugia combined
   with recent gene flow between the formerly isolated refugial
   populations. A Mantel test of genetic vs. geographic distance revealed
   that recent gene flow between deer mouse populations has been high. We
   conclude that past vicariant events associated with Pleistocene climate
   changes together with recent gene flow have created the observed
   intra-specific cytonuclear discordance in Western North America.}},

Abstract = {{The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) severely restricted forest ecosystems on
   New Zealand's South Island, but the extent of LGM distribution for
   forest species is still poorly understood. We used mitochondrial DNA
   phylogeography (COI) and ecological niche modelling (ENM) to identify
   LGM refugia for the mycophagous beetle Agyrtodes labralis (Leiodidae), a
   forest edge species widely distributed in the South Island. Both the
   phylogenetic analyses and the ENM indicate that A. labralis refuged in
   Kaikoura, Nelson, and along much of the South Island's west coast.
   Phylogeography of this species indicates that recolonization of the
   largely deforested east and southeast South Island occurred in a
   west-east direction, with populations moving through the Southern Alps,
   and that the northern refugia participated little in interglacial
   population expansion. This contradicts published studies of other New
   Zealand species, in which recolonization occurs in a north-south fashion

Abstract = {{Pleistocene glaciations often resulted in differentiation of taxa in
   southern European peninsulas, producing the high levels of endemism
   characteristic of these regions (e.g. the Iberian Peninsula). Despite
   their small ranges, endemic species often exhibit high levels of
   intraspecific differentiation as a result of a complex evolutionary
   history dominated by successive cycles of fragmentation, expansion and
   subsequent admixture of populations. Most evidence so far has come from
   the study of species with an Atlantic distribution in northwestern
   Iberia, and taxa restricted to Mediterranean-type habitats remain poorly
   studied. The Iberian Midwife toad (Alytes cisternasii) is a
   morphologically conserved species endemic to southwestern and central
   Iberia and a typical inhabitant of Mediterranean habitats. Applying
   highly variable genetic markers from both mitochondrial and nuclear
   genomes to samples collected across the species' range, we found
   evidence of high population subdivision within A. cisternasii.
   Mitochondrial haplotypes and microsatellites show geographically
   concordant patterns of genetic diversity, suggesting population
   fragmentation into several refugia during Pleistocene glaciations
   followed by subsequent events of geographical and demographic expansions
   with secondary contact. In addition, the absence of variation at the
   nuclear beta-fibint7 and Ppp3caint4 gene fragments suggests that
   populations of A. cisternasii have been recurrently affected by episodes
   of extinction and recolonization, and that documented patterns of
   population subdivision are the outcome of recent and multiple refugia.
   We discuss the evolutionary history of the species with particular
   interest in the increasing relevance of Mediterranean refugia for the
   survival of genetically differentiated populations during the
   Pleistocene glaciations as revealed by studies in co-distributed taxa.}},

Abstract = {{A major question in our understanding of eukaryotic biodiversity is
   whether small bodied taxa have cosmopolitan distributions or consist of
   geographically localized cryptic taxa. Here, we explore the global
   phylogeography of the freshwater cladoceran Polyphemus pediculus
   (Linnaeus, 1761) (Crustacea, Onychopoda) using two mitochondrial genes,
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16s ribosomal RNA, and one nuclear
   marker, 18s ribosomal RNA. The results of neighbour-joining and Bayesian
   phylogenetic analyses reveal an exceptionally pronounced genetic
   structure at both inter- and intra-continental scales. The presence of
   well-supported, deeply divergent phylogroups across the Holarctic
   suggests that P. pediculus represents an assemblage of at least nine,
   largely allopatric cryptic species. Interestingly, all phylogenetic
   analyses support the reciprocal paraphyly of Nearctic and Palaearctic
   clades. Bayesian inference of ancestral distributions suggests that P.
   pediculus originated in North America or East Asia and that European
   lineages of Polyphemus were established by subsequent intercontinental
   dispersal events from North America. Japan and the Russian Far East
   harbour exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity at both regional
   and local scales. In contrast, little genetic subdivision is apparent
   across the formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America, areas
   that historical demographic analyses suggest that were recolonized just
   5500-24 000 years ago.}},

Abstract = {{In ant-plant protection mutualisms, plants provide nesting space and
   nutrition to defending ants. Several plant-ants are polygynous.
   Possessing more than one queen per colony can reduce nestmate
   relatedness and consequently the inclusive fitness of workers. Here, we
   investigated the colony structure of the obligate acacia-ant
   Pseudomyrmex peperi, which competes for nesting space with several
   congeneric and sympatric species. Pseudomyrmex peperi had a lower colony
   founding success than its congeners and thus, appears to be
   competitively inferior during the early stages of colony development.
   Aggression assays showed that P. peperi establishes distinct, but highly
   polygynous supercolonies, which can inhabit large clusters of host
   trees. Analysing queens, workers, males and virgin queens from two
   supercolonies with eight polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed a
   maximum of three alleles per locus within a colony and, thus, high
   relatedness among nestmates. Colonies had probably been founded by one
   singly mated queen and supercolonies resulted from intranidal mating
   among colony-derived males and daughter queens. This strategy allows
   colonies to grow by budding and to occupy individual plant clusters for
   time spans that are longer than an individual queen's life. Ancestral
   states reconstruction indicated that polygyny represents the derived
   state within obligate acacia-ants. We suggest that the extreme polygyny
   of Pseudomyrmex peperi, which is achieved by intranidal mating and
   thereby maintains high nestmate relatedness, might play an important
   role for species coexistence in a dynamic and competitive habitat.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in mating patterns is poorly known in
   wind-pollinated plant species. Here, we analysed mating patterns of the
   wind-pollinated dioecious shrub Pistacia lentiscus by genotyping 904
   seeds from 30 mother plants with eight microsatellite markers in a
   high-density population in two consecutive flowering seasons. We found
   significant differences in some mating system estimates between years,
   particularly in the levels of correlated paternity. Overall,
   within-mothers correlated paternity was higher in 2007 than in 2006
   (r(pWM) = 0.085 and 0.030), which translated into an effective number of
   fathers (N(ep)) of 11.8 and 33.6 respectively. Using a smoothing
   interpolation technique, we show that the effective pollen cloud was
   spatially structured in patches of high- and low-genetic diversity,
   which do not remain constant from year to year. In 2006, the
   among-mothers correlated paternity (r(pAM)) showed no trend with
   distance, suggesting no restriction of pollen dispersal. However, in
   2007, r(pAM) was greater than zero at short distances, revealing the
   existence of small-scale patterns of pollen dispersal. The fact that the
   studied seasons were climatically homogeneous during the flowering time
   suggested that the observed differences might be ascribed to
   between-year phenological variation of individuals in the studied
   population or other (unknown) factors. Numerical simulations, based on
   the real data set, indicated that the clumping of males and decreasing
   plant density, which is related to different types of pollen limitation,
   greatly increase correlated mating in this wind-pollinated species,
   which is of relevance under the frame of the continuous anthropogenic
   habitat disturbance suffered by Mediterranean ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological divergence has a central role in speciation and is therefore
   an important source of biodiversity. Studying the micro-evolutionary
   processes of ecological diversification at its early stages provides an
   opportunity for investigating the causative mechanisms and ecological
   conditions promoting divergence. Here we use morphological traits,
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios and tooth wear to characterize two
   disparate types of North Atlantic killer whale. We find a highly
   specialist type, which reaches up to 8.5 m in length and a generalist
   type which reaches up to 6.6 m in length. There is a single fixed
   genetic difference in the mtDNA control region between these types,
   indicating integrity of groupings and a shallow divergence. Phylogenetic
   analysis indicates this divergence is independent of similar ecological
   divergences in the Pacific and Antarctic. Niche-width in the generalist
   type is more strongly influenced by between-individual variation rather
   than within-individual variation in the composition of the diet. This
   first step to divergent specialization on different ecological resources
   provides a rare example of the ecological conditions at the early stages
   of adaptive radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolution between flowering plants and their pollinators is thought to
   have generated much of the diversity of life on Earth, but the
   population processes that may have produced these macroevolutionary
   patterns remain unclear. Mathematical models of coevolution in obligate
   pollination mutualisms suggest that phenotype matching between plants
   and their pollinators can generate reproductive isolation. Here, we test
   this hypothesis using a natural experiment that examines the role of
   natural selection on phenotype matching between yuccas and yucca moths
   (Tegeticula spp.) in mediating reproductive isolation between two
   varieties of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia var. brevifolia and Y.
   brevifolia var. jaegeriana). Using passive monitoring techniques, DNA
   barcoding, microsatellite DNA genotyping, and sibship reconstruction, we
   track host specificity and the fitness consequences of host choice in a
   zone of sympatry. We show that the two moth species differ in their
   degree of host specificity and that oviposition on a foreign host plant
   results in the production of fewer offspring. This difference in host
   specificity between the two moth species mirrors patterns of chloroplast
   introgression from west to east between host varieties, suggesting that
   natural selection acting on pollinator phenotypes mediates gene flow and
   reproductive isolation between Joshua-tree varieties.}},

Abstract = {{Our curiosity about biodiversity compels us to reconstruct the
   evolutionary past of species. Molecular evolutionary theory now allows
   parameterization of mathematically sophisticated and detailed models of
   DNA evolution, which have resulted in a wealth of phylogenetic
   histories. But reconstructing how species and population histories have
   played out is critically dependent on the assumptions we make, such as
   the clock-like accumulation of genetic differences over time and the
   rate of accumulation of such differences. An important stumbling block
   in the reconstruction of evolutionary history has been the discordance
   in estimates of substitution rate between phylogenetic and
   pedigree-based studies. Ancient genetic data recovered directly from the
   past are intermediate in time scale between phylogenetics-based and
   pedigree-based calibrations of substitution rate. Recent analyses of
   such ancient genetic data suggest that substitution rates are closer to
   the higher, pedigree-based estimates. In this issue, Navascues \&
   Emerson (2009) model genetic data from contemporary and ancient
   populations that deviate from a simple demographic history (including
   changes in population size and structure) using serial coalescent
   simulations. Furthermore, they show that when these data are used for
   calibration, we are likely to arrive at upwardly biased estimates of
   mutation rate.}},

Abstract = {{House mice are extra-ordinary animals -extra-ordinary in the literal
   sense of that word. They are pests - but also a valued laboratory
   animal. They are generalized rodents - and successful in habitats from
   tundra to tropics and from sea-level to high altitudes. They have
   differentiated into a perplexity of taxa, yet differ little in their
   general morphology. They were long scorned by ecologists as recently
   arrived commensals, but are increasingly illuminating evolutionary
   processes as new techniques are applied to their study. Local forms,
   once valued only by taxonomists, are proving ever more interesting as
   their genetics are probed. In 1992, Mathias \& Mira described the
   apparently unexciting characteristics of mice living on the two main
   islands of the Madeira group, 600 km west of continental Portugal. Then
   in 2000, Britton-Davidian et al. discovered that there were at least six
   chromosomal (Robertsonian) races on the main island. In the past decade,
   studies of molecular and mitochondrial genomes have shown an array of
   variables and posed questions about the origins and subsequent evolution
   of these island mice. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Forster et al.
   report on the mtDNA haplotypes found on the island and in mainland
   Portugal, discuss the probable source of the island colonizers, and
   consider data which might give information about the timing of the
   colonizing event(s).}},

Abstract = {{Yogi Berra is often credited{*} with having opined that `prediction is
   very difficult, especially about the future'. There is no discipline for
   which this statement holds with more force than invasion biology, where
   it has been historically very challenging to predict the fate of
   introduced species (Williamson 2006). Some species after introduction
   quickly go extinct. Other relatively similar species may persist, but
   with little spread from their initial beachheads. Yet others can become
   aggressive invaders, with devastating consequences for native
   communities and ecosystems. This lack of predictability may of course
   sometimes reflect a simple lack of knowledge, both about key features of
   a species' basic biology, and about the environmental and community
   milieu in which invasion occurs (Williamson 2006). However,
   unpredictability may also arise from a fundamental fact about
   populations of living organisms - they almost always contain genetic
   variation, and so are not fixed entities responding to an environmental
   template, but instead labile in how they cope with the environment, over
   many spatial and temporal scales. Chance vicissitudes in the
   origination, maintenance and spatial organization of genetic variation
   could play a large role in generating the observed unpredictability in
   the fates of introduced species. The degree to which a particular
   introduced species becomes `invasive'- to the extent of coming to the
   attention of worried land managers, governmental officials and the
   public - may reflect in part its capacity for adaptive evolution across
   a wide range of environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Amorpha georgiana (Fabaceae) is an endangered legume species found in
   longleaf pine savannas in the Southeastern United States. Approximately
   900 individuals and 14 populations remain, most of which are
   concentrated in North Carolina. Eleven microsatellite loci were used to
   explore genetic diversity, population structure and recent population
   bottlenecks using genotypic data from 132 individuals collected at ten
   different localities. Although A. georgiana is quite rare, it exhibited
   high levels of genetic diversity (17.7 alleles/locus; H(o) = 0.65, H(E)
   = 0.75). Most of the genetic variation was found within rather than
   between populations of this species. The single remaining Georgia
   population was well differentiated from populations of the Carolinas
   (F(ST) > 0.1), which had weaker structure among them (F(ST) < 0.1). Only
   a geographically disjunct population showed strong evidence of a recent
   population bottleneck, perhaps due to a recent founder event.
   Hybridization with A. herbacea was also detected. For conservation
   management plans, A. georgiana populations in each geographic region
   (North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia) plus a disjunct population
   in North Carolina (Holly Shelter) should be treated as separate
   management units for which in situ conservation, including habitat
   restoration and use of prescribed burns, should ensure persistence of
   this species and preservation of its evolutionary potential.}},

Abstract = {{Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive weed in western North
   America found primarily growing at elevations less than 2200 m. We asked
   whether cheatgrass is capable of becoming adapted to a marginal habitat,
   by investigating a population at a high elevation invasion edge. We used
   a combination of methods, including reciprocal field transplants,
   controlled environment studies and molecular analysis. High levels of
   SSR gene diversity (0.50 vs. 0.43) and comparable variation in
   phenotypic traits were observed at both the invasion edge and a low
   elevation, high-density population. Three heterozygotes were observed in
   the edge population, which is unusual in this predominantly
   self-pollinating plant. Plants from high elevations germinated more
   slowly in a growth chamber and had slower seedling growth rates.
   Survivorship was low at the edge (13\%), compared with the low elevation
   site (55\%), but surviving plants were of similar size and had
   equivalent reproductive output. Seed size positively affected survival
   and plant performance in the field and this trait was inherited.
   Emergence timing affected survival at the low elevation site and
   germination timing was also inherited. Local adaptation was seen in the
   low, rather than in the high elevation site, because of differential
   survival. While there was no evidence for local adaptation to the high
   elevation site observed in the field, family level and genotype-level
   differences in traits that affected field performance, high genetic
   diversity at the invasion edge, and evidence of outcrossing in this
   highly selfing species indicates that the potential for adaptation to a
   marginal habitat exists within this population.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in many invasive species shows little or no signs of a
   founder event, suggesting that high genetic diversity may facilitate
   establishment success. The rocky-shore, plankton-feeding cichlid fish
   Cynotilapia afra is endemic to Lake Malawi, but naturally absent from
   many suitable sites. In the 1960s, this species was introduced to the
   southern areas of the lake, presumably as a result of the aquarium fish
   trade. It has now become established on a number of rocky areas within
   the Lake Malawi National Park. Here, we analysed DNA sequence variation
   in the mitochondrial control region of six native and four introduced
   populations of C. afra, and three populations of the closely-related and
   hybridizing Pseudotropheus zebra. In contrast to previous studies of
   Lake Malawi rock dwelling cichlids, network analyses suggested that
   native populations of C. afra showed high levels of lineage sorting in
   mtDNA. Introduced populations showed higher sequence and haplotype
   diversity than their native counterparts. Our analyses suggested that
   the elevated gene diversity was largely attributed to the fact that the
   introduced C. afra populations were derived from several genetically
   distinct and geographically separate populations, and to a lesser extent
   because of introgressive hybridization with native P. zebra. The
   establishment and spread of C. afra may be partly because of its ability
   to occupy a vacant ecological niche, but it may also have been
   facilitated by its enhanced genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing ability to extract and sequence DNA from
   noncontemporaneous tissue offers biologists the opportunity to analyse
   ancient DNA (aDNA) together with modern DNA (mDNA) to address the
   taxonomy of extinct species, evolutionary origins, historical
   phylogeography and biogeography. Perhaps more exciting are recent
   developments in coalescence-based Bayesian inference that offer the
   potential to use temporal information from aDNA and mDNA for the
   estimation of substitution rates and divergence dates as an alternative
   to fossil and geological calibration. This comes at a time of growing
   interest in the possibility of time dependency for molecular rate
   estimates. In this study, we provide a critical assessment of Bayesian
   Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for the estimation of
   substitution rate using simulated samples of aDNA and mDNA. We conclude
   that the current models and priors employed in Bayesian MCMC analysis of
   heterochronous mtDNA are susceptible to an upward bias in the estimation
   of substitution rates because of model misspecification when the data
   come from populations with less than simple demographic histories,
   including sudden short-lived population bottlenecks or pronounced
   population structure. However, when model misspecification is only mild,
   then the 95\% highest posterior density intervals provide adequate
   frequentist coverage of the true rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we analysed spatial genetic structure (SGS) patterns and
   estimated dispersal distances in Milicia excelsa (Welw.) C.C. Berg
   (Moraceae), a threatened wind-pollinated dioecious African tree, with
   typically low density (similar to 10 adults/km2). Eight microsatellite
   markers were used to type 287 individuals in four Cameroonian
   populations characterized by different habitats and tree densities.
   Differentiation among populations was very low. Two populations in more
   open habitat did not display any correlation between genetic relatedness
   and spatial distance between individuals, whereas significant SGS was
   detected in two populations situated under continuous forest cover. SGS
   was weak with a maximum S(p)-statistic of 0.006, a value in the lower
   quartile of SGS estimates for trees in the literature. Using a stepwise
   approach with Bayesian clustering methods, we demonstrated that SGS
   resulted from isolation by distance and not colonization by different
   gene pools. Indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances ranged from
   sigma(g) = 1 to 7.1 km, one order of magnitude higher than most
   estimates found in the literature for tropical tree species. This result
   can largely be explained by life-history traits of the species. Milicia
   excelsa exhibits a potentially wide-ranging wind-mediated pollen
   dispersal mechanism as well as very efficient seed dispersal mediated by
   large frugivorous bats. Estimations of gene flow suggested no major risk
   of inbreeding because of reduction in population density by
   exploitation. Different strategy of seed collection may be required for
   reforestation programmes among populations with different extent of SGS.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of sharks and other upper-trophic marine predators has sparked
   worldwide concern for the stability of ocean ecosystems. The grey nurse
   (ragged-tooth or sand tiger) shark (Carcharias taurus) is Vulnerable on
   a global scale, Critically Endangered in Australia and presumed extinct
   in parts of its historical range. We used 193 muscle and fin samples
   collected from six extant populations to assess global mtDNA and
   microsatellite diversity and the degree of global population genetic
   structure. Control region mtDNA diversity was low in every population,
   and two populations (eastern Australia and Japan) contained only a
   single mtDNA haplotype. Genetic signatures of recent losses of genetic
   variation were not yet apparent at microsatellite loci, indicating that
   this low mtDNA variation is not a result of anthropogenic population
   declines. Population differentiation was substantial between each
   population pair except Brazil and South Africa, F(ST) values ranged from
   0.050 to 0.699 and 0.100 to 1.00 for microsatellite and mitochondrial
   data respectively. Bayesian analysis clearly partitioned individuals
   into five of the populations from which they were sampled. Our data
   imply a low frequency of immigrant exchange among each of these regions
   and we suggest that each be recognized as a distinct evolutionary
   significant unit. In contrast to pelagic species such as whale shark and
   white shark that may cross ocean basins and where cooperative
   international efforts are necessary for conservation, grey nurse shark,
   like many coastal species, need to be managed regionally.}},

Abstract = {{The basidiomycetous fungus Onnia tomentosa is one of the most widespread
   root rot pathogens in North America. Although the disease is more severe
   on spruce and pine trees, this pathogen can infect several coniferous
   species. To study the population structure of O. tomentosa, we harvested
   180 basidiocarps in a 45-year-old white spruce plantation in western
   Quebec in autumn 1997 and extracted DNA directly from individual
   basidiocarps. Using a combination of spatial coordinates and molecular
   data based on the analysis of two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci,
   we measured the average genet size and molecular diversity and assessed
   the relative contribution of basidiospores and vegetative growth to the
   stand colonization. Most of the sampled basidiocarps that clustered
   spatially belonged to the same genet. A total of 37 discrete multilocus
   genets of an average size of 3.42 m were obtained. The genet size
   distribution was skewed towards smaller genets (< 3 m) that displayed
   higher diversity than the larger genets (> 3 m). The nuclear loci were
   in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the larger genets, but not in the
   smaller genets, which displayed a deficiency of heterozygotes. This
   suggests a Wahlund effect, whereby different colonization events
   resulted in expected heterozygosity higher than observed heterozygosity.
   Using an estimate of the growth rate of the fungus, only a few of the
   largest genets were approximately the age of the plantation. These
   observations are consistent with the colonization by basidiospores
   subsequent to site preparation and tree planting followed by secondary
   colonization events and vegetative spread.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The drastic shift from pelagic larvae to benthic adult form that occurs
   during marine invertebrate metamorphosis is often induced by intimate
   interactions between settling larvae and their benthic environment.
   Larval experience prior to and during metamorphosis can significantly
   affect adult fitness, but it is presently unknown whether the exact
   nature of the inductive cue is an experience that matters, or by what
   mechanism such carry-over effects are mediated. Here we test for
   carry-over effects of the specific nature of inductive cues on gene
   expression in metamorphosing postlarvae of the tropical abalone,
   Haliotis asinina. Postlarvae induced by three different species of
   coralline algae all successfully undergo metamorphosis, yet the
   expression profiles of 11 of 17 metamorphosis-related genes differ
   according to which species of algae the larvae settled upon.
   Significantly, several genes continue to be differentially expressed for
   at least 40 h after removal of the algae from the postlarvae, clearly
   demonstrating a carry-over effect of inductive cue on gene expression.
   We observe a carryover effect in several genes with varying functions
   and spatial expression patterns, indicating that each algal species
   impacts global gene expression in a unique manner. These data
   unexpectedly reveal that transcriptional modulation of
   metamorphosis-related genes is contingent upon the precise composition
   of the benthic microenvironment experienced directly at induction of
   settlement, and highlight transcription as a mechanism that can mediate
   between larval and postlarval experiences. For new recruits into an
   abalone population, metamorphosis clearly does not represent a new
   transcriptional beginning.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological interactions are an important source of rapid evolutionary
   change and thus may generate a significant portion of novel
   biodiversity. Such changes may be particularly prevalent in parasites,
   where hosts can induce strong selection for adaptation. To understand
   the relative frequency at which host-associated divergences occur, it is
   essential to examine the evolutionary history of the divergence process,
   particularly when it is occurring over large geographical scales where
   both geographical and host-associated isolation may playa part. In this
   study, we use population genetics and phylogeography to study the
   evolutionary history of host-associated divergence in the seabird tick
   Ixodes uriae (Acari, Ixodidae). We compare results from microsatellite
   markers that reflect more ecological timescales with a conserved
   mitochondrial gene (COIII) that reflects more ancient divergence events.
   Population structure based on microsatellites showed clear evidence of
   host-associated divergence in all colonies examined. However, isolated
   populations of the same host type did not always group together in
   overall analyses and the genetic differentiation among sympatric host
   races was highly variable. In contrast, little host or geographical
   structure was found for the mitochondrial gene fragment. These results
   suggest that host race formation in I. uriae is a recent phenomenon,
   that it may have occurred several times and that local interactions are
   at different points in the divergence process. Rapid divergence in I.
   uriae implies a strong interaction with its local host species, an
   interaction that will alter the ecological dynamics of the system and
   modify the epidemiological landscape of circulating micropathogens.}},

Abstract = {{The pied flycatcher is one of the most phenotypically variable bird
   species in Europe. The geographic variation in phenotypes has often been
   attributed to spatial variation in selection regimes that is associated
   with the presence or absence of the congeneric collared flycatcher.
   Spatial variation in phenotypes could however also be generated by
   spatially restricted gene flow and genetic drift. We examined the
   genetic population structure of pied flycatchers across the breeding
   range and applied the phenotypic Q(ST) (P(ST))-F(ST) approach to detect
   indirect signals of divergent selection on dorsal plumage colouration in
   pied flycatcher males. Allelic frequencies at neutral markers were found
   to significantly differ among populations breeding in central and
   southern Europe whereas northerly breeding pied flycatchers were found
   to be one apparently panmictic group of individuals. Pairwise
   differences between phenotypic (P(ST)) and neutral genetic distances
   (F(ST)) were positively correlated after removing the most
   differentiated Spanish and Swiss populations from the analysis,
   suggesting that genetic drift may have contributed to the observed
   phenotypic differentiation in some parts of the pied flycatcher breeding
   range. Differentiation in dorsal plumage colouration however greatly
   exceeded that observed at neutral genetic markers, which indicates that
   the observed pattern of phenotypic differentiation is unlikely to be
   solely maintained by restricted gene flow and genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{The colonization history of Madeiran house mice was investigated by
   analysing the complete mitochondrial (mt) D-loop sequences of 156 mice
   from the island of Madeira and mainland Portugal, extending on previous
   studies. The numbers of mtDNA haplotypes from Madeira and mainland
   Portugal were substantially increased (17 and 14 new haplotypes
   respectively), and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the previously
   reported link between the Madeiran archipelago and northern Europe.
   Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four mtDNA lineages in
   mainland Portugal, of which one was particularly common and widespread
   (termed the `Portugal Main Clade'). There was no support for population
   bottlenecks during the formation of the six Robertsonian chromosome
   races on the island of Madeira, and D-loop sequence variation was not
   found to be structured according to karyotype. The colonization time of
   the Madeiran archipelago by Mus musculus domesticus was approached using
   two molecular dating methods (mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline
   plot). Time estimates based on D-loop sequence variation at mainland
   sites (including previously published data from France and Turkey) were
   evaluated in the context of the zooarchaeological record of M. m.
   domesticus. A range of values for mutation rate (mu) and number of mouse
   generations per year was considered in these analyses because of the
   uncertainty surrounding these two parameters. The colonization of
   Portugal and Madeira by house mice is discussed in the context of the
   best-supported parameter values. In keeping with recent studies, our
   results suggest that mutation rate estimates based on interspecific
   divergence lead to gross overestimates concerning the timing of recent
   within-species events.}},

Abstract = {{Natural genetic breaks may indicate limitations to gene flow or the
   presence of contact zones of previously isolated populations. Molecular
   evidence suggests that genetic breaks have aggregated in distinct
   geographical areas. We propose a new application of well-established
   statistical methods for analysing multilocus genetic data to identify
   intraspecific genetic breaks. The methodological approach combines
   Bayesian clustering with a spatially explicit maximum-difference
   algorithm to visualize and quantify breaks between clusters. We used
   amplified fragment length polymorphism data of two co-distributed,
   silicicolous alpine plant species, Geum montanum and Geum reptans,
   exhaustively sampled on a consistent, regular grid over their entire
   range of the European Alps and the Carpathians. We found a distinct and
   highly similar allocation of genetic breaks in both species. The pattern
   of breaks did not conform to scenarios of glacial refugial survival,
   alternatively in peripheral refugia or on nunataks, as expected because
   of the species' ecologies (late-successional low alpine vs.
   early-successional high alpine). Our findings rather substantiated the
   postulate of a general pattern of genetic breaks in alpine plants and
   corresponded well with biogeographical regions formerly described. Our
   approach could serve as a tool not only for landscape genetics and
   comparative phylogeography, but also for floristics or faunistics to
   compare biogeographic with phylogeographic breaks.}},

Abstract = {{We examined multiple paternity during eight breeding events within a
   10-year period (1995-2005) for a total of 114 wild American alligator
   nests in Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in south-west Louisiana. Our goals
   included examining (i) within population variation in multiple paternity
   among years, (ii) variation in multiple paternity in individual females
   and (iii) the potential for mate fidelity. To accomplish this, in the
   current study, eggs were sampled from 92 nests over 6 years and analysed
   along with 22 nests from a previous 2-year study. Genotypes at five
   microsatellite loci were generated for 1802 alligator hatchlings.
   Multiple paternity was found in 51\% of clutches and paternal
   contributions to these clutches were highly skewed. Rates of multiple
   paternity varied widely among years and were consistently higher in the
   current study than previously reported for the same population. Larger
   females have larger clutches, but are not more likely to have multiply
   sired nests. However, small females are unlikely to have clutches with
   more than two sires. For 10 females, nests from multiple years were
   examined. Seven (70\%) of these females exhibited long-term mate
   fidelity, with one female mating with the same male in 1997, 2002 and
   2005. Five females exhibiting partial mate fidelity (71\%) had at least
   one multiple paternity nest and thus mated with the same male, but not
   exclusively. These patterns of mate fidelity suggest a potential role
   for mate choice in alligators.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which genetic diversity is lost from inbred populations is
   important for conservation biology, evolutionary ecology, and plant and
   animal breeding. This importance stems from the fact that the amount of
   genetic diversity a population has is expected to correlate with
   evolutionary potential. A population's ability to avert extinction
   during rapidly changing environmental conditions, or the magnitude of
   response to selection on a trait, depend on the ability of the genome to
   maintain potentially adaptive genetic variation in the face of random
   genetic drift. Although a few previous studies have demonstrated that
   the rate of inbreeding affects the amount of genetic diversity
   maintained, the elegant work of Demontis et al., in this issue, clearly
   demonstrates that slow inbreeding maintains more genetic diversity than
   fast inbreeding and that the primary mechanism could be balancing
   selection. In their study, populations that took 19 generations, rather
   than one generation, to reach the same level of inbreeding maintained
   10\% higher levels of allelic richness and 25\% higher levels of
   heterozygosity. The use of specifically chosen molecular markers not
   expected to be neutral makes this study especially noteworthy, as the
   study provides evidence concerning the mechanisms underlying the
   maintenance of genetic diversity in the face of inbreeding.}},

   between hosts and pathogens in the wild is more complex. As such,
   identifying selective agents and understanding underlying
   co-evolutionary mechanisms remains a major challenge. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Evans \& Neff (2009) characterized spatial and
   temporal variation in the bacterial parasite community infecting Chinook
   salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry from five populations in British
   Columbia, Canada. They used a 16S rDNA sequencing-based approach to
   examine the prevalence of bacterial infection in kidney and looked for
   associations with MHC class I and II genetic variability. The authors
   found a high diversity of bacteria infecting fry, albeit at low
   prevalence. It was reasoned that spatial variability in infection rate
   and bacterial community phylogenetic similarity found across populations
   may represent differential pathogen-mediated selection pressures. The
   study revealed some evidence of heterozygote advantage at MHC class II,
   but not class I, and preliminary associations between specific MHC
   alleles and bacterial infections were uncovered. This research adds an
   interesting perspective to the debate on host-pathogen co-evolutionary
   mechanisms and emphasizes the importance of considering the complexity
   of pathogen communities in studies of host local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{A major drawback of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) as
   genetic makers for phylogeographic studies is their lack of a temporal
   dimension. In a recent publication in Molecular Ecology, Kropf et al.
   (2009) proposed a molecular clock for AFLP. In this comment we evaluate
   the proposed approach both theoretically and empirically. A linear
   increase with time is a prerequisite to use a genetic distance as
   molecular clock. Testing the relationship between genetic distance and
   time in the data of Kropf et al. (2009) for linearity revealed that the
   relationship was in fact not linear for their pooled data, as well as
   for one of the three species analyzed. Also, the relationship was not
   linear in two new species, where divergence times could be inferred from
   macrofossils. When applying the proposed molecular clock to data from
   eight species, dates obtained were plausible in some cases, but very
   improbable in others. The suggested genetic distance was also influenced
   by intrapopulation genetic diversity, leading to a potential bias. In
   the future, investigations of AFLP mutation rates combined with
   phylogeographic modelling may contribute to adding a time scale to the
   understanding of AFLP data.}},

Abstract = {{In two studies on mating patterns and spatial components of pollen and
   seed dispersal of Prunus mahaleb based on parentage analysis, Garcia et
   al. (2005, 2007) depicted their 196 focal trees as a spatially isolated
   population where all reproductive trees had been genotyped. Additional
   distributional data for P. mahaleb trees in their study area, however,
   revealed that Garcia and colleagues' depiction of their study system
   bears little resemblance to reality. The trees these authors studied did
   not form a discrete, geographically isolated population. Around 300
   ungenotyped reproductive trees occurred within the 1.5-km distributional
   gap to the nearest population proclaimed by Garcia and colleagues. Since
   exhaustive sampling of potential parental genotypes is essential in
   parentage analyses, the occurrence of a large number of ungenotyped
   trees in the immediate neighbourhood of focal trees can severely affect
   the main conclusions of Garcia et al. (2005, 2007) as well as of several
   related publications on gene dispersal and mating patterns of P. mahaleb
   conducted on the same trees and relying on the same false premises of
   spatial isolation and exhaustive sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, mitochondrial DNA has been the most popular
   marker of molecular diversity, for a combination of technical
   ease-of-use considerations, and supposed biological and evolutionary
   properties of clonality, near-neutrality and clock-like nature of its

   that mitochondrial DNA is not always clonal, far from neutrally evolving
   and certainly not clock-like, questioning its relevance as a witness of
   recent species and population history. We critically evaluate the usage
   of mitochondrial DNA for species delineation and identification.
   Finally, we note the great potential of accumulating mtDNA data for
   evolutionary and functional analysis of the mitochondrial genome.}},

Title = {{Efficiency of selection, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphism

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is often hypothesized that slow inbreeding causes less inbreeding
   depression than fast inbreeding at the same absolute level of
   inbreeding. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the more
   efficient purging of deleterious alleles and more efficient selection
   for heterozygote individuals during slow, when compared with fast,
   inbreeding. We studied the impact of inbreeding rate on the loss of
   heterozygosity and on morphological traits in Drosophila melanogaster.
   We analysed five noninbred control lines, 10 fast inbred lines and 10
   slow inbred lines; the inbred lines all had an expected inbreeding
   coefficient of approximately 0.25. Forty single nucleotide polymorphisms
   in DNA coding regions were genotyped, and we measured the size and shape
   of wings and counted the number of sternopleural bristles on the
   genotyped individuals. We found a significantly higher level of genetic
   variation in the slow inbred lines than in the fast inbred lines. This
   higher genetic variation was resulting from a large contribution from a
   few loci and a smaller effect from several loci. We attributed the
   increased heterozygosity in the slow inbred lines to the favouring of
   heterozygous individuals over homozygous individuals by natural
   selection, either by associative over-dominance or balancing selection,
   or a combination of both. Furthermore, we found a significant polynomial
   correlation between genetic variance and wing size and shape in the fast
   inbred lines. This was caused by a greater number of homozygous
   individuals among the fast inbred lines with small, narrow wings, which
   indicated inbreeding depression. Our results demonstrated that the same
   amount of inbreeding can have different effects on genetic variance
   depending on the inbreeding rate, with slow inbreeding leading to higher
   genetic variance than fast inbreeding. These results increase our
   understanding of the genetic basis of the common observation that slow
   inbred lines express less inbreeding depression than fast inbred lines.
   In addition, this has more general implications for the importance of
   selection in maintaining genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation, i.e., the reduction of populations into small
   isolated remnants, is expected to increase spatial genetic structure
   (SGS) in plant populations through nonrandom mating, lower population
   densities and potential aggregation of reproductive individuals. We
   investigated the effects of population size reduction and genetic
   isolation on SGS in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) using a
   combined experimental and simulation approach. Maritime pine is a
   wind-pollinated conifer which has a scattered distribution in the
   Iberian Peninsula as a result of forest fires and habitat fragmentation.
   Five highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellites were genotyped in a
   total of 394 individuals from two population pairs from the Iberian
   Peninsula, formed by one continuous and one fragmented population each.
   In agreement with predictions, SGS was significant and stronger in
   fragments (Sp = 0.020 and Sp = 0.026) than in continuous populations,
   where significant SGS was detected for one population only (Sp = 0.010).
   Simulations suggested that under fat-tailed dispersal, small population
   size is a stronger determinant of SGS than genetic isolation, while
   under normal dispersal, genetic isolation has a stronger effect. SGS was
   always stronger in real populations than in simulations, except if
   unrealistically narrow dispersal and/or high variance of reproductive
   success were modelled (even when accounting for potential overestimation
   of SGS in real populations as a result of short-distance sampling). This
   suggests that factors such as nonrandom mating or selection not
   considered in the simulations were additionally operating on SGS in
   Iberian maritime pine populations.}},

   forests and from the ornamental plant-trade. Seven microsatellite
   markers revealed 82 multilocus genotypes (MGs) of which only three were
   abundant (> 10\%). Iteratively collapsing based upon minimum Theta(ST),
   yielded five meta-samples and five singleton populations. Populations in
   the same meta-sample were geographically contiguous, with one exception,
   possibly explained by the trade of infected plants from the same source
   into different locations. Multidimensional scaling corroborated this
   clustering and identified nursery populations as genetically most
   distant from the most recent outbreaks. A minimum-spanning network
   illustrated the evolutionary relationships among MGs, with common
   genotypes at the centre and singletons at the extremities; consistent
   with colonization by a few common genotypes followed by local evolution.
   Coalescent migration analyses used the original data set and a data set
   in which local genotypes were collapsed into common ancestral genotypes.
   Both analyses suggested that meta-samples 1 (Santa Cruz County) and 3
   (Sonoma and Marin Counties), act as sources for most of the other
   forests. The untransformed data set best explains the first phases of
   the invasion, when the role of novel genotypes may have been minimal,
   whereas the second analysis best explains migration patterns in later
   phases of the invasion, when prevalence of novel genotypes was likely to
   have become more significant. Using this combined approach, we discuss
   possible migration routes based on our analyses, and compare them to
   historical and field observations from several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative genetic structure of hosts and their parasites has
   important implications for their coevolution, but has been investigated
   in relatively few systems. In this study, we analysed the genetic
   structure and diversity of the New Zealand intertidal snail Zeacumantus
   subcarinatus (n = 330) and two of its trematode parasites, Maritrema
   novaezealandensis (n = 269) and Philophthalmus sp. (n = 246), using
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences. Snails and
   trematodes were examined from 11 collection sites representing three
   regions on the South Island of New Zealand. Zeacumantus subcarinatus
   displayed low genetic diversity per geographic locality, strong genetic
   structure following an isolation by distance pattern, and low migration
   rates at the scale of the study. In contrast, M. novaezealandensis
   possessed high genetic diversity, genetic homogeneity among collection
   sites and high migration rates. Genetic diversity and migration rates
   were typically lower for Philophthalmus sp. compared to M.
   novaezealandensis and it displayed weak to moderate genetic structure.
   The observed patterns likely result from the limited dispersal ability
   of the direct developing snail and the utilization of bird definitive
   hosts by the trematodes. In addition, snails may occasionally experience
   long-distance dispersal. Discrepancies between trematode species may
   result from differences in their effective population sizes and/or life
   history traits.}},

Abstract = {{Positive correlations between individual genetic heterozygosity and
   fitness-related traits (HFCs) have been observed in organisms as diverse
   as plants, marine bivalves, fish or mammals. HFCs are not universal and
   the strength and stability of HFCs seem to be variable across species,
   populations and ages. We analysed the relationship between individual
   genetic variability and two different estimators of fitness in natural
   samples of European eel, growth rate (using back-calculated
   length-at-age 1, 2 and 3) and parasite infestation by the swimbladder
   nematode Anguillicola crassus. Despite using a large data set of 22
   expressed sequence tags-derived microsatellite loci and a large sample
   size of 346 individuals, no heterozygote advantage was observed in terms
   of growth rate or parasite load. The lack of association was evidenced
   by (i) nonsignificant global HFCs, (ii) a Multivariate General Linear
   Model showing no effect of heterozygosity on fitness components, (iii)
   single-locus analysis showing a lower number of significant tests than
   the expected false discovery rate, (iv) sign tests showing only a
   significant departure from expectations at one component, and, (v) a
   random distribution of significant single-locus HFCs that was not
   consistent across fitness components or sampling sites. This contrasts
   with the positive association observed in farmed eels in a previous
   study using allozymes, which can be explained by the nature of the
   markers used, with the allozyme study including many loci involved in
   metabolic energy pathways, while the expressed sequence tags-linked
   microsatellites might be located in genes or in the proximity of genes

Title = {{Female-biased dispersal under conditions of low male mating competition
   in a polygynous mammal}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Sex-biased dispersal is a common phenomenon in birds and mammals.
   Competition for mates has been argued to be an important selective
   pressure favouring dispersal. Sexual differences in the level of
   intrasexual competition may produce asymmetries in the costs-benefits
   balance of dispersal and philopatry for males and females, which may
   favour male-biased dispersal in polygynous species such as most mammals.
   This being the case, condition-dependent dispersal predicts that
   male-bias should decrease if mating competition relaxes. We test this
   expectation for red deer, where male-biased dispersal is the norm. In
   southwestern Spain, red deer populations located in nonfenced hunting
   estates presented altered structures with sex ratio strongly biased to
   females and high proportion of young males. As a consequence, mate
   competition in these populations was lower than in other, most typical
   red deer populations. We found that, under such conditions of altered
   population structure, dispersal was female-biased rather than
   male-biased. Additionally, mate competition positively related to male
   dispersal but negatively to female dispersal. Other factors such as
   resource competition, age of individuals and sex ratio were not related
   to male or female dispersal. Males may not disperse if intrasexual
   competition is low and then females may disperse as a response to male
   philopatry. We propose hypotheses related to female mate choice to
   explain female dispersal under male philopatry. The shift of the
   sex-biased dispersal pattern along the gradient of mate competition
   highlights its condition-dependence as well as the interaction between
   male and female dispersal in the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{The major histocompatability complex (MHC) is a multigene family of
   receptors that bind and present antigenic peptides to T-cells. Genes of
   the MHC are characterized by an outstanding genetic polymorphism, which
   is considered to be maintained by positive selection. Sites involved in
   peptide binding form binding pockets (P) that are collectively termed
   the peptide-binding region (PBR). In this study, we examined the level
   of MHC genetic diversity within and among natural populations of brown
   hare (Lepus europaeus) from Europe and Anatolia choosing for analysis of
   the second exon of the DQA locus, one of the most polymorphic class II
   loci. We aimed at an integrated population genetic analysis of L.
   europeaus by (i) correlating MHC polymorphism to genetic variability and
   phylogenetic status estimated previously from maternally (mtDNA) and
   biparentally (allozymes, microsatellites) inherited loci; and (ii)
   comparing full-length exon amino acid polymorphism with functional
   polymorphism in the PBR and the binding pockets P1, P6 and P9. A
   substantial level of DQA exon 2 polymorphism was detected with two
   completely different set of alleles between the Anatolian and European
   populations. However, the phylogeny of full-length exon 2 Leeu-DQA
   alleles did not show a strong phylogeographic signal. The presence of
   balancing selection was supported by a statistically significant excess
   of nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous in the PBR and a
   trans-species pattern of evolution detected after phylogenetic
   reconstruction. The differentiating patterns detected between genetic
   and functional polymorphism, i.e. the number and the distribution of
   pocket variants within and among populations, indicated a hierarchical
   action of selection pressures.}},

Abstract = {{We have used phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (COI and COII
   genes) and ecological niche modelling (ENM) to reconstruct the
   population history of Argosarchus horridus (White), a widespread species
   of New Zealand stick insect. These data were used to address outstanding
   questions on the role of glacial refugia in determining the distribution
   and genetic structure of New Zealand species. Phylogeographic analysis
   shows a general pattern of high diversity in upper North Island and
   reduced diversity in lower North Island and South Island. The ENM
   indicates that during the last glacial maximum, A. horridus was largely
   restricted to refugia around coastal areas of North Island. The ENM also
   suggests refugia on the northeast coast of South Island and southeast
   coast of North Island and this prediction is verified by phylogeographic
   analysis, which shows a clade restricted to this region. Argosarchus
   horridus is also most likely a geographic parthenogen where males are
   much rarer at higher latitudes. The higher levels of genetic variation
   in northern, bisexual populations suggest southern and largely unisexual
   populations originated from southwardly expanding parthenogenetic
   lineages. Bayesian skyline analysis also provides support for a recent
   population size increase consistent with a large increase in geographic
   distribution in the late Pleistocene. These results exemplify the
   utility of integrating ENM and phylogeographic analysis in testing
   hypotheses on the origin of geographic parthenogenesis and effects of
   Pleistocene environmental change on biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Historical (phylogenetic) biogeography and community ecology were once
   integrated as part of the broader study of organismal diversity, but in
   recent decades have become largely separate disciplines. This is
   unfortunate because many patterns studied by community ecologists may
   originate through processes studied by historical biogeographers and
   vice versa. In this study, we explore the causes of a geographic pattern
   of community structure (habitat use) in the emydid turtle assemblages of
   eastern North America, with more semi-terrestrial species of the
   subfamily Emydinae in the north and more aquatic species of
   Deirochelyinae in the south. Specifically, we address the factors that
   prevent northern emydines from invading southern communities. We test
   for competitive exclusion by examining patterns of range overlap, and
   test for the role of niche conservatism using analyses of climatic and
   physiological data based on a multilocus molecular phylogeny. We find no
   support for competitive exclusion, whereas several lines of evidence

Abstract = {{Integrative studies of genetics, neurobiology and behaviour indicate
   that polymorphism in specific genes contributes to variation observed in
   some complex social behaviours. The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin
   plays an important role in the regulation of a variety of social
   behaviours, including social attachment of males to females, through its
   action on the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). In socially monogamous
   prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), polymorphism in the length of
   microsatellite DNA within the regulatory region of the gene (avpr1a)
   encoding the V1aR predicts differences among males in neural expression
   of V1aRs and partner preference under laboratory conditions. However,
   understanding the extent to which V1aR mediates variation in prairie
   vole social and reproductive behaviour observed in nature requires
   investigating the consequences of avpr1a polymorphism and environmental
   influences under ecologically relevant conditions. We examined the
   relationship between avpr1a length polymorphism and monogamy among male
   prairie voles living in 0.1 ha enclosures during a time similar to their
   natural lifespan. We found no evidence that avpr1a genotype of males
   predicts variation in social monogamy measured in the field but some
   indices of social monogamy were affected by population density.
   Parentage data indicated that a male's avpr1a genotype significantly
   influenced the number of females with which he sired offspring and the
   total number of offspring sired. Total brain concentrations of V1aR mRNA
   were not associated with either male behaviour or avpr1a genotype. These
   data show that melding ecological field studies with neurogenetics can
   substantially augment our understanding of the effects of genes and
   environment on social behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Social behaviour of group-living animals is often influenced by the
   relatedness of individuals, thus understanding the genetic structure of
   groups is important for the interpretation of costs and benefits of
   social interactions. In this study, we investigated genetic relatedness
   in feeding aggregations of free-living house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus) during the nonbreeding season. This species is a frequent
   model system for studies of social behaviour (e.g. aggression, social
   foraging), but we lack adequate information on the kin structure of
   sparrow flocks. During two winters, we ringed and observed sparrows at
   feeding stations, and used resightings to identify stable flock-members
   and to calculate association indices between birds. We genotyped the
   birds using seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, and estimated
   pairwise relatedness coefficients and relatedness categories (close kin
   vs. unrelated) by maximum likelihood method. We found that most birds
   were unrelated to each other in the flocks (mean +/- SE relatedness
   coefficient: 0.06 +/- 0.002), although most individuals had at least a
   few close relatives in their home flock (14.3 +/- 0.6\% of flock-mates).
   Pairwise association between individuals was not significantly related
   to their genetic relatedness. Furthermore, there was no difference
   between within-flock vs. between-flock relatedness, and birds had
   similar proportions of close kin within and outside their home flock.
   Finally, relatedness among members of different flocks was unrelated to
   the distance between their flocks. Thus, sparrow flocks were not
   characterized by association of relatives, nevertheless the presence of
   some close kin may provide opportunity for kin-biased behaviours to
   evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Kin selection plays an important role in the evolution of social
   behaviour in terrestrial systems. The extent to which kin selection
   influences the evolution of social behaviour in marine systems is
   largely unexplored. Generally, it is considered that kin selection is
   irrelevant in marine systems, because it is assumed that the dispersing
   larval phase of marine organisms will break up kin associations. Here,
   we challenge this assumption and investigate the opportunity for kin
   selection in a coral reef fish: the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus.
   This fish lives in groups composed of a large male and a number of
   smaller females and nonbreeders. We use 10 polymorphic microsatellite
   loci to assess the relatedness of 265 individuals from 35 groups. The
   mean coefficient of relatedness among group members is 0.01 +/- 0.04,
   suggesting that individuals are not associated with close relatives.
   However, the distribution of pairwise relatedness of individuals within
   groups has an overabundance of positive values, and indicates that there
   might be 35 pairs of close relatives within groups. Further analyses
   reveal that close relatives likely are similar in size and small in
   size, suggesting that they might have recruited together. We conclude
   that it is possible for kin selection to operate in D. aruanus, but kin
   recognition will be a prerequisite for such selection. This study
   reveals that individuals can be associated with close relatives, and
   there is a hidden potential for kin selection, during certain parts of
   the life cycle of coral reef fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing evidence for parasite-mediated selection on the
   vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC), little is known about
   variation in the bacterial parasite community within and among host
   populations or its influence on MHC evolution. In this study, we
   characterize variation in the parasitic bacterial community associated
   with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry in five populations
   in British Columbia (BC), Canada across 2 years, and examine whether
   bacterial infections are a potential source of selection on the MHC. We
   found an unprecedented diversity of bacteria infecting fry with a total
   of 55 unique bacteria identified. Bacterial infection rates varied from
   9\% to 29\% among populations and there was a significant isolation by
   distance relationship in bacterial community phylogenetic similarity
   across the populations. Spatial variation in the frequency of infections
   and in the phylogenetic similarity of bacterial communities may result
   in differential parasite-mediated selection at the MHC across
   populations. Across all populations, we found evidence of a heterozygote
   advantage at the MHC class II, which may be a source of balancing
   selection on this locus. Interestingly, a co-inertia analysis indicated
   only susceptibility associations between a few of the MHC class I and II
   alleles and specific bacterial parasites; there was no evidence that any
   of the alleles provided resistance to the bacteria. Our results reveal a
   complex bacterial community infecting populations of a fish and
   underscore the importance of considering the role of multiple pathogens
   in the evolution of host adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{Prioritizing geographic areas for conservation attention is important -

   contain species with fewer close relatives elsewhere (Faith 1992). One
   might characterize the first as focusing on geographic, and the second
   on phylogenetic, rarity. To the extent that geographically rare species
   are at greater risk of extinction (Gaston \& Fuller 2009), and that
   phylogenetically rare species contribute disproportionally to overall
   biodiversity (Crozier 1997), it would seem reasonable to formally
   integrate the two approaches. In this issue, Rosauer et al. (2009) do
   just that; their elegant combined metric pinpoints areas missed out when

Abstract = {{Insect colonies have been traditionally regarded as closed societies
   comprised of completely sterile workers ruled over by a single
   once-mated queen. However, over the past 15 years, microsatellite
   studies of parentage have revealed that this perception is far from the
   truth (Beekman \& Oldroyd 2008). First, we learned that honey bee queens
   are far more promiscuous than we had previously imagined (Estoup et al.
   1994), with one Apis dorsata queen clocked at over 100 mates
   (Wattanachaiyingcharoen et al. 2003). Then Oldroyd et al. (1994)
   reported a honey bee colony from Queensland, where virtually all the
   males were sons of a single patriline of workers - a clear case of a
   cheater mutant that promoted intra-colonial reproductive parasitism.
   Then we learned that both bumble bee colonies (Lopez-Vaamonde et al.
   2004) and queenless honey bee colonies (Nanork et al. 2005, 2007) are
   routinely parasitized by workers from other nests that fly in and lay
   male-producing eggs that are then reared by the victim colony. There is
   even evidence that in a thelytokous honey bee population, workers lay
   female-destined eggs directly into queen cells, thus reincarnating
   themselves as a queen (Jordan et al. 2008). And let us not forget ants,
   where microsatellite studies have revealed equally bizarre and totally
   unexpected phenomena (e. g. Cahan \& Keller 2003; Pearcy et al. 2004;
   Fournier et al. 2005). Now, in this issue, Alves et al. (2009) use
   microsatellites to provide yet another shocking and completely
   unexpected revelation about the nefarious goings-on in insect colonies:
   intergenerational reproductive parasitism by stingless bee workers.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) is a widely used tool for
   quantifying the contribution of various levels of population structure
   to patterns of genetic variation. Implementations of AMOVA use
   permutation tests to evaluate null hypotheses of no population structure
   within groups and between groups. With few populations per group,
   between-group structure might be impossible to detect because only a few
   permutations of the sampled populations are possible. In fact, with
   fewer than six total populations, permutation tests will never result in
   P-values <0.05 for higher-level population structure. I present minimum
   numbers of replicates calculated from multinomial coefficients and an R
   script that can be used to evaluate the minimum P-value for any sampling
   scheme. While it might seem counterintuitive that a large sample of
   individuals is uninformative about hierarchical structure, the power to
   detect between-group differences depends on the number of populations
   per group and investigators should sample appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{For plant populations, gene movement through pollen and seed dispersal
   governs the size of local genetic neighbourhoods and shapes the
   opportunities for natural selection and genetic drift. A critical
   question is how together these two processes influence the evolutionary
   dynamics of local populations. To assess the respective contributions of
   pollen and seed flow, we propose a novel indirect assessment of the
   separate male and female gametic contributions to total effective
   parental size (N(e)), based on parental correlations estimated via
   kinship coefficients, that can be applied to data sets that include
   unambiguous genotypes for male and female gametic contributions. Using
   the endemic Californian valley oak (Quercus lobata) as our study
   species, we apply this method to a set of microsatellite genotypes for
   two distinct ecological sets of naturally recruiting seedlings with
   acorns attached. We found that the effective numbers of contributing
   male parents (N(ep)) exceed effective numbers of female parents (N(em))
   for seedlings established beneath adult trees (N(ep) = 8.1 and N(em) =
   1.1), as well as for seedlings established away from adult trees (N(ep)
   = 15.4 and N(em) = 2.7), illustrating that seed dispersal enhances
   pollen dispersal and increases the effective number of seed sources in
   open seedling patches. The resulting effective parental size of seedling
   populations translates into smaller effective numbers of parents for
   undispersed vs. dispersed seedlings (N(e) = 3.6 and N(e) = 6.7,
   respectively). This study introduces a novel statistic method and
   provides important new evidence that, on a short-term temporal scale,
   seed dispersal shapes the local neighbourhood size of new recruits.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing how genes flow across populations is a key component of
   conservation genetics. Gene flow in a natural population depends on
   ecological traits and the local environment, whereas for a livestock
   population, gene flow is driven by human activities. Spatial
   organization, relationships between farmers and their husbandry
   practices will define the farmer's network and so determine farmer
   connectivity. It is thus assumed that farmer connectivity will affect
   the genetic structure of their livestock. To test this hypothesis, goats
   reared by four different ethnic groups in a Vietnamese province were
   genotyped using 16 microsatellites. A Bayesian approach and spatial
   multivariate analysis (spatial principal component analysis, sPCA) were
   used to identify subpopulations and spatial organization. Ethnic group
   frequencies, husbandry practices and altitude were used to create cost
   maps that were implemented in a least-cost path approach. Genetic
   diversity in the Vietnamese goat population was low (0.508) compared to
   other local Asian breeds. Using a Bayesian approach, three clusters were
   identified. sPCA confirmed these three clusters and also that the
   genetic structure showed a significant spatial pattern. The least-cost
   path analysis showed that genetic differentiation was significantly
   correlated (0.131-0.207) to ethnic frequencies and husbandry practices.
   In brief, the spatial pattern observed in the goat population was the
   result of complex gene flow governed by the spatial distribution of
   ethnic groups, ethnicity and husbandry practices. In this study, we
   clearly linked the livestock genetic pattern to farmer connectivity and
   showed the importance of taking into account spatial information in
   genetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that parallel evolution should be common when the number
   of beneficial mutations is limited by selective constraints on protein
   structure. However, confirmation is scarce in natural populations. Here
   we studied the major haemoglobin genes of eight Andean duck lineages and
   compared them to 115 other waterfowl species, including the bar-headed
   goose (Anser indicus) and Abyssinian blue-winged goose (Cyanochen
   cyanopterus), two additional species living at high altitude. One to
   five amino acid replacements were significantly overrepresented or
   derived in each highland population, and parallel substitutions were
   more common than in simulated sequences evolved under a neutral model.
   Two substitutions evolved in parallel in the alpha A subunit of two
   (Ala-alpha 8) and five (Thr-alpha 77) taxa, and five identical beta A
   subunit substitutions were observed in two (Ser-beta 4, Glu-beta 94,
   Met-beta 133) or three (Ser-beta 13, Ser-beta 116) taxa. Substitutions
   at adjacent sites within the same functional protein region were also
   observed. Five such replacements were in exterior, solvent-accessible
   positions on the A helix and AB corner of the alpha A subunit. Five
   others were in close proximity to inositolpentaphosphate binding sites,
   and two pairs of independent replacements occurred at two different
   alpha(1)beta(1) intersubunit contacts. More than half of the
   substitutions in highland lineages resulted in the acquisition of serine
   or threonine (18 gains vs. 2 losses), both of which possess a hydroxyl
   group that can hydrogen bond to a variety of polar substrates. The
   patterns of parallel evolution observed in these waterfowl suggest that
   adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia has resulted from selection on
   unique but overlapping sets of one to five amino acid substitutions in
   each lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Formation of partially reproductively isolated ecotypes in the rough
   periwinkle, Littorina saxatilis, may be a case of incipient
   nonallopatric ecological speciation. To better understand the dynamics
   of ecotype formation, its timescale, driving forces and evolutionary
   consequences, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model
   incorporating relevant ecological, spatial and mate selection data for
   Swedish L. saxatilis. We explore the impact of bounded hybrid
   superiority, ecological scenarios and mate selection systems on ecotype
   formation, gene flow and the evolution of prezygotic isolation. Our
   model shows that ecotypes are expected to form rapidly in parapatry
   under conditions applicable to Swedish L. saxatilis and may proceed to
   speciation. However, evolution of nonrandom mating had complex
   behaviour. Ecotype evolution was inhibited by pre-existing mating
   preferences, but facilitated by the evolution of novel preferences.
   While in many scenarios positive assortative mating reduced gene flow
   between ecotypes, in others negative assortative mating arose,
   preferences were lost after ecotype formation, preferences were confined
   to one ecotype or the ancestral ecotype became extinct through sexual
   selection. Bounded hybrid superiority (as observed in nature) enhanced
   ecotype formation but increased gene flow. Our results highlight that
   ecotype formation and speciation are distinct processes: factors that
   contribute to ecotype formation can be detrimental to speciation and
   vice versa. The complex interactions observed between local adaptation
   and nonrandom mating imply that generalization from data is unreliable
   without quantitative theory for speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidization, or genome duplication, has played a critical role in
   the diversification of animals, fungi and plants. Little is known about
   the population structure and multiple origins of polyploid species
   because of the difficulty in identifying multiple homeologous nuclear
   genes. The allotetraploid species Arabidopsis kamchatica is closely
   related to the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and is distributed in
   a broader climatic niche than its parental species. Here, we performed
   direct sequencing of homeologous pairs of the low-copy nuclear genes WER
   and CHS by designing homeolog-specific primers, and obtained also
   chloroplast and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that 50 individuals covering the
   distribution range including North America are allopolyploids derived
   from Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri. Three major clusters
   within A. kamchatica were detected using Bayesian clustering. One
   cluster has widespread distribution. The other two are restricted to the
   southern part of the distribution range including Japan, where the
   parent A. lyrata is not currently distributed. This suggests that the
   mountains in Central Honshu and surrounding areas in Japan served as
   refugia during glacial-interglacial cycles and retained this diversity.
   We also found that multiple haplotypes of nuclear and chloroplast
   sequences of A. kamchatica are identical to those of their parental
   species. This indicates that multiple diploid individuals contributed to
   the origin of A. kamchatica. The haplotypes of low-copy nuclear genes in
   Japan suggest independent polyploidization events rather than
   introgression. Our findings suggest that self-compatibility and gene
   silencing occurred independently in different origins.}},

Abstract = {{Homoploid hybrid speciation has generally been viewed as a rare
   evolutionary phenomenon, with relatively few well-documented cases in
   nature. Here, we investigate the origin of Stephanomeria diegensis, a
   diploid flowering plant species that has been proposed to have arisen as
   a result of hybridization between S. exigua and S. virgata. Across the
   range of S. diegensis, all individuals share a common chloroplast
   haplotype with S. virgata while showing a greater affinity for S. exigua
   in terms of nuclear genetic diversity. A prinicipal coordinates analysis
   (PCO) based on the nuclear data revealed that S. diegensis is most
   similar to each parent along different axes. Moreover, a Bayesian
   clustering analysis as well as a hybrid index-based analysis showed
   evidence of mixed ancestry, with approximately two thirds of the S.
   diegensis nuclear genome derived from S. exigua. These results provide
   strong support for a homoploid hybrid origin of S. diegensis. Finally,
   contrary to the finding that homoploid hybrid species are typically
   multiply-derived, our results were most consistent with a single origin
   of this species.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new, broadly applicable measure of the spatial restriction
   of phylogenetic diversity, termed phylogenetic endemism (PE). PE
   combines the widely used phylogenetic diversity and weighted endemism
   measures to identify areas where substantial components of phylogenetic
   diversity are restricted. Such areas are likely to be of considerable
   importance for conservation. PE has a number of desirable properties not
   combined in previous approaches. It assesses endemism consistently,
   independent of taxonomic status or level, and independent of previously
   defined political or biological regions. The results can be directly
   compared between areas because they are based on equivalent spatial
   units. PE builds on previous phylogenetic analyses of endemism, but
   provides a more general solution for mapping endemism of lineages. We
   illustrate the broad applicability of PE using examples of Australian
   organisms having contrasting life histories: pea-flowered shrubs of the
   genus Daviesia (Fabaceae) and the Australian species of the
   Australo-Papuan tree frog radiation within the family Hylidae.}},

Abstract = {{Wing reduction and flightlessness are common features of alpine and
   subalpine insects, and are typically interpreted as evolutionary
   adaptations to increase fecundity and promote local recruitment. Here,
   we assess the impact of wing reduction on dispersal in stoneflies
   (Plecoptera: Gripopterygidae: Zelandoperla) in southern New Zealand.
   Specifically, we present comparative phylogeographic analyses (COI; H3)
   of strong-flying Zelandoperla decorata (144 individuals, 63 localities)
   vs. the co-distributed but weak-flying Zelandoperla fenestrata species
   group (186 individuals, 81 localities). The latter group exhibits a
   variety of morphotypes, ranging from fully winged to completely
   wingless. Consistent with its capacity for strong flight-mediated
   dispersal, Z. decorata exhibited no substantial phylogeographic
   differentiation across its broad South Island range. Conversely the
   weak-flying fenestrata species group exhibited substantial genetic
   structure across both fine and broad geographic scales. Intriguingly,
   the variable degrees of wing development observed within the fenestrata
   species group had no apparent impact on levels of phylogeographic
   structure, which were high regardless of morphotype, suggesting that
   even fully winged specimens of this group do not fly. This finding
   implies that Zelandoperla flight loss occurs independently of wing loss,
   and might reflect underlying flight muscle reduction.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{One of the original goals of phylogeography was to use genetic data to
   identify historical events that might contribute to breaks among
   communities. In this study, we examine the phylogeography of a common
   livebearing fish (Poecilia gillii) from Costa Rica. Our goal was to
   determine if phylogeographical breaks in this species were congruent
   with previously defined boundaries among four fish community provinces.
   We hypothesized that if abiotic factors influence both community
   boundaries and genetic structuring in P. gillii then we might find four
   clades within our focal species that were geographically separated along
   community boundary lines. Similarly, we expected to find most of the
   genetic variation in P. gillii partitioned among these four geographical
   regions. We generated DNA sequence data (mitochondrial cytochrome b and
   nuclear S7 small ribosomal subunit) for 260 individuals from 42
   populations distributed across Costa Rica. We analysed these data using
   phylogenetic (parsimony and likelihood) and coalescent approaches to
   estimate phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes, patterns of gene
   flow and effective population size. Contrary to our expectations, we did
   not find four monophyletic groups that mapped cleanly to our
   geographical community provinces. However, one of our clades was
   restricted to a single province, suggesting that common earth history
   events could be responsible for both genetic structuring in P. gillii
   and fish community composition in this area. However, our results show a
   complex pattern of gene flow throughout other regions in Costa Rica
   where genetic structuring is not predicted by community province
   boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Insect societies are well known for their high degree of cooperation,
   but their colonies can potentially be exploited by reproductive workers
   who lay unfertilized, male eggs, rather than work for the good of the
   colony. Recently, it has also been discovered that workers in bumblebees
   and Asian honeybees can succeed in entering and parasitizing unrelated
   colonies to produce their own male offspring. The aim of this study was
   to investigate whether such intraspecific worker parasitism might also
   occur in stingless bees, another group of highly social bees. Based on a
   large-scale genetic study of the species Melipona scutellaris, and the
   genotyping of nearly 600 males from 45 colonies, we show that similar to
   20\% of all males are workers' sons, but that around 80\% of these had
   genotypes that were incompatible with them being the sons of workers of
   the resident queen. By tracking colonies over multiple generations, we
   show that these males were not produced by drifted workers, but rather
   by workers that were the offspring of a previous, superseded queen. This
   means that uniquely, workers reproductively parasitize the
   next-generation workforce. Our results are surprising given that most
   colonies were sampled many months after the previous queen had died and
   that workers normally only have a life expectancy of similar to 30 days.
   It also implies that reproductive workers greatly outlive all other
   workers. We explain our results in the context of kin selection theory,
   and the fact that it pays workers more from exploiting the colony if
   costs are carried by less related individuals.}},

Abstract = {{For organisms with great fecundity and high mortality in early life
   stages, such as shellfish or fishes, the need to match reproductive
   activity with environmental conditions conducive to spawning,
   fertilization, larval development and recruitment may result in extreme
   variance in reproductive success among individuals. The main objective
   of this study was to investigate evidence of large variance in the
   reproductive success of the striped bass Morone saxatilis in the
   Santee-Cooper system, South Carolina, USA. Seven microsatellite loci
   were analysed in 603 recruits representing three yearly cohorts from
   1992 to 1994, and a group analysis was performed to identify full-sib
   families. Large variance in reproductive success was detected, with a
   few large, full-sib families contributing disproportionately to each of
   the cohorts. The severity of sweepstakes reproductive success varied
   among cohorts depending on environmentally imposed mortality.
   Estimations of the effective number of breeders in these long-lived fish
   ranged from 24 in 1992 to 44 in 1994. Furthermore, the estimated genetic
   effective population size (N(e) = 93) is approximately four orders of
   magnitude lower than estimates of adult census size (N = 362 000).
   Furthermore, the presence of large full-sib families indicates that
   striped bass engage in pair mating in the wild. Heterogeneity in genetic
   composition was also observed among cohorts, suggesting that genetically
   different adults contribute to different cohorts and that chance rather
   than fitness variation determines reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Land use changes including deforestation, road construction and
   agricultural encroachments have been linked to the increased prevalence
   of several infectious diseases. In order to better understand how
   deforestation affects the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases
   in wildlife, nine paired sites were sampled (disturbed vs. undisturbed
   habitats) in Southern Cameroon. We studied the diversity, prevalence and
   distribution of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other
   related haemosporidians (species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from
   these sites in two widespread species of African rainforest birds, the
   yellow-whiskered greenbul (Andropadus latirostris, Pycnonotidae) and the
   olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea, Nectariniidae). Twenty-six
   mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages were identified: 20 Plasmodium
   lineages and 6 Haemoproteus lineages. These lineages showed no
   geographic specificity, nor significant differences in lineage diversity
   between habitat types. However, we found that the prevalence of
   Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus infections were significantly higher in
   undisturbed than in deforested habitats (Leucocytozoon spp. 50.3\% vs.
   35.8\%, Haemoproteus spp. 16.3\% vs. 10.8\%). We also found higher
   prevalence for all haemosporidian parasites in C. olivacea than in A.
   latirostris species (70.2\% vs. 58.2\%). Interestingly, we found one
   morphospecies of Plasmodium in C. olivacea, as represented by a clade of
   related lineages, showed increased prevalence at disturbed sites, while
   another showed a decrease, testifying to different patterns of
   transmission, even among closely related lineages of avian malaria, in
   relation to deforestation. Our work demonstrates that anthropogenic
   habitat change can affect host-parasite systems and result in opposing
   trends in prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in wild bird
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation infrastructures such as roads, railroads and canals can
   have major environmental impacts. Ecological road effects include the
   destruction and fragmentation of habitat, the interruption of ecological
   processes and increased erosion and pollution. Growing concern about
   these ecological road effects has led to the emergence of a new
   scientific discipline called road ecology. The goal of road ecology is
   to provide planners with scientific advice on how to avoid, minimize or
   mitigate negative environmental impacts of transportation. In this
   review, we explore the potential of molecular genetics to contribute to
   road ecology. First, we summarize general findings from road ecology and
   review studies that investigate road effects using genetic data. These
   studies generally focus only on barrier effects of roads on local
   genetic diversity and structure and only use a fraction of available
   molecular approaches. Thus, we propose additional molecular applications
   that can be used to evaluate road effects across multiple scales and
   dimensions of the biodiversity hierarchy. Finally, we make
   recommendations for future research questions and study designs that
   would advance molecular road ecology. Our review demonstrates that
   molecular approaches can substantially contribute to road ecology
   research and that interdisciplinary, long-term collaborations will be
   particularly important for realizing the full potential of molecular
   road ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Most plant pathogens present complex life cycles, in which the clonal
   reproduction may impede the delimitation of population entities. By
   studying the genetic structure of the wheat yellow rust caused by
   Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST), we highlighted difficulties
   impeding population delimitation in highly clonal species. Despite the
   high dispersal potential of PST, southern France isolates were shown to
   be divergent from a northwestern European population. A 2-year survey
   was performed in the Mediterranean region to assess the geographic
   distribution of southern isolates: 453 isolates collected in 11
   countries were genotyped using 15 simple sequence repeat markers. A
   subsample was analysed for virulence against 23 resistance genes. The
   dominant strain in the western Mediterranean region was further studied
   with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for a
   geographic substructure. Both `individual'- and `population' centred
   analyses of polymorphism markers revealed two south-specific groups: a
   predominant group, with a broad variability and a wide distribution in
   both western and eastern Mediterranean countries, and a minor group in
   the western Mediterranean. The east-west gradient of genetic diversity
   suggested gene flow from the Middle East with subsequent founder effects
   and genetic divergence, and demonstrated the local survival of a western
   Mediterranean population. The high frequency of the resistance gene Yr8
   observed in cultivars from Tunisia and Algeria may contribute to
   maintain the north/south structure observed in France. In addition to
   migration and local adaptation, the dynamics of clonal lineage
   diversification and replacement should be considered to define
   population entities in strongly clonal species.}},

Abstract = {{While habitat fragmentation is a central issue in forest conservation
   studies in the face of broad-scale anthropogenic changes to the
   environment, its effects on contemporary mating patterns remain
   controversial. This is partly because of the inherent variation in
   mating patterns which may exist within species and the fact that few
   studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of
   forest fragmentation on contemporary mating patterns, including
   effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the
   Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite
   markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired
   fragmented and continuous populations on the island of Tasmania and in
   Victoria on mainland Australia. The mating patterns in the two
   continuous populations were similar, despite large differences in
   population density. In contrast, the two fragmented populations were
   variable and idiosyncratic in their mating patterns, particularly in
   their pollen dispersal kernels. The continuous populations showed
   relatively high outcrossing rates (86-89\%) and low correlated paternity
   (0.03-0.06) compared with the fragmented populations (65-79\% and
   0.12-0.20 respectively). A greater proportion of trees contributed to
   reproduction in the fragmented (de/d >= 0.5) compared with the
   continuous populations (de/d = 0.03-0.04). Despite significant
   inbreeding in the offspring of the fragmented populations, there was
   little evidence of loss of genetic diversity. It is argued that enhanced
   medium-and long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes may act to
   partly buffer the remnant populations from the negative effects of
   inbreeding and drift.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms that determine population structure in highly mobile
   marine species are poorly understood, but useful towards understanding
   the evolution of diversity, and essential for effective conservation and
   management. In this study, we compare putative sperm whale populations
   located in the Gulf of Mexico, western North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea
   and North Sea using mtDNA control region sequence data and 16
   polymorphic microsatellite loci. The Gulf of Mexico, western North
   Atlantic and North Sea populations each possessed similar low levels of
   haplotype and nucleotide diversity at the mtDNA locus, while the
   Mediterranean Sea population showed no detectable mtDNA diversity.
   Mitochondrial DNA results showed significant differentiation between all
   populations, while microsatellites showed significant differentiation
   only for comparisons with the Mediterranean Sea, and at a much lower
   level than seen for mtDNA. Samples from either side of the North
   Atlantic in coastal waters showed no differentiation for mtDNA, while
   North Atlantic samples from just outside the Gulf of Mexico (the western
   North Atlantic sample) were highly differentiated from samples within
   the Gulf at this locus. Our analyses indicate a previously unknown
   fidelity of females to coastal basins either side of the North Atlantic,
   and suggest the movement of males among these populations for breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Central predictions of climate warming models include increased climate
   variability and increased severity of heat waves. Physiological
   acclimatization in populations across large-scale ecological gradients
   in habitat temperature fluctuation is an important factor to consider in
   detecting responses to climate change related increases in thermal
   fluctuation. We measured in vivo cardiac thermal maxima and used
   microarrays to profile transcriptome heat and cold stress responses in
   cardiac tissue of intertidal zone porcelain crabs across biogeographic
   and seasonal gradients in habitat temperature fluctuation. We observed
   acclimatization dependent induction of heat shock proteins, as well as
   unknown genes with heat shock protein-like expression profiles. Thermal
   acclimatization had the largest effect on heat stress responses of
   extensin-like, beta tubulin, and unknown genes. For these genes, crabs
   acclimatized to thermally variable sites had higher constitutive
   expression than specimens from low variability sites, but heat stress
   dramatically induced expression in specimens from low variability sites
   and repressed expression in specimens from highly variable sites. Our
   application of ecological transcriptomics has yielded new biomarkers
   that may represent sensitive indicators of acclimatization to habitat
   temperature fluctuation. Our study also has identified novel genes whose
   further description may yield novel understanding of cellular responses
   to thermal acclimatization or thermal stress.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic organisms living in a range of photic environments require
   specific mechanisms to tune their visual pigments. Maximum absorbance
   (lambda(max)) of retinal rods in populations of the marine demersal sand
   goby, (Pomatoschistus minutus; Gobiidae, Teleostei) correlates with the
   local optic environment. It has been shown that this is not regulated
   through a physiological response by exchanging the rhodopsin
   chromophore. To test for evolutionary adaptation, the sequence of the
   rhodopsin (RH1) gene was analysed in 165 Pomatoschistus minutus
   individuals from seven populations across its distribution range.
   Analysis showed a high level of intraspecific polymorphism at the RH1
   gene, including nonsynonymous mutations on amino acids, known as
   spectral tuning sites. Population differentiation at these sites was in
   agreement with the observed differentiation in lambda(max) values.
   Analyses of d(N)/d(S) substitution rate ratios and likelihood ratio
   tests under site-specific models detected a significant signal of
   positive Darwinian selection on the RH1 gene. A strong discrepancy in
   differentiation was noticed between RH1 gene variation and the
   presumably neutral microsatellites and mitochondrial data. Samples did
   not cluster according to geographical or historical proximity with
   regards to RH1, but according to the general photic conditions of the
   habitat environment of the sand goby. This study highlights the
   usefulness of sensory genes, like rhodopsin, for studying the
   characteristics of local adaptation in marine nonmodel organisms.}},

Abstract = {{We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from specimens
   collected throughout Lake Tanganyika to clarify the evolutionary
   relationship between Lamprologus callipterus and Neolamprologus
   fasciatus. The nuclear data support the reciprocal monophyly of these
   two shell-breeding lamprologine cichlids. However, mtDNA sequences show
   that (i) L. callipterus includes two divergent and geographically
   disjunct (North-South) mtDNA lineages; and that (ii) N. fasciatus
   individuals cluster in a lineage sister group to the northern lineage of
   L. callipterus. The two mtDNA lineages of L. callipterus diverged c. 684
   kya to 1.2 Ma, coinciding with a major water level low stand in Lake
   Tanganyika, which divided the lake into isolated sub-lakes. This
   suggests that the two mtDNA lineages originated as the result of the
   separation of L. callipterus populations in different sub-basins. The
   incongruent phylogenetic position of N. fasciatus can best be explained
   by an ancient unidirectional introgression from L. callipterus into N.
   fasciatus. Remarkably, our data indicate that this event resulted in the
   complete mtDNA replacement in N. fasciatus. Our data suggest that
   hybridization occurred soon after the divergence of the two L.
   callipterus mtDNA lineages, probably still during the water level low
   stand, and that subsequently the invading mtDNA lineage spread
   throughout the lake.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of many species inhabiting northwestern North America
   has been heavily influenced by the climatic changes during the late
   Pleistocene. Several studies have suggested that species were restricted
   to glacial refugia north and/or south of the continental ice sheet
   front. It is also hypothesized that the coast of northwestern North
   America could have been a prime location for glacial refugia because of
   the lowering of the eustatic sea level and the concomitant rise of the
   continental shelf because of tectonic rebound. Alternatively, some
   coastal species distributions and demographics may have been unaffected
   in the long-term by the last glacial maximum (LGM). We tested the
   glacial refugium hypothesis on an obligate coastal plant species, Carex
   macrocephala by sampling 600 individuals from 41 populations with 11
   nuclear microsatellite loci and the rpL16 plastid intragenic spacer
   region. The microsatellite data sets suggest a low level of population
   differentiation with a standardized G(ST)' = 0.032 and inbreeding was
   high with an F = 0.969. The homogenization of the populations along the
   coast was supported by a principal coordinate analysis, AMOVAs and
   SAMOVA analyses. Analyses using the rpL16 data set support the results
   of the microsatellite analyses, with a low F(ST) of 0.042. Coalescent
   and mismatch analyses using rpL16 suggest that C. macrocephala has not
   gone through a significant bottleneck within the past 100 000 years,
   although a much earlier population expansion was indicated by the
   mismatch analysis. Carex macrocephala exhibits the characteristics of
   metapopulation dynamics and on the basis of these results, we concluded
   that it was not restricted to glacial refugia during the LGM, but that
   it existed as a large metapopulation.}},

Abstract = {{Data analysis in phylogeographic investigations is typically conducted
   in either a qualitative manner, or alternatively via the testing of null
   hypotheses. The former, where inferences about population processes are
   derived from geographical patterns of genetic variation, may be subject
   to confirmation bias and prone to overinterpretation. Testing the
   predictions of null hypotheses is arguably less prone to bias than
   qualitative approaches, but only if the tested hypotheses are
   biologically meaningful. As it is difficult to know a priori if this is
   the case, there is the general need for additional methodological
   approaches in phylogeographic research. Here, we explore an alternative
   method for analysing phylogeographic data that utilizes information
   theory to quantify the probability of multiple hypotheses given the
   data. We accomplish this by augmenting the model-selection procedure
   implemented in IMA with calculations of Akaike Information Criterion
   scores and model probabilities. We generate a ranking of 17 models each
   representing a set of historical evolutionary processes that may have
   contributed to the evolution of Plethodon idahoensis, and then quantify
   the relative strength of support for each hypothesis given the data
   using metrics borrowed from information theory. Our results suggest that
   two models have high probability given the data. Each of these models
   includes population divergence and estimates of ancestral h that differ
   from estimates of descendent theta, inferences consistent with prior
   work in this system. However, the models disagree in that one includes
   migration as a parameter and one does not, suggesting that there are two
   regions of parameter space that produce model likelihoods that are
   similar in magnitude given our data. Results of a simulation study
   suggest that when data are simulated with migration, most of the optimal
   models include migration as a parameter, and further that when all of
   the shared polymorphism results from incomplete lineage sorting, most of
   the optimal models do not. The results could also indicate a lack of
   precision, which may be a product of the amount of data that we have
   collected. In any case, the information-theoretic metrics that we have
   applied to the analysis of our data are statistically rigorous, as are
   hypothesis-testing approaches, but move beyond the `reject/fail to
   reject' dichotomy of conventional hypothesis testing in a manner that
   provides considerably more flexibility to researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Limited dispersal and connectivity in marine organisms can have negative
   fitness effects in populations that are small and isolated, but reduced
   genetic exchange may also promote the potential for local adaptation.
   Here, we compare the levels of genetic diversity and connectivity in the
   coral Montastraea cavernosa among both central and peripheral
   populations throughout its range in the Atlantic. Genetic data from one
   mitochondrial and two nuclear loci in 191 individuals show that M.
   cavernosa is subdivided into three genetically distinct regions in the
   Atlantic: Caribbean-North Atlantic, Western South Atlantic (Brazil) and
   Eastern Tropical Atlantic (West Africa). Within each region, populations
   have similar allele frequencies and levels of genetic diversity; indeed,
   no significant differentiation was found between populations separated
   by as much as 3000 km, suggesting that this coral species has the
   ability to disperse over large distances. Gene flow within regions does
   not, however, translate into connectivity across the entire Atlantic.
   Instead, substantial differences in allele frequencies across regions
   suggest that genetic exchange is infrequent between the Caribbean,
   Brazil and West Africa. Furthermore, markedly lower levels of genetic
   diversity are observed in the Brazilian and West African populations.
   Genetic diversity and connectivity may contribute to the resilience of a
   coral population to disturbance. Isolated peripheral populations may be
   more vulnerable to human impacts, disease or climate change relative to
   those in the genetically diverse Caribbean-North Atlantic region.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4298-4315}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mitochondrial markers are still often used alone to identify
   evolutionary units, despite widespread evidence for processes such as
   incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization that may blur
   past population history. The combination of mitochondrial DNA data with
   other sources of information (morphology, nuclear genes) is a powerful
   tool to reveal when and why mitochondrial markers are potentially
   misleading. In this study, we evaluate the performance of mtDNA markers
   to unravel the evolutionary history of Spanish lizards from the Podarcis
   hispanicus species complex. We first uncover several cases of
   discordance between morphological and mitochondrial data in delimitation
   of taxa. To assess the origin of these discordances, we analysed the
   same populations using several independent nuclear loci. Both
   morphological and nuclear markers identified the same three evolutionary
   units in the region, while mitochondrial data revealed four deeply
   divergent lineages. We suggest here that the most likely scenario to
   explain this discordance is ancient mitochondrial introgression
   originating from a fourth evolutionary unit presently absent from the
   study area. Notably, this resulted in a complete replacement of the
   original lineage in a large part of the distribution of one of the taxa
   investigated. We discuss the potential evolutionary scenarios leading to
   this complete mitochondrial replacement and suggest why the previous
   studies have failed to recover the correct history of this species
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae is commonly found in
   agricultural fields. The cosmopolitan species is found in Africa,
   Europe, America, Asia and Australia. Three hypotheses may explain this
   worldwide distribution: First, speciation occurred before the continents
   separated 120 Ma; second, the distribution is a result of human-mediated
   dispersal related to agriculture and finally, the morphologically
   defined species may encompass several local endemic species. To test
   these hypotheses, three genes were sequenced from 82 isolates of G.
   mosseae originating from six continents and the resulting sequences
   analysed for geographical subdivision and estimation of migration
   between continents. Coalescent analyses estimated divergence and age of
   mutations. Bayesian coalescent modelling was used to reveal important
   past population changes in the global population. The sequence data
   showed no geographical structure, with identical genotypes found on
   different continents. Coalescence analyses indicated a recent
   diversification in the species, and the data could be explained by a
   recent population expansion in G. mosseae. The results of this study
   suggest that speciation and the range expansion happened much later than
   continental spread and that human activity may have had a major impact
   on the dispersal and the population structure of the fungus.}},

Abstract = {{By definition, parasitic organisms are strongly dependant on their
   hosts, and for a great majority, this dependence includes host-to-host
   transmission. Constraints imposed by the host's spatial distribution and
   demography, in combination with those of the parasite, can lead to a
   metapopulation structure, where parasite populations are highly
   stochastic (i.e. prone to frequent extinctions and re-colonizations) and
   where drift becomes a major force shaping standing genetic variation.
   This, in turn, will directly affect the observed population structure,
   along with the ability of the parasite to adapt (or co-adapt) to its
   host. However, only a specific consideration of temporal dynamics can
   reveal the extent to which drift shapes parasite population structure;
   this is rarely taken into account in population genetic studies of
   parasitic organisms. The study by Bruyndonckx et al. in this issue of
   Molecular Ecology does just this and, in doing so, illustrates how a
   comparison of host-parasite co-structures in light of temporal dynamics
   can be particularly informative for understanding the ecological and
   evolutionary constraints imposed by the host. More specifically, the
   authors examine spatial and temporal population genetic data of a
   parasitic mite Spinturnix bechsteini that exclusively exploits the
   Bechstein's bat Myotis bechsteinii and consider these data in relation
   to host-parasite life histories and the population structure of the
   host.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand has long been a conundrum to biogeographers, possessing as
   it does geophysical and biotic features characteristic of both an island
   and a continent. This schism is reflected in provocative debate among
   dispersalist, vicariance biogeographic and panbiogeographic schools. A
   strong history in biogeography has spawned many hypotheses, which have
   begun to be addressed by a flood of molecular analyses. The time is now
   ripe to synthesize these findings on a background of geological and
   ecological knowledge. It has become increasingly apparent that most of
   the biota of New Zealand has links with other southern lands
   (particularly Australia) that are much more recent than the breakup of
   Gondwana. A compilation of molecular phylogenetic analyses of ca 100
   plant and animal groups reveals that only 10\% of these are even
   plausibly of archaic origin dating to the vicariant splitting of
   Zealandia from Gondwana. Effects of lineage extinction and lack of good
   calibrations in many cases strongly suggest that the actual proportion
   is even lower, in keeping with extensive Oligocene inundation of
   Zealandia. A wide compilation of papers covering phylogeographic
   structuring of terrestrial, freshwater and marine species shows some
   patterns emerging. These include: east-west splits across the Southern
   Alps, east-west splits across North Island, north-south splits across
   South Island, star phylogenies of southern mountain isolates, spread
   from northern, central and southern areas of high endemism, and recent
   recolonization (postvolcanic and anthropogenic). Excepting the last of
   these, most of these patterns seem to date to late Pliocene, coinciding
   with the rapid uplift of the Southern Alps. The diversity of New Zealand
   geological processes (sinking, uplift, tilting, sea level change,
   erosion, volcanism, glaciation) has produced numerous patterns, making
   generalizations difficult. Many species maintain pre-Pleistocene
   lineages, with phylogeographic structuring more similar to the
   Mediterranean region than northern Europe. This structure reflects the
   fact that glaciation was far from ubiquitous, despite the topography.
   Intriguingly, then, origins of the flora and fauna are island-like,
   whereas phylogeographic structure often reflects continental geological
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is
   important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and
   ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot
   disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite's population structure
   will depend upon the host's spatial distribution. Geographical barriers
   affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite
   populations. However, how the host's social system affects the genetic
   structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population
   structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix
   bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein's
   bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between
   mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites
   can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of
   restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic
   differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In
   contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we
   investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies.
   This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and
   bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of
   isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and/or from
   mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may
   meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data
   show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is
   influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its
   bat host.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3593-3602}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Increasing habitat fragmentation poses an immediate threat to population
   viability, as gene flow patterns are changed in these altered
   landscapes. Patterns of genetic divergence can potentially reveal the
   impact of these shifts in landscape connectivity. However, divergence
   patterns not only carry the signature of altered contemporary
   landscapes, but also historical ones. When considered separately, both
   recent and historical landscape structure appear to significantly affect
   connectivity among 51 wood frog (Rana sylvatica) populations. However,
   by controlling for correlations among landscape structure from multiple
   time periods, we show that patterns of genetic divergence reflect recent
   landscape structure as opposed to landscape structure prior to European
   settlement of the region (before 1850s). At the same time,
   within-population genetic diversities remain high and a genetic
   signature of population bottlenecks is lacking. Together, these results
   suggest that metapopulation processes - not drift-induced divergence
   associated with strong demographic bottlenecks following habitat loss -
   underlie the strikingly rapid consequences of temporally shifting
   landscape structure on these amphibians. We discuss the implications of
   these results in the context of understanding the role of population
   demography in the adaptive variation observed in wood frog populations.}},

Abstract = {{The success of non-native species may depend on the genetic resources
   maintained through the invasion process. The Coqui (Eleutherodactylus
   coqui), a frog endemic to Puerto Rico, was introduced to Hawaii in the
   late 1980s via the horticulture trade, and has become an aggressive
   invader. To explore whether genetic diversity and population structure
   changed with the introduction, we assessed individuals from 15
   populations across the Hawaiian Islands and 13 populations across Puerto
   Rico using six to nine polymorphic microsatellite loci and five
   dorsolateral colour patterns. Allelic richness (R(T)) and gene diversity
   were significantly higher in Puerto Rico than in Hawaii populations.
   Hawaii also had fewer colour patterns (two versus three to five per
   population) than Puerto Rico. We found no isolation by distance in the
   introduced range, even though it exists in the native range. Results
   suggest extensive mixing among frog populations across Hawaii, and that
   their spread has been facilitated by humans. Like previous research, our
   results suggest that Hawaiian Coquis were founded by individuals from
   sites around San Juan, but unlike previous research the colour pattern
   and molecular genetic data (nuclear and mtDNA) support two separate
   introductions, one on the island of Hawaii and one on Maui. Coquis are
   successful invaders in Hawaii despite the loss of genetic variation.
   Future introductions may increase genetic variation and potentially its
   range.}},

Abstract = {{Although new empirical evidence shows that sympatric speciation has
   occurred in some species, there are few indisputable model organisms for
   this process of speciation. The two subspecies (Gymnocypris eckloni
   eckloni and G. e. scoliostomus) of the schizothoracine Gymnocypris fish
   species complex from a small glacier lake in the Tibetan Plateau, Lake
   Sunmcuo, fit several of the key characteristics of the sympatric
   speciation model. We used combined mitochondrial control region
   sequences and the cytochrome b gene (1894 bp) to address the
   phylogenetics and population genetics of 232 specimens of G. e. eckloni
   and G. e. scoliostomus, as well as all of its closely related sister
   species. We found that: (i) a total of four old lineages were uncovered
   in the widespread G. e. eckloni, of which only one was shown to be
   shared with all G. e. scoliostomus individuals and (ii) the new
   subspecies (G. e. scoliostomus) evolved in Lake Sunmcuo from the
   ancestral G. e. eckloni population within approximately 0.057 Ma. These
   two taxa of the species complex are morphologically distinct, and
   reproductive isolation is further suggested. Ecological disruptive
   selection based on morphological traits (e.g. mouth cleft characters)
   and food utilization may be a mechanism of incipient speciation of two
   sympatric populations within Lake Sunmcuo. This study provides the first
   genetic evidence for sympatric speciation in the schizothoracine fish.}},

Abstract = {{The two species of the palm genus Howea (Arecaceae) from Lord Howe
   Island, a minute volcanic island in the Tasman Sea, are now regarded as
   one of the most compelling examples of sympatric speciation, although
   this view is still disputed by some authors. Population genetic and
   ecological data are necessary to provide a more coherent and
   comprehensive understanding of this emerging model system. Here, we
   analyse data on abundance, juvenile recruitment, pollination mode and
   genetic variation and structure in both species. We find that Howea
   forsteriana is less abundant than Howea belmoreana. The genetic data
   based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms markers indicate
   similar levels of variation in the two species, despite the estimated
   census population size of H. belmoreana being three times larger than
   that of H. forsteriana. Genetic structure within species is low although
   some weak isolation by distance is detectable. Gene flow between species
   appears to be extremely limited and restricted to early-generation
   hybrids - only three admixed individuals, classified as F2s or first
   generation backcrosses to a parental species, were found among sampled
   palms. We conclude that speciation in Howea was indeed sympatric,
   although under certain strict definitions it may be called parapatric.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of tropical insects are increasingly uncovering cryptic species
   - morphologically similar yet reproductively isolated taxa once thought
   to comprise a single interbreeding entity. The vast majority of such
   species are described from a single location. This leaves us with little
   information on geographic range and intraspecific variation and limits
   our ability to infer the forces responsible for generating such
   diversity. For example, in herbivorous and parasitic insects, multiple
   specialists are often discovered within what were thought to be single
   more generalized species. Host shifts are likely to have contributed to
   speciation in these cases. But when and where did those shifts occur,
   and were they facilitated by geographic isolation? We attempted to
   answer these questions for two cryptic species within the butterfly
   Cymothoe egesta that were recently discovered on different host plants
   in central Cameroon. We first used mtDNA markers to separate individuals
   collected on the two hosts within Cameroon and then extended our
   analysis to incorporate individuals collected across the entire
   pan-Afrotropical range of the original taxon. To our surprise, we found
   that the species are almost entirely allopatric, dividing the original
   range and overlapping only in the narrow zone of West-Central Africa
   where they were first discovered in sympatry. This finding, combined
   with analyses of genetic variation within each butterfly species,
   strongly suggests that speciation occurred in allopatry, probably during
   the Pleistocene. We discuss the implications of our results for
   understanding speciation among other cryptic species recently discovered
   in the tropics and argue that more work is needed on geographic patterns
   and host usage in such taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The role of Southern European peninsulas as glacial refugia for
   temperate species has been widely established, but phylogeographic
   patterns within refugia are being only recently addressed. Here we
   describe the phylogeographic patterns for Southern water vole (Arvicola
   sapidus) in its whole distribution across Iberia and France. Control
   region and cytochrome b sequences were obtained for 228 samples from 130
   localities across Iberia and France. Eighty-five haplotypes were found
   in total yielding a high overall mitochondrial diversity (pi = 0.027; H
   = 0.974). Phylogeographic structure was relatively shallow (3.1\%
   average intraspecific divergence) with few supported clades and 95\% and
   90\% maximum parsimony unconnected networks, but significant, as
   reflected in increased pairwise nucleotide divergences with distance (r
   = 0.197, P = 0.03) and significant autocorrelation up to similar to 500
   km. Spatial analysis of molecular variance analysis detected seven
   geographical groups explaining 43.73\% of the total mitochondrial
   variation. We detected demographic expansions in three of these groups.
   A recent colonization of France from Iberia was suggested and estimated
   around 62 000 years bp by an isolation-with-migration model. Our results
   suggest the contribution of episodes of isolation in glacial subrefugia
   in Iberia, but seem to exclude a long-term isolation over successive
   glacial cycles. Phylogeographic divergence was probably tempered by
   relatively large population sizes and rapid and extensive mixing among
   subrefugia during interglacials, that might have eroded the
   phylogeographic structure accumulated at glacial peaks. Phenotypic
   differences in A. sapidus do not delineate historically isolated
   intraspecific divisions and do not warrant subspecific delimitations.
   Our results do support the existence of subrefugia within Iberia and
   their role in promoting intraspecific divergences.}},

Abstract = {{We report the phylogeographic pattern of the Patagonian and Subantarctic
   plant Hypochaeris incana endemic to southeastern South America. We
   applied amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and chloroplast
   DNA (cpDNA) analysis to 28 and 32 populations, respectively, throughout
   its distributional range and assessed ploidy levels using flow
   cytometry. While cpDNA data suggest repeated or simultaneous parallel
   colonization of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego by several haplotypes
   and/or hybridization, AFLPs reveal three clusters corresponding to
   geographic regions. The central and northern Patagonian clusters
   (similar to 38-51 degrees S), which are closer to the outgroup, contain
   mainly tetraploid, isolated and highly differentiated populations with
   low genetic diversity. To the contrary, the southern Patagonian and
   Fuegian cluster (similar to 51-55 degrees S) contains mainly diploid
   populations with high genetic diversity and connected by high levels of
   gene flow. The data suggest that H. incana originated at the diploid
   level in central or northern Patagonia, from where it migrated south.
   All three areas, northern, central and southern, have similar levels of
   rare and private AFLP bands, suggesting that all three served as refugia
   for H. incana during glacial times. In southern Patagonia and Tierra del
   Fuego, the species seems to have expanded its populational system in
   postglacial times, when the climate became warmer and more humid. In
   central and northern Patagonia, the populations seem to have become
   restricted to favourable sites with increasing temperature and
   decreasing moisture and there was a parallel replacement of diploids by
   tetraploids in local populations.}},

Abstract = {{Calcrete aquifers in the arid Yilgarn region of central Western
   Australia are a biodiversity hotspot for stygofauna. A distinct pattern
   of interspecific size class variation among subterranean dytiscid beetle
   species has been observed in 29 of these aquifers where either two or
   three small, medium and/or large sympatric species are found that are in
   some cases sister species. We used a 3.5 km(2) grid of bores to sample
   dytiscids on a fine-scale and employed a comparative phylogeographical
   and population genetic approach to investigate the origins of a
   sympatric sister species triplet of diving beetles from a single
   aquifer. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the Cytochrome oxidase c
   subunit I gene revealed that all three species have high levels of
   haplotype diversity with ancient (similar to 1 million years ago)
   intra-specific coalescence of haplotypes, but low levels of nucleotide
   diversity. Population analyses provide evidence for multiple expansion
   events within each species. There was spatial heterogeneity in the
   distribution of genetic variation and abundance both within and among
   the three taxa. Population analyses revealed significant fine-scale
   differentiation with isolation by distance for Paroster macrosturtensis
   and P. mesosturtensis, but not the smallest species P. microsturtensis.
   Haplotype network analyses provided limited or no evidence for past
   population fragmentation within the large and small species, but
   substantial historical divergence was observed in P. mesosturtensis that
   was not spatially structured. A patchy population structure with
   contemporaneous and historical isolation by distance in the three
   species is likely to have been a significant isolating and diversifying
   force, preventing us from ruling out a potential role for allopatric
   divergence during speciation of this beetle sister triplet.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the sequence variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 (mtCOI) gene and the nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacers (ncITS) of the calanoid copepod Acanthodiaptomus
   pacificus in Japan. A. pacificus individuals were divided into three
   divergent mtCOI lineages (mt-A, -B and -C). mt-A was distributed in the
   northernmost part of Japan, from Hokkaido to the northern part of Honshu
   Island, whereas mt-C was the southernmost lineage, distributed from
   central Honshu to Shikoku and Kyushu Islands. mt-B was distributed
   between these former two lineages, resulting in parapatry with mt-C and
   mt-A. In all lineages, 80\% of the localities were fixed for a single
   haplotype, and different localities tended to have different haplotypes.
   The degree of genetic differentiation among these lineages (15-22\%) was
   at an interspecific level, according to the criteria of the DNA barcode
   technique. However, the topology of ncITS was not congruent with that of
   mtCOI, as the reciprocal monophyly was not observed within mt-B and
   mt-C. Therefore, we merged them into the Southern Lineage and separated
   it from the Northern Lineage (i.e. mt-A). Evidence of introgression was
   found within the Southern Lineage, while gene flow was not observed
   between the Northern and Southern Lineages, suggesting that A. pacificus
   is a cryptic species complex. We also argue that genetic
   differentiations of A. pacificus in Japan may reflect the history of
   separation, transgression and regression of the landmass during the
   formation of current Japanese Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA data and a population genetic
   approach, we tested male-mediated gene flow in the toad-headed lizards
   Phrynocephalus przewalskii. The mitochondrial DNA (ND2 gene), on the one
   hand, revealed two major lineages and a strong population genetic
   structure (F(ST) = 0.692; F(ST)' = 0.995). The pairwise differences
   between the two lineages ranged from 2.1\% to 6.4\% and the geographical
   division of the two lineages coincided with a mountain chain consisting
   of the Helan and Yin Mountains, suggesting a historical vicariant
   pattern. On the other hand, the nuclear microsatellite DNA revealed a
   significant but small population genetic structure (F(ST) = 0.017;
   F(ST)' = 0.372). The pairwise F(ST) among the nine populations examined
   with seven microsatellite DNA loci ranged from 0.0062 to 0.0266; the
   assignment test failed to detect any naturally occurring population
   clusters. Furthermore, the populations demonstrated a weak isolation by
   distance and a northeast to southwest clinal variation, rather than a
   vicariant pattern. A historical vicariant event followed by
   male-mediated gene flow appears to be the best explanation for the data.
   Approximately 2-5 Ma, climatic change may have created an uninhabitable
   zone along the Helan-Yin mountain chain and initiated the divergence
   between the two mitochondrial lineages. With further climatic changes,
   males were able to disperse across the mountain chain, causing
   sufficient gene flow that eventually erased the vicariant pattern and
   drastically reduced the population genetic structure, while females
   remained philopatric and maintained the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   divergence. Although polygyny mating system and female philopatry may
   partially contribute to the reduced movement of females, other
   hypotheses, such as female intrasexual aggression, should also be
   explored.}},

Abstract = {{The alpine white-flowered buttercup, Ranunculus kuepferi Greuter \&
   Burdet, is a polyploid complex with diploids endemic to the southwestern
   Alps and polyploids - which have been previously described as apomictic
   - widespread throughout European mountains. Due to the polymorphic
   status of both its ploidy level and its reproductive mode, R. kuepferi
   represents a key species for understanding the evolution of polyploid
   lineages in alpine habitats. To disentangle the phylogeography of this
   polyploid taxon, we used cpDNA sequences and AFLP (amplified fragment
   length polymorphism) markers in 33 populations of R. kuepferi
   representative of its ploidy level and distribution area. Polyploid
   individuals were shown to be the result of at least two polyploidization
   events that may have taken place in the southwestern Alps. From this
   region, one single main migration of tetraploids colonized the entire
   Alpine range, the Apennines and Corsica. Genetic recombination among
   tetraploids was also observed, revealing the facultative nature of the
   apomictic reproductive mode in R. kuepferi polyploids. Our study shows
   the contrasting role played by diploid lineages mostly restricted to
   persistent refugia and by tetraploids, whose dispersal abilities have
   permitted their range extension all over the previously glaciated Alpine
   area and throughout neighbouring mountain massifs.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are many reasons to expect distinct pollinator types to
   differentially affect a plant's reproductive success, few studies have
   directly examined this question. Here, we contrast the impact of two
   kinds of pollinators on reproductive success via male and female
   functions in the Rocky Mountain columbine, Aquilegia coerulea. We set up
   pollinator exclusion treatments in each of three patches where Aquilegia
   plants were visited by either day pollinators (majority bumble bees), by
   evening pollinators (hawkmoths), or by both (control). Day pollinators
   collected pollen and groomed, whereas evening pollinators collected
   nectar but did not groom. Maternal parents, potential fathers and
   progeny arrays were genotyped at five microsatellite loci. We estimated
   female outcrossing rate and counted seeds to measure female reproductive
   success and used paternity analysis to determine male reproductive
   success. Our results document that bumble bees frequently moved pollen
   among patches of plants and that, unlike hawkmoths, pollen moved by
   bumble bees sired more outcrossed seeds when it remained within a patch
   as opposed to moving between patches. Pollinator type differentially
   affected the outcrossing rate but not seed set, the number of outcrossed
   seeds or overall male reproductive success. Multiple visits to a plant
   and more frequent visits by bumble bees could help to explain the lack
   of impact of pollinator type on overall reproductive success. The
   increase in selfing rate with hawkmoths likely resulted from the
   abundant pollen available in experimental flowers. Our findings
   highlighted a new type of pollinator interactions that can benefit a
   plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Both ecological and molecular methods have been applied to the study of

   on the invasive species Avena barbata is a classic example of using

   (reciprocal environment studies) with quantitative genetic techniques
   (recombinant inbred lines and quantitative trait analysis) to provide
   new evidence for local adaptation within this well known system. The
   conclusions are orthogonal to the original hypothesis, and instead,
   provide evidence that factors other than local adaptation were likely
   responsible for the historically observed patterns. This new evidence
   suggests that one ecotype is generally more fit than the other in both a
   moist and a dry environment, and accordingly, it appears to be
   increasing in frequency in historically surveyed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Founder populations in reintroduction programmes can experience a
   genetic bottleneck simply because of their small size. The influence of
   reproductive skew brought on by polygynous or polyandrous mating systems
   in these populations can exacerbate already difficult conservation
   genetic problems, such as inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive
   potential. Without an understanding of reproductive skew in a target
   species, and the effect it can have on genetic diversity retained over
   generations, long-term conservation goals will be compromised. In this
   issue of Molecular Ecology, Miller et al. (2009a) test how founder group
   size and variance in male reproductive success influence the maintenance
   of genetic diversity following reintroduction on a long-term scale. They
   evaluated genetic diversity in two wild populations of the iconic New
   Zealand tuatara (Fig. 1), which differ greatly in population size and
   genetic diversity, and compared this to genetic diversity in multiple
   founder populations sourced from both populations. Population viability
   analysis on the maintenance of genetic diversity over 400 years (10
   generations) demonstrated that while the loss of heterozygosity was low
   when compared with both source populations (1-14\%), the greater the
   male reproductive skew, the greater the predicted losses of genetic
   diversity. Importantly however, the loss of genetic diversity was
   ameliorated after population size exceeded 250 animals, regardless of
   the level of reproductive skew. This study demonstrates that highly
   informed conservation decisions could be made when you build on a solid
   foundation of demographic, natural history and behavioural ecology data.
   These data, when informed by modern population and genetic analysis,
   mean that fundamental applied conservation questions (how many animals
   should make up a founder population?) can be answered accurately and
   with an eye to the long-term consequences of management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is the development of different phenotypes from a
   single genotype, depending on the environment. Such plasticity is a
   pervasive feature of life, is observed for various traits and is often
   argued to be the result of natural selection. A thorough study of
   phenotypic plasticity should thus include an ecological and an
   evolutionary perspective. Recent advances in large-scale gene expression
   technology make it possible to also study plasticity from a molecular
   perspective, and the addition of these data will help answer
   long-standing questions about this widespread phenomenon. In this
   review, we present examples of integrative studies that illustrate the
   molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plastic traits, and show
   how new techniques will grow in importance in the study of these plastic
   molecular processes. These techniques include: (i) heterologous
   hybridization to DNA microarrays; (ii) next generation sequencing
   technologies applied to transcriptomics; (iii) techniques for studying
   the function of noncoding small RNAs; and (iv) proteomic tools. We also
   present recent studies on genetic model systems that uncover how
   environmental cues triggering different plastic responses are sensed and
   integrated by the organism. Finally, we describe recent work on changes
   in gene expression in response to an environmental cue that persist
   after the cue is removed. Such long-term responses are made possible by
   epigenetic molecular mechanisms, including DNA methylation. The results
   of these current studies help us outline future avenues for the study of
   plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Forty years ago, Robert Allard and colleagues documented that the
   slender wild oat, Avena barbata, occurred in California as two
   multi-locus allozyme genotypes, associated with mesic and xeric
   habitats. This is arguably the first example of ecotypes identified by
   molecular techniques. Despite widespread citation, however, the
   inference of local adaptation of these ecotypes rested primarily on the
   allozyme pattern. This study tests for local adaptation of these
   ecotypes using reciprocal transplant and quantitative trait locus (QTL)
   mapping techniques. Both ecotypes and 188 recombinant inbred lines
   (RILs) derived from a cross between them were grown in common garden
   plots established at two sites representative of the environments in
   which the ecotypes were first described. Across four growing seasons at
   each site, three observations consistently emerged. First, despite
   significant genotype by environment interaction, the mesic ecotype
   consistently showed higher lifetime reproductive success across all
   years and sites. Second, the RILs showed no evidence of a trade-off in
   performance across sites or years, and fitness was positively correlated
   across environments. Third, at QTL affecting lifetime reproductive
   success, selection favoured the same allele in all environments. None of
   these observations are consistent with local adaptation but suggest that
   a single genotype is selectively favoured at both moist and dry sites. I
   propose an alternative hypothesis that A. barbata may be an example of
   contemporary evolution - whereby the favoured genotype is spreading and
   increasing in frequency - rather than local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced genetic diversity can result in short-term decreases in fitness
   and reduced adaptive potential, which may lead to an increased
   extinction risk. Therefore, maintaining genetic variation is important
   for the short- and long-term success of reintroduced populations. Here,
   we evaluate how founder group size and variance in male reproductive
   success influence the long-term maintenance of genetic diversity after
   reintroduction. We used microsatellite data to quantify the loss of
   heterozygosity and allelic diversity in the founder groups from three
   reintroductions of tuatara (Sphenodon), the sole living representatives
   of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia. We then estimated the
   maintenance of genetic diversity over 400 years (similar to 10
   generations) using population viability analyses. Reproduction of
   tuatara is highly skewed, with as few as 30\% of males mating across
   years. Predicted losses of heterozygosity over 10 generations were low
   (1-14\%), and populations founded with more animals retained a greater
   proportion of the heterozygosity and allelic diversity of their source
   populations and founder groups. Greater male reproductive skew led to
   greater predicted losses of genetic diversity over 10 generations, but
   only accelerated the loss of genetic diversity at small population size
   (< 250 animals). A reduction in reproductive skew at low density may
   facilitate the maintenance of genetic diversity in small reintroduced
   populations. If reproductive skew is high and density-independent,
   larger founder groups could be released to achieve genetic goals for
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Drought is the main selection agent in Mediterranean ecosystems and it
   has been suggested as an important evolutionary force responsible for
   population diversification in these types of environments. However,
   population divergence in quantitative traits can be driven by either
   natural selection, genetic drift or both. To investigate the roles of
   these forces on among-population divergence in ecophysiological traits
   related to drought tolerance (carbon isotope discrimination, specific
   leaf area, leaf size and leaf nitrogen content), we compared molecular
   and quantitative genetic differentiation in a common garden experiment
   including thirteen cork oak (Quercus suber L.) populations across a
   gradient of rainfall and temperature. Population differentiation for
   height, specific leaf area, leaf size and nitrogen leaf content measured
   during a dry year far exceeded the molecular differentiation measured by
   six nuclear microsatellites. Populations from dry-cool sites showed the
   lowest nitrogen leaf content and the smallest and thickest leaves
   contrasting with those from humid-warm sites. These results suggest (i)
   these traits are subjected to divergence selection and (ii) the genetic
   differences among populations are partly due to climate adaptation. By
   contrast, the low among-population divergence found in basal diameter,
   annual growth and carbon isotopic discrimination (a surrogate for water
   use efficiency) suggests low or no divergence selection for these
   traits. Among-population differentiation for neutral markers was not a
   good predictor for differentiation regarding the quantitative traits
   studied here, except for leaf size. The correlation observed between the
   genetic differentiation for leaf size and that for molecular markers was
   exclusively due to the association between leaf size and the
   microsatellite QpZAG46, which suggests a possible linkage between
   QpZAG46 and genes encoding for leaf size.}},

Abstract = {{The European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi has been a field model
   for cytoplasmic incompatibility since the mid 1970s. Two Wolbachia
   strains were detected in this tephritid species and wCer2 was described
   as the CI inducing agent dividing European populations into two
   unidirectional incompatible groups, i.e. southern females produce viable
   offspring with northern males, whereas the reciprocal cross results in
   incompatibility. We detected three new Wolbachia strains by sequencing a
   multitude of plasmids derived from Wolbachia surface protein gene (wsp)
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Strain-specific primers were
   developed allowing individual diagnosis without need for cloning.
   Hybridization of specific PCR products with a wsp oligonucleotide
   enhanced the detection limit significantly and revealed the presence of
   low-titre infections in some strains, in different ontogenetic stages
   and in adults of different age. We then performed a survey of strain
   prevalence and infection frequency in eight European regions. wCer1 was
   fixed in all populations, whereas wCer2 was detected only in the South.
   wCer3 frequency was the lowest without a clear distribution pattern. The
   abundance of wCer4 was homogenous across Europe. Like wCer2, wCer5
   showed significant differences in spatial distribution. Our new findings
   of previously undetected and recombinant Wolbachia strains in R. cerasi
   reveal a major caveat to the research community not to overlook hidden
   Wolbachia diversity in field populations. Low-titres and geographical
   variability in Wolbachia diversity are expected to influence the outcome
   of Wolbachia population dynamics and Wolbachia-based insect population
   control and may create invasion barriers for expanding and artificially
   introduced Wolbachia strains.}},

Abstract = {{The Tibetan Plateau is one of the top 10 biodiversity hotspots in the
   world and acts as a modern harbour for many rare species because of its
   relatively pristine state. In this article, we report a landscape
   genetic study on the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), a
   primate endemic to the Tibetan Plateau. DNA was extracted from blood,
   tissue and fecal samples of 135 wild individuals representing 11 out of
   15 extant monkey groups. Ten microsatellite loci were used to
   characterize patterns of genetic diversity. The most striking feature of
   the population structure is the presence of five subpopulations with
   distinct genetic backgrounds and unique spatial regions. The population
   structure of R. bieti appears to be shaped by anthropogenic landscape
   features as gene flow between subpopulations is strongly impeded by
   arable land, highways and human habitation. A partial Mantel test showed
   that 36.23\% (r = 0.51, P = 0.01) of the genetic distance was explained
   by habitat gaps after controlling for the effect of geographical
   distance. Only 4.92\% of the genetic distance was explained by
   geographical distance in the partial Mantel test, and no significant
   correlation was found. Estimation of population structure history
   indicates that environmental change during the last glacial maximum and
   human impacts since the Holocene, or a combination of both, have shaped
   the observed population structure of R. bieti. Increasing human activity
   on the Plateau, especially that resulting in habitat fragmentation, is
   becoming an important factor in shaping the genetic structure and
   evolutionary potential of species inhabiting this key ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental variables can strongly influence a variety of intra- and
   inter-population processes, including demography, population structure
   and gene flow. When environmental conditions are particularly harsh for
   a certain species, investigating these effects is important to
   understanding how populations persist under difficult conditions.
   Furthermore, species inhabiting challenging environments present
   excellent opportunities to examine the effects of complex landscapes on
   population processes because these effects will often be more
   pronounced. In this study, I use 16 microsatellite loci to examine
   population structure, gene flow and demographic history in the black
   toad, Bufo exsul, which has one of the most restricted natural ranges of
   any amphibian. Bufo exsul inhabits four springs in the Deep Springs
   Valley high desert basin and has never been observed more than several
   meters from any source of water. My results reveal limited gene flow and
   moderately high levels of population structure (F-ST = 0.051-0.063)
   between all but the two closest springs. I found that the geographic
   distance across the arid scrub habitat between springs is significantly
   correlated with genetic structure when distance accounts for topography
   and barriers to dispersal. I also found very low effective population
   sizes (N-e = 7-30) and substantial evidence for historical population
   bottlenecks in all four populations. Together, these results suggest
   that the desert landscape and B. exsul's high habitat specificity
   contribute significantly to population structure and demography in this
   species and emphasize the importance of considering behavioural and
   landscape data in conservation genetic studies of natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of metabolites to environmental fluctuations may play large
   roles in biological adaptation, yet how these responses initiate in the
   natural environment and the molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
   Synthesis of floral anthocyanins, as typical examples of secondary
   metabolites, is known to respond to the physical environment and
   therefore an ideal system for understanding the process of the
   environmental regulation. Here, by simultaneous monitoring of six
   natural environmental variables and anthocyanin content of daily opening
   flowers throughout a natural flowering season (similar to 50 days) of
   Ipomoea purpurea, we have identified significant and positive
   correlations of temperature (3-days ago) and ultraviolet (UV) light
   intensity (5-days ago) with the floral anthocyanin content. We sequenced
   all known (seven structural and three regulatory) anthocyanin genes in
   I. purpurea flowers and examined their transcript quantities in the
   natural environment across eight floral developmental stages (covering
   0-96 h before anthesis). The anthocyanin gene expression patterns
   corroborated with the inferred effects from the time-series data, and
   further showed that the positive UV effect became negative on transcript
   levels about 36 h before anthesis. With falling natural temperature,
   content of the principal anthocyanin declined, whereas that of an
   alternative anthocyanin with fewer glucose and caffeic acid moieties
   increased. Our data suggest that environmental regulation of the
   anthocyanin pathway may account for more than half of the flux variation
   in the floral limb, and is influenced mainly by daily average
   temperature and UV light intensity that modulate anthocyanin transcript
   levels (most likely via myb1) at floral developmental stages.}},

Abstract = {{The Batesian mimetic swallowtail butterfly Papilio dardanus exhibits
   numerous distinct wing colour morphs whose evolutionary origins require
   large phenotypic shifts. A phylogenetic framework to study the history
   of these morphs was established by DNA sequencing of representative
   subspecies from sub-Saharan Africa and Indian Ocean islands. Two
   mitochondrial genes and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer marker
   revealed deeply separated eastern and western African mainland lineages,
   plus one lineage each on Madagascar and Grande Comore. These markers
   showed very little polymorphism within lineages. In contrast, markers
   genetically linked to the mimicry locus H, including the transcription
   factor invected and two adjacent amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms-derived sequences, showed high nucleotide diversity but
   were not geographically structured. Variation in the unlinked wingless
   gene showed a similar pattern, rejecting the hypothesis that high level
   of variation in the H region is due to balancing selection exerted by
   the phenotypes. The separation from a common ancestor with Papilio
   phorcas estimated at 2.9 Ma coincides with the origin of a mimicry
   model, Danaus chrysippus. However, the model reached Africa only at the
   time of the internal splits of P. dardanus mtDNA groups, here estimated
   at 0.55-0.94 Ma. The nuclear genome shows less geographic structure and
   may not track recent population differentiation, suggesting that
   widespread mimicry morphs have arisen early in the evolution of the P.
   dardanus lineage, although after the male-female dimorphism which is
   ancestral. The current wide distribution of P. dardanus and population
   subdivision evident from mtDNA may have been achieved only with the
   spread of the models across Africa.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that species living in small lentic water
   bodies, because of the short-term geological persistence of their
   habitat, should show higher dispersal ability, with increased gene flow
   among populations and a less pronounced phylogeographical structure.
   Conversely, lotic species, living in more geologically stable habitats,
   should show reduced dispersal and an increased phylogeographical
   structure at the same geographical scales. In this work we tested the
   influence of habitat type in two groups of aquatic Coleoptera
   (Nebrioporus ceresyi and Ochthebius notabilis groups, families
   Dytiscidae and Hydraenidae respectively), each of them with closely
   related species typical of lotic and lentic saline Western Mediterranean
   water bodies. We used mitochondrial cox1 sequence data of 453 specimens
   of 77 populations through the range of nine species to compare a lotic
   vs. a lentic lineage in each of the two groups. Despite the differences
   in biology (predators vs. detritivorous) and evolutionary history, in
   both lotic lineages there was a higher proportion of nucleotide
   diversity among than within groups of populations, and a faster rate of
   accumulation of haplotype diversity (as measured by rarefaction curves)
   than in the lentic lineages. Similarly, lotic lineages had a higher
   absolute phylogenetic diversity, more remarkable considering their
   smaller absolute geographical ranges. By comparing closely related
   species, we were able to show the effect of contrasting habitat
   preferences in two different groups, in agreement with predictions
   derived from habitat stability.}},

Abstract = {{The use of sequence polymorphism from individual mitochondrial genes to
   infer past demography has recently proved controversial because of the
   recurrence of selective sweeps acting over genes and the need for
   unlinked multilocus data sets. However, comparative analyses using
   several species for one gene and/or multiple genes for one species can
   serve as a test for potential selective effects and clarify our
   understanding of historical demographic effects. This study compares
   nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I across
   seven deep-sea hydrothermal vent species that live along the
   volcanically active East Pacific Rise. Approximate Bayesian Computation
   (ABC) method, developed to trace shared vicariant events across species
   pairs, indicates the occurrence of two across species divergence times,
   and suggests that the present geographical patterns of genetic
   differentiation may be explained by two periods of significant
   population isolation. The oldest period dates back 11.6 Ma and is
   associated with the vent limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, while the most
   recent period of isolation is 1.3 Ma, which apparently affected all
   species examined and coincides with a transition zone across the
   equator. Moreover, significant negative Tajima's D and star-like
   networks were observed for all southern lineages, suggesting that these
   lineages experienced a concomitant demographic and geographical
   expansion about 100 000-300 000 generations ago. This expansion may have
   initiated from a wave of range expansions during the secondary
   colonization of new sites along the Southern East Pacific Rise (founder
   effects below the equator) or recurrent bottleneck events because of the
   increase of eruptive phases associated with the higher spreading rates
   of the ridge in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Recent human activities have spread numerous plant species across the
   globe, yet it is unclear to what degree historical human activities
   influenced plant dispersal. In western North America, Camassia quamash
   was one of the most important food plants for indigenous peoples, who
   transported its propagules either intentionally or accidentally. We
   investigated how human and natural dispersal might have contributed to
   the current pattern of spatial genetic structure in C. quamash by
   performing phylogeographical surveys at two geographical scales. We
   sequenced two noncoding regions of chloroplast deoxyribonucleic acid
   (DNA) in 226 individuals from 53 populations of C. quamash as well as
   126 individuals from 21 populations of the non-food plant Zigadenus
   venenosus. Contrary to the expectation of anthropogenic transport, C.
   quamash populations did not exhibit weaker genetic structure than Z.
   venenosus populations. We also failed to find convincing evidence for
   signatures of transport. Instead, our data showed strong effects of past
   glaciation and geographical barriers of the mountains in the Cascade
   Range, Olympic Peninsula and Vancouver Island. West of the Cascades, the
   species appears to have largely migrated northward from a southern
   refugium after deglaciation, whereas few populations having a highly
   divergent haplotype might have survived in southwestern Washington. Our
   data suggest that despite substantial ethnobotanical evidence for
   anthropogenic transport, the current pattern of genetic structure of C.
   quamash does not show any detectable signatures of transport by
   indigenous peoples and is better understood as the result of natural
   dispersal processes.}},

Abstract = {{In socially monogamous species, males that risk cuckoldry more than
   others might gain inclusive fitness by yielding paternity to relatives.
   We tested this prediction in the Tibetan ground tit Pseudopodoces
   humilis, an unusual facultative cooperative breeder wherein most helpers
   (87\% males) join a mated pair shortly before clutch completion.
   Extra-pair paternity among bi-parental broods occurred less often (26\%
   of broods, 9\% of young) compared with cooperative broods (68\%, 25\%).
   In the former, most extra-pair sires (88\%) were pair breeders unrelated
   to the cuckolded males, whereas in the latter, sires (87\%) were mainly
   helpers related to the dominant males. Brood productivity did not differ
   between the bi-parental and cooperative breeders, but helpers'
   partitioning over group paternity reduced the realized reproductive
   success of helped males. After taking inclusive fitness into account,
   however, there was no difference in success of dominant males between
   the two social systems. One possible explanation for the differences in
   the rates of cuckoldry in the two systems was body size, because
   pair-bond males in bi-parental situations were significantly larger than
   those in cooperative ones. We propose two alternative strategies for
   males to maximize fitness: breed as a pair if large to avoid cuckoldry
   from helpers, or breed cooperatively if small but compromise some
   paternity to relatives. Our results provide an unusual route to the
   incidence of cooperative groups, based on constraints imposed by low
   competitive ability of breeding males rather than some external
   ecological or demographic factors.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{18}},

Abstract = {{One of the major controversies in evolutionary biology concerns the
   processes underlying macroevolutionary patterns in which prolonged
   stasis is disrupted by rapid, short-term evolution that leads species to
   new adaptive zones. Recent advances in the understanding of contemporary
   evolution have suggested that such rapid evolution can occur in the wild
   as a result of environmental changes. Here, we examined a novel
   hypothesis that evolutionary stasis is punctuated by co-evolutionary
   arms races, which continuously alter adaptive peaks and landscapes.
   Based on the phylogeny of long-mouthed weevils in the genus Curculio,
   likelihood ratio tests showed that the macroevolutionary pattern of the
   weevils coincides with the punctuational evolution model. A coalescent
   analysis of a species, Curculio camelliae, the mouthpart of which has
   diverged considerably among populations because of an arms race with its
   host plant, further suggested that major evolutionary shifts had

Abstract = {{There is now substantial and growing evidence for a role of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) in shaping individual mate preferences.
   In view of both its codominant expression and its function in immune
   response, it is often expected that females aim to avoid inbreeding or
   maximize offspring MHC-heterozygosity by selecting as mates those males
   which share fewest or no MHC alleles with themselves. However, it is
   becoming increasingly clear that this view is over-simplistic: not only
   is MHC dissimilarity just one of several (perhaps many) criteria
   important in mate choice decision-making, extremely MHC-dissimilar males
   may be avoided, and furthermore, specific alleles or combinations might
   be preferred if they bestow particular advantages. These points are
   raised in two papers in this Molecular Ecology issue, in which patterns
   of reproductive success in tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are each inconsistent
   with a generalized preference for MHC dissimilarity. Together, these
   studies demonstrate several adaptive reasons for decision rules that do
   not necessarily result in maximizing mate dissimilarity.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of adaptive evolution have experienced a recent revival in
   population genetics of natural populations and there is currently much
   focus on identifying genomic signatures of selection in space and time.
   Insights into local adaptation, adaptive response to global change and
   evolutionary consequences of selective harvesting can be generated
   through population genomics studies, allowing the separation of the
   effects invoked by neutral processes (drift-migration) from those due to
   selection. Such knowledge is important not only for improving our basic
   understanding of natural as well as human-induced evolutionary
   processes, but also for predicting future trajectories of biodiversity
   and for setting conservation priorities. Marine fishes possess a number
   of features rendering them well suited for providing general insights
   into adaptive genomic evolution in natural populations. These include
   well-described population structures, substantial and rapidly developing
   genomic resources and abundant archived samples enabling temporal
   studies. Furthermore, superior possibilities for conducting large-scale
   experiments under controlled conditions, due to the economic resources
   provided by the large and growing aquaculture industry, hold great
   promise for utilizing recent technological developments. Here, we review
   achievements in marine fish genomics to date and highlight potential
   avenues for future research, which will provide both general insights
   into evolution in high gene flow species, as well as specific knowledge
   which can lead to improved management of marine organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Population structuring in the North Atlantic deepwater demersal fish
   tusk (Brosme brosme) was studied with microsatellite DNA analyses.
   Screening eight samples from across the range of the species for seven
   loci revealed low but significant genetic heterogeneity (F(ST) =
   0.0014). Spatial genetic variability was only weakly related to
   geographical (Euclidean) distance between study sites or separation of
   study sites along the path of major ocean currents. Instead, we found a
   significant effect of habitat, indicated by significant differentiation
   between relatively closely spaced sites: Rockall, which is surrounded by
   very deep water (> 1000 m), and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is
   separated from the European slope by a deep ocean basin, were
   differentiated from relatively homogeneous sites across the Nordic Seas.
   Limited adult migration across bathymetric barriers in combination with
   limited intersite exchange of pelagic eggs and larvae due to
   site-specific circulatory retention or poor survival during drift phases
   across deep basins may be reducing gene flow. We regard these
   limitations to gene flow as the most likely mechanisms for the observed
   population structure in this demersal species. The results underscore
   the importance of habitat boundaries in marine species.}},

Abstract = {{We use 14 microsatellite loci to investigate the impact of a viral
   disease (Ranavirus) on the population genetic structure of wild common
   frogs (Rana temporaria). Populations with a history of Ranavirus
   mortalities (and 83\% declines in the number of frogs) were compared
   with populations with no history of infection. Infected ponds showed
   significantly elevated F(IS) (homozygote excess), significantly reduced
   relatedness, and no detectable effect on allelic richness. We
   hypothesize that the elevated F(IS) and reduced relatedness are
   consequences of assortative mating, and that allelic richness is
   maintained by immigration from nearby populations. Simulations indicate
   that the elevated F(IS) cannot be explained by population size
   reductions, but can indeed be explained by assortative mating (even if a
   mate choice locus is unlinked to the genetic markers). While the
   majority of studies consider demographic outcomes following disease
   outbreaks, our results indicate that emerging infectious diseases could
   also result in behavioural changes.}},

Abstract = {{The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is a critically endangered
   felid that suffered a severe demographic contraction in the 1940s. In
   this study, we sampled 95 individuals collected throughout their native
   range to investigate questions relative to population genetic structure
   and demographic history. Additionally, we sampled targeted individuals
   from the North American ex situ population to assess the genetic
   representation found in captivity. Population genetic and Bayesian
   structure analyses clearly identified two populations separated by a
   development corridor in Russia. Despite their well-documented 20th
   century decline, we failed to find evidence of a recent population
   bottleneck, although genetic signatures of a historical contraction were
   detected. This disparity in signal may be due to several reasons,
   including historical paucity in population genetic variation associated
   with postglacial colonization and potential gene flow from a now
   extirpated Chinese population. Despite conflicting signatures of a
   bottleneck, our estimates of effective population size (N(e) = 27-35)
   and N(e)/N ratio (0.07-0.054) were substantially lower than the only
   other values reported for a wild tiger population. Lastly, the extent
   and distribution of genetic variation in captive and wild populations
   were similar, yet gene variants persisted ex situ that were lost in
   situ. Overall, our results indicate the need to secure ecological
   connectivity between the two Russian populations to minimize loss of
   genetic diversity and overall susceptibility to stochastic events, and
   support a previous study suggesting that the captive population may be a
   reservoir of gene variants lost in situ.}},

   (Anaxyrus cognatus) and Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii). For
   both species, we find limited genetic differentiation even between
   populations in adjacent valleys separated by dispersal barriers such as
   mountainous habitats. To understand how population genetic patterns in
   these two arid-adapted species compare to taxa in more mesic
   environments, we computed a standardized measure of population
   differentiation for A. cognatus, S. couchii, and for pond-breeding
   amphibians that inhabit mesic temperate environments. Our results
   indicate that the arid-adapted species have lower population genetic
   structure at fine and moderate scales than most other amphibian species
   we surveyed. We hypothesize that stochasticity in the availability of
   appropriate breeding sites as well as landscape homogeneity may result
   in increased population connectivity in desert-adapted frogs. Future
   work examining fine-scale population structure in amphibians from a
   diversity of habitats will test the generality of our findings.
   Intraspecific comparisons among localities with varied seasonality and
   habitats will be particularly useful for investigating the interaction
   between species-typical population dynamics and environmental
   characteristics as determinants of population connectivity in
   pond-breeding amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{Introgression arising from crop-to-wild gene flow provides novel sources
   of genetic variation in plant species complexes. Hybridization within
   the Beta vulgaris species complex is of immediate concern; crop lineages
   (B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) hybridize easily with their wild relatives
   (B. vulgaris ssp. maritima) thereby threatening wild beet gene diversity
   with genetic swamping. Hybridization `hotspots' occur in European seed
   production areas because inland ruderal wild beets occur and reproduce
   in sympatry with cultivated beets. We studied gene flow occurring
   between seed-producing cultivars and ruderal wild B. vulgaris in
   southwestern France to determine whether feral beets, arising from
   unharvested cultivated seed, represent an opportunity for crop-to-wild
   gene flow. We surveyed 42 inland ruderal beet populations located near
   seed production fields for nucleo-cytoplasmic variation and used a
   cytoplasmic marker diagnostic of cultivated lines. Occurrence of
   cultivated-type cytoplasm within ruderal populations clearly reflected
   events of crop seed escape. However, we found no genetic signatures of
   nuclear cultivated gene introgression, which suggests past introgression
   of cultivated cytoplasm into a wild nuclear background through seed
   escape rather than recent direct pollen flow. Overall, patterns of
   genetic structure suggested that inland ruderal wild beet populations
   act as a metapopulation, with founding events involving a few sib
   groups, followed by low rates of seed or pollen gene flow after
   populations are established. Altogether, our results indicate that a
   long-lived seed bank plays a key role in maintaining cultivated-type
   cytoplasm in the wild and highlight the need for careful management of
   seed production areas where wild and cultivated relatives co-occur.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of hybrids in plant invasions can indicate a potential for
   rapid adaptation and an added level of complexity in management of the
   invasion. Three Casuarina tree species, Casuarina glauca, Casuarina
   cunninghamiana and Casuarina equisetifolia, native to Australia, are
   naturalized in Florida, USA. Many Florida Casuarina trees are considered
   unidentifiable, presumably due to interspecific hybridization. We
   collected tissue from over 500 trees from Australia and Florida and
   genotyped these using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Our goal
   was to determine the exact identity of the Florida species, including
   any putative hybrid combinations. In Australia, we found high assignment
   values to the three parental species, and no evidence of hybridization.
   In Florida, we found many trees with strong assignment to any one of the
   three species, as well as 49 trees with assignment values intermediate
   to C. glauca and C. equisetifolia, suggesting hybridization between
   these species. One population of 10 trees had assignment values
   intermediate to C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca, suggesting additional
   hybridization. For 69 of these putative hybrid and parental types, we
   sequenced a low-copy intron of nuclear G3pdh, and these sequences
   indicated that some Florida trees contain heterozygotic combinations of
   C. glauca and C. equisetifolia haplotypes. The presence of novel hybrids
   in the Florida invasion may enhance evolution of invasive traits in
   these species. Novel Casuarina hybrids in Florida have no coevolutionary
   history with any insects or diseases, which may be problematic for
   biological control efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Field-selected tolerance to heavy metals has been reported for
   Orchesella cincta (Arthropoda: Collembola) populations occurring at
   metal-contaminated mining sites. This tolerance correlated with
   heritable increase in metal excretion efficiency, less pronounced
   cadmium (Cd)-induced growth reduction and overexpression of the
   metallothionein gene. We applied transcriptomics to determine
   differential gene expression caused by this abiotic stress in reference
   and Cd-tolerant populations. Many cDNAs responded to Cd exposure in the
   reference population. Significantly fewer clones were Cd responsive in
   tolerant animals. Analysis of variance revealed transcripts that
   interact between Cd exposure and population. Hierarchical cluster
   analysis of these clones identified two major groups. The first one
   contained cDNAs that were up-regulated by Cd in the reference culture
   but non-responsive or down-regulated in tolerant animals. This cluster
   was also characterized by elevated constitutive expression in the
   tolerant population. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these cDNAs
   were involved in structural integrity of the cuticle, anti-microbial
   defence, calcium channel-blocking, sulphur assimilation and chromatin
   remodelling. The second group consisted of cDNAs down-regulated in
   reference animals but not responding or slightly up-regulated in
   tolerant animals. Their functions involved carbohydrate metabolic
   processes, Ca(2+)-dependent stress signalling, redox state, proteolysis
   and digestion. The reference population showed a strong signature of
   stress-induced genome-wide perturbation of gene expression, whereas the
   tolerant animals maintained normal gene expression upon Cd exposure. We
   confirmed the micro-evolutionary processes occurring in soil arthropod
   populations and suggest a major contribution of gene regulation to the
   evolution of a stress-adapted phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{A diversity of evolutionary processes can be responsible for generating
   and maintaining biodiversity. Molecular markers were used to investigate
   the influence of Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations on the
   evolutionary history of taxa restricted to the freshwaters of a
   classical glacial refugium. Population genetic, phylogenetic and
   phylogeographical methods allowed the inference of temporal dynamics of
   cladogenesis and processes shaping present-day genetic constitution of
   Barbus sclateri, a polytypic taxon found in several independent river
   drainages in southern Iberian Peninsula. Results from different analyses
   consistently indicate several range expansions, high levels of
   allopatric fragmentation, and admixture following secondary contacts
   throughout its evolutionary history. Using a Bayesian demographical
   coalescent model on mitochondrial DNA sequences calibrated with fossil
   evidence, all cladogenetic events within B. sclateri are inferred to
   have occurred during the Pleistocene and were probably driven by
   environmental factors. Our results suggest that glaciation cycles did
   not inhibit cladogenesis and probably interacted with regional
   geomorphology to promote diversification. We conclude that this
   polytypic taxon is a species complex that recently diversified in
   allopatry, and that Pleistocene glaciation-deglaciation cycles probably
   contributed to the generation of biological diversity in a classical
   glacial refugium with high endemicity.}},

Abstract = {{Black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus) and rose-breasted
   grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus) are passerine bird species known to
   hybridize in the Great Plains of North America. Both extrinsic
   (environmental) and intrinsic factors (pre- and postzygotic reproductive
   isolation) have been credited for the generation and maintenance of the
   grosbeak hybrid zone, but little is known about the genetic
   characteristics of this hybrid zone. To investigate the stability and
   extent of the grosbeak hybrid zone, we constructed clines from both
   molecular sequence data (mtDNA, three autosomal intron loci, and one
   Z-linked locus) and morphological data (morphometric analyses and hybrid
   index scores) to determined zone centre and width. Hybrid zone centre
   and width were also determined for samples collected across the zone 40
   years ago from morphological data. The present and past clines were
   compared and provided support for stability in hybrid zone location and
   width, and the evolutionary implications of this are discussed. Three
   models of hybrid zone maintenance were investigated to consider the
   influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on this zone. Our results
   suggest low hybrid frequencies, a stable zone location and narrow width,
   and reduced hybrid fitness over the past 40 years best categorize the
   grosbeak hybrid zone as a tension zone.}},

Abstract = {{Tsetse flies of the palpalis group are major vectors of Human African
   Trypanosomiasis in Africa. Accurate knowledge of species identity is
   essential for vector control. Here, we combine ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (COI)
   and microsatellites to determine the population structure and
   phylogenetic relations of Glossina p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea. CO1
   sequence data suggest that G. p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea is a
   distinct subspecies from previously described G. p. palpalis in West
   Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. Glossina p. palpalis in
   Equatorial Guinea and DRC share a common ancestor which diverged from
   West African G. p. palpalis around 1.9 Ma. Previous ITS1 length
   polymorphism data suggested the possible presence of hybrids in
   Equatorial Guinea. However, ITS1 showed incomplete lineage sorting
   compared with clearly defined COI groups, and data from 12 unlinked
   microsatellites provided no evidence of hybridization. Microsatellite
   data indicated moderate but significant differentiation between the
   populations analysed (Rio Campo, Mbini and Kogo). Moreover, unlike
   previous studies of G. p. palpalis, there was no evidence for
   heterozygote deficiency, presence of migrants or cryptic population
   structure. Variance effective population size at Rio Campo was estimated
   at 501-731 assuming eight generations per year. This study of the
   population genetics of G. p. palpalis in central Africa provides the
   first estimate of genetic differentiation between geographically
   separated G. p. palpalis populations.}},

Abstract = {{The peracarid isopod, Stenosoma nadejda (Rezig 1989), until recently
   considered to be endemic of the Mediterranean region, was first reported
   in the Atlantic coast of southern Spain in 2001, and in 2006 abundant
   populations were discovered throughout the southwestern Portuguese
   coast. This fast expansion was intriguing because, as a direct brooder,
   this species has limited mechanisms for dispersal, such as rafting on
   seaweeds. Did S. nadejda recently extend its range into the Atlantic or
   was it overlooked in the past? We examined the patterns of genetic
   diversity and population differentiation accordingly by sequencing the
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene from 75 individuals
   collected in five locations in Atlantic Iberia and one in the
   Mediterranean. Our results indicate that the newly discovered Atlantic
   populations of S. nadejda appear to be old and have long persisted on
   Atlantic shores rather than being a recent introduction. High levels of
   genetic diversity and geographic structure were uncovered in what was
   initially suspected to be an `invasive' species. Recent changes in
   population dynamics may have made S. nadejda more conspicuous in the
   Atlantic shores, or a more comprehensive survey led to the recognition
   of this species where it was not expected.}},

Abstract = {{Despite only limited Pleistocene glacial activity in the southern
   hemisphere, temperate forest species experienced complex distributional
   changes resulting from the combined effects of glaciation, sea level
   change and increased aridity. The effects of these historical processes
   on population genetic structure are now overlain by the effects of
   contemporary habitat modification. In this study, 10 microsatellites and
   629 bp of the mitochondrial control region were used to assess the
   effects of historical forest fragmentation and recent anthropogenic
   habitat change on the broad-scale population genetic structuring of a
   southern temperate marsupial, the Tasmanian pademelon. A total of 200
   individuals were sampled from seven sites across Tasmania and two
   islands in Bass Strait. High mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity
   indicated the maintenance of large historical population sizes. There
   was weak phylogeographical structuring of haplotypes, although all King
   Island haplotypes and three Tasmanian haplotypes formed a divergent
   clade implying the mid-Pleistocene isolation of a far northwestern
   population. Both the mitochondrial and nuclear data indicated a division
   of Tasmanian populations into eastern and western regions. This was
   consistent with a historical barrier resulting from increased aridity in
   the lowland `midlands' region during glacial periods, and with a
   contemporary barrier resulting from recent habitat modification in that
   region. In Tasmania, gene flow appears to have been relatively
   unrestricted during glacial maxima in the west, while in the east there
   was evidence for historical expansion from at least one large glacial
   refuge and recolonization of Flinders Island.}},

Abstract = {{Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles likely have adaptive
   value because of overdominance, in which case MHC heterozygous
   individuals have increased fitness relative to homozygotes. Because of
   this potential benefit, the evolution of sexual reproduction between
   MHC-divergent individuals (i.e. negative assortative mating, NAM) may be
   favoured. However, the strongest evidence for MHC-based NAM comes from
   inbred animals, and context-dependent mating preferences have rarely
   been evaluated although they often occur in nature. We assessed the
   extent MHC-based mating preferences among wild tiger salamanders
   (Ambystoma tigrinum) using multiple molecular approaches. We genotyped
   102 adults and 864 larvae from 36 breeding trials at both microsatellite
   and MHC loci. Parentage analysis revealed that reproductive success
   among males was positively associated with increased tail length and
   that with respect to the focal female, MHC-similar males sired a
   significantly higher number of offspring than more dissimilar males.
   This trend was consistent, even under context-dependent scenarios that
   favour traditional MHC-based NAM. These results suggest that the most
   MHC-divergent males may be at a reproductive disadvantage in pairwise
   breeding trials. Our data add to a growing body of evidence that
   suggests where it exists, MHC-based choice is probably dynamic and
   mediated by many factors that vary in the wild, notably signals from
   other indicator traits and by the quality and quantity of potential
   mates.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are
   regarded as essential genes for individual fitness under conditions of
   natural and sexual selection. To test this hypothesis, we investigated
   the ultimate individual fitness trait - that of reproductive success. We
   used three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in seminatural
   enclosures, located in natural breeding areas where the experimental
   fish had been caught. During their reproductive period, fish were
   exposed continuously to their natural sympatric parasites. By genotyping
   almost 4000 eggs with nine microsatellites, we determined parenthood and
   inferred female mating decision. We found that with reference to their
   own MHC profile, female sticklebacks preferred to mate with males
   sharing an intermediate MHC diversity. In addition, males with a
   specific MHC haplotype were bigger and better at fighting a common
   parasite (Gyrodactylus sp.). This translated directly into Darwinian
   fitness since fish harbouring this specific MHC haplotype were more
   likely to be chosen and had a higher reproductive output. We conclude
   that females also based their mating decision on a specific MHC
   haplotype conferring resistance against a common parasite. This
   identifies and supports `good genes'. We argue that such an interaction
   between host and parasite driving assortative mating is not only a
   prerequisite for negative frequency-dependent selection - a potential
   mechanism to explain the maintenance of MHC polymorphism, but also
   potentially speciation.}},

Abstract = {{The process of speciation remains a fundamental topic in evolutionary
   biology. Numerous models of speciation have been proposed and they are
   as diverse and colourful as the scientists who conceived them (Coyne \&
   Orr 2004). One of the more controversial theories has been the
   `stasipatric speciation' model, proposed by the pioneering and
   influential cytogeneticist Michael White and his co-workers (White 1968;
   White et al. 1967). This is one of a number of speciation models whereby
   chromosomal rearrangements drive the speciation process. The inspiration
   for the theory of stasipatric speciation came from White's karyotypic
   analyses of a group of Australian grasshoppers of the genus
   Vandiemenella (White et al. 1967) (Fig. 1). It has been exactly three

Abstract = {{Hybridization and whole-genome duplication are both potential mechanisms
   of rapid speciation which sometimes act in concert. Recent surveys,
   showing that homoploid hybrid species tend to be derived from parents
   that are less evolutionarily divergent than parents of polyploid hybrid
   species (allopolyploids), have been interpreted as supporting a
   hypothesis that high divergence between hybridizing species drives
   whole-genome duplication. Here, we argue that such conclusions stem from
   problems in sampling (especially the omission of autopolyploids) and
   null model selection, and underestimate the importance of selection. The
   data simply demonstrate that hybridization between divergent parents has
   a higher probability of successfully producing a species if followed by
   polyploidization.}},

   new competitive microsatellite polymerase chain reaction technique to
   determine the contribution of males to stored sperm and subsequent

   much sperm from a particular male is stored, and unrelated males
   contribute more sperm to storage and have a corresponding higher

Abstract = {{Since European colonization, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus
   leadbeateri) has declined across its range to the point where it is now
   only patchily distributed within the montane ash forests of the Central
   Highlands of Victoria. The loss of large hollow-bearing trees coupled
   with inadequate recruitment of mature ash forest has been predicted to
   result in a reduction in population size of up to 90\% by 2020.
   Furthermore, bioclimatic analyses have suggested additional reductions
   in the species' distribution under a variety of climate change
   scenarios. Using a panel of 15 highly resolving microsatellite markers
   and mitochondrial control region sequence data, we infer past and
   present gene flow. Populations in the northern part of the core range
   were highly admixed, and showed no signs of either current or historical
   barriers to gene flow. A marginal, isolated and inbred population at
   Yellingbo was highly genetically differentiated, both in terms of
   current and historic genetic structure. Sequence data confirmed the
   conclusions from earlier genetic simulation studies that the Yellingbo
   population has been isolated from the rest of the species range since
   before European-induced changes to the montane landscape, and formed
   part of a larger genetic unit that is now otherwise extinct. Historic
   loss of maternal lineages in the Central Highlands of Victoria was
   detected despite signals of immigration, indicating population declines
   that most probably coincided with changes in climate at the end of the
   Pleistocene. Given ongoing habitat loss and the recent (February 2009)
   wildfire in the Central Highlands, we forecast (potentially extensive)
   demographic declines, in line with predicted range reductions under
   climate change scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Large vagile mammals typically exhibit little genetic structuring across
   their range, particularly when their habitat is essentially continuous.
   We investigated the population genetic structure of a large vagile
   Australian macropodid, Macropus fuliginosus, which is continuously
   distributed across most of southern Australia, using nine highly
   polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci. Five distinct genetic units
   were identified across the range, four on the mainland and one on
   Kangaroo Island. In addition to the predicted historic Nullarbor Plain
   Barrier, two unexpected mainland barriers to gene flow were identified.
   Both were associated with landscape discontinuities (Swan River,
   Flinders Ranges), which appear within the dispersal capabilities of M.
   fuliginosus. Typical of large vagile mammals, M. fuliginosus displays
   high genetic diversity (with the exception of an insular population) and
   weak genetic structuring (within genetic units). However, the expansion
   of M. fuliginosus from southwestern Australia during the Pleistocene has
   resulted in significantly reduced genetic diversity in eastern
   populations. No significant sex-biased dispersal was detected, although
   differences in habitat, densities and climatic conditions between the
   eastern and western regions of the range appear to influence dispersal
   with the effects of isolation by distance only evident in the west.
   These results suggest that the biogeography of southern Australia is
   more complex than previously thought and reveal that seemingly minor
   landscape features can significantly impact genetic structuring in large
   vagile mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the widely recognized incidence of homoplasy characterizing this
   region, the hypervariable region I (HVRI) of the mitochondrial control
   region is one of the most frequently used genetic markers for population
   genetic and phylogeographic studies. We present an evolutionary analysis
   of HVRI and cytochrome b sequences from a range-wide survey of 1031
   Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus, to quantify homoplasy and
   substitution rate at HVRI. Variation in HVRI was distributed across 41
   variable sites in the 238-bp segment examined. All variants at HVR1 were
   found to be transitions. However, our analyses suggest that a minimum of
   101 changes have actually occurred within HVRI with as many as 18
   substitutions occurring at a single site. By including this hidden
   variation into our analyses, several instances of apparent long-range
   dispersal were resolved to be homoplasies and 8.5-12\% of observed HVRI
   haplotypes were found to have geographic distributions descriptive of
   convergent molecular evolution rather than identity by descent. We
   estimate the rate of substitution at HVRI in Steller sea lions to be
   similar to 24 times that of cytochrome b with an absolute rate of HVRI
   substitution estimated at 27.45\% per million years. These findings have
   direct implications regarding the utility of HVRI data to generate a
   variety of evolutionary genetic hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{In times of rapid global and unforeseeable environmental changes, there
   is an urgent need for a sustainable cattle breeding policy, based on a
   global view. Most of the indigenous breeds are specialized in a
   particular habitat or production system but are rapidly disappearing.
   Thus, they represent an important resource to meet present and future
   breeding objectives. Based on 105 microsatellites, we obtained thorough
   information on genetic diversity and population structure of 16 cattle
   breeds that cover a geographical area from the domestication centre near
   Anatolia, through the Balkan and alpine regions, to the North-West of
   Europe. Breeds under strict artificial selection and indigenous breeds
   under traditional breeding schemes were included. The overall results
   showed that the genetic diversity is widespread in Busa breeds in the
   Anatolian and Balkan areas, when compared with the alpine and
   north-western European breeds. Our results reflect long-term
   evolutionary and short-term breeding events very well. The regular
   pattern of allele frequency distribution in the entire cattle population
   studied clearly suggests conservation of rare alleles by conservation of
   preferably unselected traditional breeds with large effective population
   sizes. From a global and long-term conservation genetics point of view,
   the native and highly variable breeds closer to the domestication centre
   could serve as valuable sources of genes for future needs, not only for
   cattle but also for other farm animals.}},

Abstract = {{Population genetic relationships reveal the signatures of current
   processes such as reproductive behaviour and migration, as well as
   historic events including vicariance and climate change. We analyse
   population structure of native walleye Sander vitreus across North
   America, encompassing 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, 26 spawning
   sites and 921 samples from watersheds across the Great Lakes, Lake
   Winnipeg, upper Mississippi River, Ohio River and Mobile Bay of the Gulf
   Coast. Geographical patterning is assessed using phylogenetic trees,
   pairwise F(ST) analogues, hierarchical partitioning, Mantel regression,
   Bayesian assignment and Monmonier geographical networks. Results reveal
   congruent divergences among population groups, corresponding to historic
   isolation in glacial refugia, dispersal patterns and basin divisions.
   Broad-scale relationships show genetic isolation with geographical
   distance, but reproductive groups within basins do not - with some
   having pronounced differences. Greatest divergence distinguishes
   outlying Gulf Coastal and northwest populations, the latter tracing to
   dispersal from the Missourian refugium to former glacial Lake Agassiz,
   and basin isolation similar to 7000 ya. Genetic barriers in the Great
   Lakes separate groups in Lakes Superior, Huron's Georgian Bay, Erie and
   Ontario, reflecting contributions from Mississippian and Atlantic
   refugia, and changes in connectivity patterns. Walleye genetic patterns
   thus reflect vicariance among watersheds and glacial refugia, followed
   by re-colonization pathways and changing drainage connections that
   established modern-day northern populations, whose separations are
   maintained through spawning site fidelity. Conservation management
   practices should preserve genetic identity and unique characters among
   these divergent walleye populations.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Karyotypic differences have been used for delimiting populations or
   species, although whether these mutations provide strong barriers to
   gene flow between populations and promote speciation remains
   contentious. In this study, we assessed whether 11 chromosomal races of
   Australian morabine grasshoppers (Vandiemenella viatica species group)
   represent genetically distinct populations by analyses of cytological
   and allozyme (35 loci) data and DNA sequences of the elongation factor-1
   alpha (EF-1 alpha), anonymous Mvia11, and mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) loci. While the Vandiemenella chromosomal taxa
   generally represent genetically distinct units, a substantial portion of
   the total genetic variation in our samples was not explained by the
   chromosomal variation. Mantel tests indicated that Vandiemenella
   populations were spatially structured and have maintained gene flow at a
   local scale within each of the taxa. The group was subdivided into 13
   genetic clusters; four chromosomal taxa comprised single exclusive
   clusters, while others comprised more than one cluster or clusters
   shared with other taxa. Boundaries of these cryptic population
   subdivisions correspond with several biogeographical barriers, such as
   straits, gulfs, the Murray River, and an ancient mega-lake, Lake
   Bungunnia. The viatica species group was previously proposed to have
   diversified without major geographical separation based on the
   stasipatric speciation model; however, the present study suggests the
   involvement of allopatric fragmentation. Given extensive nonmonophyly of
   chromosomal taxa and incomplete barriers to gene flow among taxa, all
   Vandiemenella chromosomal taxa and genetically distinct populations
   within chromosomal taxa, except Vandiemenella pichirichi, should be
   regarded as populations of one species: Vandiemenella viatica.}},

Title = {{Lineage diversification in a widespread species: roles for niche

Abstract = {{Niche conservatism and niche divergence are both important ecological
   mechanisms associated with promoting allopatric speciation across
   geographical barriers. However, the potential for variable responses in
   widely distributed organisms has not been fully investigated. For
   allopatric sister lineages, three patterns for the interaction of
   ecological niche preference and geographical barriers are possible: (i)
   niche conservatism at a physical barrier; (ii) niche divergence at a
   physical barrier; and (iii) niche divergence in the absence of a
   physical barrier. We test for the presence of these patterns in a
   transcontinentally distributed snake species, the common kingsnake
   (Lampropeltis getula), to determine the relative frequency of niche
   conservatism or divergence in a single species complex inhabiting
   multiple distinct ecoregions. We infer the phylogeographic structure of
   the kingsnake using a range-wide data set sampled for the mitochondrial
   gene cytochrome b. We use coalescent simulation methods to test for the
   presence of structured lineage formation vs. fragmentation of a
   widespread ancestor. Finally, we use statistical techniques for creating
   and evaluating ecological niche models to test for conservatism of
   ecological niche preferences. Significant geographical structure is
   present in the kingsnake, for which coalescent tests indicate structured
   population division. Surprisingly, we find evidence for all three
   patterns of conservatism and divergence. This suggests that ecological
   niche preferences may be labile on recent phylogenetic timescales, and
   that lineage formation in widespread species can result from an
   interaction between inertial tendencies of niche conservatism and
   natural selection on populations in ecologically divergent habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions usually start with a small number of founder
   individuals. These founders are likely to represent a small fraction of
   the total genetic diversity found in the source population. Our study
   set out to trace genetically the geographical origin of the
   horse-chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, an invasive
   microlepidopteran whose area of origin is still unkown. Since its
   discovery in Macedonia 25 years ago, this insect has experienced an
   explosive westward range expansion, progressively colonizing all of
   Central and Western Europe. We used cytochrome oxidase I sequences (DNA
   barcode fragment) and a set of six polymorphic microsatellites to assess
   the genetic variability of C. ohridella populations, and to test the
   hypothesis that C. ohridella derives from the southern Balkans (Albania,
   Macedonia and Greece). Analysis of mtDNA of 486 individuals from 88
   localities allowed us to identify 25 geographically structured
   haplotypes. In addition, 480 individuals from 16 populations from Europe
   and the southern Balkans were genotyped for 6 polymorphic microsatellite
   loci. High haplotype diversity and low measures of nucleotide
   diversities including a significantly negative Tajima's D indicate that
   C. ohridella has experienced rapid population expansion during its
   dispersal across Europe. Both mtDNA and microsatellites show a reduction
   in genetic diversity of C. ohridella populations sampled from artificial
   habitats (e.g. planted trees in public parks, gardens, along roads in
   urban or sub-urban areas) across Europe compared with C. ohridella
   sampled in natural stands of horse-chestnuts in the southern Balkans.
   These findings suggest that European populations of C. ohridella may
   indeed derive from the southern Balkans.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of alpine glaciers during the Pleistocene had profound effects on
   montane landscapes in North America and the organisms now inhabiting
   alpine ecosystems. Biogeography of this region has often been viewed as
   a system of sky islands despite the fact that species richness patterns
   deviate from a strict island biogeographic model. One explanation is
   that alpine species are not in equilibrium because of late Quaternary
   geographic range shifts. Genetic data can provide evidence of
   nonequilibrium dynamics and the distributional shifts that occur during
   glaciation events in alpine landscapes. Using mitochondrial and nuclear
   sequence data, we examine the evolutionary history of butterflies in the
   Parnassius phoebus complex. We test explicit, alternative models of the
   biogeographic history of Parnassius smintheus and Parnassius behrii,
   including an equilibrium island model, ancestral radiation and
   fragmentation, an expanding alpine archipelago and an alpine archipelago
   refuge model. Our results support the alpine archipelago refuge model,
   in which alpine butterflies undergo population contraction during
   glacial climates followed by population expansion during interglacial
   phases. While butterflies can disperse between distant mountain ranges
   during glacial periods, gene flow is rare. We find evidence of recent
   connectivity between California and Colorado, population expansion
   events following deglaciation similar to 20 000 years B.P., and small
   population sizes during the last glacial period. An analysis of lineage
   splitting suggests that morphological differences in P. smintheus and P.
   behrii are the result of late Pleistocene divergence (similar to 48 000
   years B.P.) with limited gene flow. Our results demonstrate that
   spatially complex and nonequilibrium population dynamics influence
   alpine diversity patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of a group or population of organisms can
   profoundly influence the potential for inbreeding and, through this, can
   affect both dispersal strategies and mating systems. We used estimates
   of genetic relatedness as well as likelihood-based methods to
   reconstruct social group composition and examine sex biases in dispersal
   in a Costa Rican population of white-throated magpie-jays (Calocitta
   formosa, Swainson 1827), one of the few birds suggested to have
   female-biased natal philopatry. We found that females within groups were
   more closely related than males, which is consistent with observational
   data indicating that males disperse upon maturity, whereas females tend
   to remain in their natal territories and act as helpers. In addition,
   males were generally unrelated to one another within groups, suggesting
   that males do not disperse with or towards relatives. Finally, within
   social groups, female helpers were less related to male than female
   breeders, suggesting greater male turnover within groups. This last
   result indicates that within the natal group, female offspring have more
   opportunities than males to mate with nonrelatives, which might help to
   explain the unusual pattern of female-biased philopatry and male-biased
   dispersal in this system. We suggest that the novel approach adopted
   here is likely to be particularly useful for short-term studies or those
   conducted on rare or difficult-to-observe species, as it allows one to
   establish general patterns of philopatry and genetic structure without
   the need for long-term monitoring of identifiable individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Although many sharks begin their life confined in nursery habitats, it
   is unknown how rapidly they disperse away from their natal area once
   they leave the nursery. We examine this issue in immature lemon sharks
   (Negaprion brevirostris) from the time they leave the nursery (similar
   to age 3) at a subtropical island (Bimini, Bahamas), through to the
   onset of sexual maturity (similar to age 12). From 1995 to 2007 we
   tagged and genotyped a large fraction of the nursery-bound sharks at
   this location (0-3 years of age, N = 1776 individuals). From 2003 to
   2007 we sampled immature sharks aged from 3 to 11 years (N = 150) living
   around the island and used physical/genetic tag recaptures coupled with
   kinship analysis to determine whether or not each of these `large
   immature sharks' was locally born. We show that many island-born lemon
   sharks remain close to their natal area for long periods (years) after
   leaving the nursery; more than half of the sampled sharks up to 135 cm
   total length (similar to 6 years old) were locally born. The fraction of
   locally born sharks gradually declined with increasing shark size,
   indicating that dispersal is relatively slow and does not primarily
   occur after sharks reach a threshold size. Local conservation measures
   (e.g. localized fishery closures, marine protected areas) can therefore
   help protect island-born lemon sharks even after they leave the nursery
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific variability in mating behaviour and disparities between
   social and reproductive behaviour add complexity to the description of
   animal mating systems. A previously published field study on a
   population of the maternally mouthbrooding cichlid fish Ctenochromis
   horei in the north of Lake Tanganyika suggested mate monopolization by
   the most dominant male. In the present study, genetic reconstructions of
   paternity in a population in the south of the lake provided no evidence
   for male mate monopolization, as none of the inferred sires had
   offspring in more than one brood. The ability to reconstruct sire
   genotypes from offspring alleles was confirmed by computer simulations.
   Multiple paternity occurred in several broods and was significantly more
   frequent in the sample taken in the rainy season than in the dry season
   sample (100\% of broods vs. 14\%, respectively; P = 0.005). The data
   suggest geographical and temporal variation in the mating behaviour of
   C. horei despite its continuous year-round reproduction, invariable
   brood care behaviour and habitat-specific distribution in the relatively
   constant and confined environment of a tropical lake. Moreover, our data
   show that inferences on the distribution of male reproductive success,
   if based on each geographical or temporal data set alone, would fail to
   describe the potential for sexual selection in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of reef-building corals acquire their obligate algal
   symbionts (Symbiodinium) from the environment. However, factors shaping
   the initial establishment of coral-algal symbioses, including parental
   effects, local environmental conditions and local availability of
   symbionts, are not well understood. This study monitored the uptake and
   maintenance of Symbiodinium in juveniles of two common corals, Acropora
   tenuis and Acropora millepora, that were reciprocally explanted between
   sites where adult colonies host different types of Symbiodinium. We
   found that coral juveniles were rapidly dominated by type D
   Symbiodinium, even though this type is not found in adult colonies
   (including the parental colonies) in four out of the five study
   populations. Furthermore, type D Symbiodinium was found in less than
   one-third of a wide range of coral species (n > 50) sampled at the two
   main study sites, suggesting that its dominance in the acroporid
   juveniles is not because it is the most abundant local endosymbiotic
   type. Moreover, dominance by type D was observed irrespective of the
   light intensity to which juveniles were exposed in a field study. In
   summary, despite its relatively low abundance in coral assemblages at
   the study sites and irrespective of the surrounding light environment,
   type D Symbiodinium is the main symbiont type initially acquired by
   juveniles of A. millepora and A. tenuis. We conclude that during early
   ontogeny in these corals, there are few barriers to the uptake of
   Symbiodinium types which differ from those found in parental colonies,
   resulting in dominance by a highly infectious and potentially
   opportunistic symbiont.}},

Abstract = {{Juveniles of a number of corals with horizontal transmission of
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts naturally acquire and maintain Symbiodinium
   types that differ from those found in adult populations. However, the
   duration of this early period of symbiont flexibility and successional
   changes leading to dominance by the characteristic adult (homologous)
   type are unknown. To document natural succession of Symbiodinium types
   within juvenile corals, we monitored Symbiodinium communities in
   juveniles of Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora for 3.5 years.
   Juveniles originating from one of three reef populations, characterized
   by differing adult coral-Symbiodinium associations, were raised in a
   common environment. In four out of five cases, juveniles became
   dominated initially by a nonhomologous adult type. Changes in
   Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles led to the
   establishment of the adult homologous association at similar to 3.5
   years of age. These changes were not linked to the onset of reproductive
   maturity, but may be linked to micro-environmental changes associated
   with vertical growth of juvenile corals. We hypothesize that fine-tuning
   of specificity mechanisms takes place during ontogeny in A. tenuis,
   leading to the eventual establishment of the adult homologous
   association. However, Symbiodinium communities in A. millepora juveniles
   did not change significantly over the 3.5 years, potentially reflecting
   (i) lack of specificity, (ii) more than a 3.5-year delay in the onset of
   specificity, or (iii) lack of availability of the adult Symbiodinium
   type. This study demonstrates that juvenile corals may survive for
   extended periods of time with nonhomologous Symbiodinium types and that
   closely related species of Acropora differ in the timing of the onset of
   specificity for algal symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFC) may result from a genome-wide
   process - inbreeding - or local effects within the genome. The majority
   of empirical studies reporting HFCs have attributed correlations to
   inbreeding depression. However, HFCs are unlikely to be caused by
   inbreeding depression because heterozygosity measured at a small number
   of neutral markers is unlikely to accurately capture a genome-wide
   pattern. Testing the strengths of localized effects caused by
   associative overdominance has proven challenging. In their current
   paper, Amos and Acevedo-Whitehouse present a novel test for local HFCs.
   Using stochastic simulations, they determine the conditions under which
   single-locus HFCs arise, before testing the strength of the correlation
   between the neutral marker and a linked gene under selection in their
   simulations. They used insights gained from simulation to statistically
   investigate the likely cause of correlations between heterozygosity and
   disease status using data on bovine tuberculosis infections in a wild
   boar population. They discover that a single microsatellite marker is an
   excellent predictor of tuberculosis progression in infected individuals.
   The results are relevant for wild boar management but, more generally,
   they demonstrate how single-locus HFCs could be used to identify coding
   loci under selection in free-living populations.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing selection is one mechanism that may explain why diversity is
   maintained in wild populations. However, relatively few examples of
   genes showing evidence of balancing selection have been identified,
   particularly in plants. In this issue, Reininga et al. (2009) present
   three Arabidopsis loci that show strong evidence of balancing selection.
   The loci, discovered using a genome-scanning approach, encode proteins
   with diverse predicted functions: starch synthesis and control of gene
   expression. These three genes were identified by scanning only a small
   fraction of the Arabidopsis genome, suggesting that balancing selection
   may be more prevalent than previously known.}},

Abstract = {{The ease of obtaining genotypic data from wild populations has renewed
   interest in the relationship between individual genetic diversity and
   fitness-related traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations, or HFC).
   Here we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of HFC studies using
   powerful multivariate techniques which account for nonindependence of
   data. We compare these findings with those from univariate techniques,
   and test the influence of a range of factors hypothesized to influence
   the strength of HFCs. We found small but significantly positive effect
   sizes for life-history, morphological, and physiological traits; while
   theory predicts higher mean effect sizes for life-history traits, effect
   size did not differ consistently with trait type. Newly proposed
   measures of variation were no more powerful at detecting relationships
   than multilocus heterozygosity, and populations predicted to have
   elevated inbreeding variance did not exhibit higher mean effect sizes.
   Finally, we found evidence for publication bias, with studies reporting
   weak, nonsignificant effects being under-represented in the literature.
   In general, our review shows that HFC studies do not generally reveal
   patterns predicted by population genetic theory, and are of small effect
   (less than 1\% of the variance in phenotypic characters explained).
   Future studies should use more genetic marker data and utilize sampling
   designs that shed more light on the biological mechanisms that may
   modulate the strength of association, for example by contrasting the
   strength of HFCs in mainland and island populations of the same species,
   investigating the role of environmental stress, or by considering how
   selection has shaped the traits under investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow
   among local populations, and has implications for the spread of
   infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats
   (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but
   surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled
   individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to
   characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas
   within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based
   on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the
   inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent
   sites. Most individuals (similar to 95\%) were assigned to their area of
   capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal
   distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats
   were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit
   infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual
   movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are
   comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between
   identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular
   gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation.
   Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history
   characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects
   of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of
   connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides
   information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may
   spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area
   without reinvasion.}},

   advantage in clinical environments}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The genetic structure of a global sample of 170 clinical and nonclinical
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates was analysed using 12 microsatellite
   markers. High levels of genetic diversity were revealed both among the
   clinical and among the nonclinical S. cerevisiae isolates without
   significant differentiation between these two groups of isolates,
   rendering a single origin of pathogenic isolates unlikely. This suggests
   that S. cerevisiae is a true opportunistic pathogen, with a diversity of
   unrelated genetic backgrounds able to cause infections in humans, and
   that the ability of S. cerevisiae isolates to cause infections is likely
   due to a combination of their phenotypic plasticity and the immune
   system status of the exposed individuals. As was previously reported for
   bread, beer and wine strains and for environmental S. cerevisiae
   isolates, the microsatellite genotypes indicated ploidy level variation,
   from possibly haploid up to tetraploid, among clinical S. cerevisiae
   isolates. However, rather than haploid, sporulation proficiency and
   spore viability data indicated that most S. cerevisiae isolates that
   were mono-allelic at all examined microsatellite loci were likely
   homothallic and self-diploidized. Interestingly, the proportion of
   heterozygous clinical isolates was found to be significantly higher than
   the proportion of heterozygous nonclinical isolates, suggesting a
   selective advantage of heterozygous S. cerevisiae yeasts in clinical
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The West African trypanosomoses are mostly transmitted by riverine
   species of tsetse fly. In this study, we estimate the dispersal and
   population size of tsetse populations located along the Mouhoun river in
   Burkina Faso where tsetse habitats are experiencing increasing
   fragmentation caused by human encroachment. Dispersal estimated through
   direct (mark and recapture) and indirect (genetic isolation by distance)
   methods appeared consistent with one another. In these fragmented
   landscapes, tsetse flies displayed localized, small subpopulations with
   relatively short effective dispersal. We discuss how such information is
   crucial for designing optimal strategies for eliminating this threat. To
   estimate ecological parameters of wild animal populations, the genetic
   measures are both a cost- and time-effective alternative to
   mark-release-recapture. They can be applied to other vector-borne
   diseases of medical and/or economic importance.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2798-2811}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is commonly found that effective population sizes of natural
   populations are much smaller than census sizes of plants and animals.
   However, theoretical studies have shown that factors rarely investigated
   empirically, like seed banks in plants and diapause in animals, may have
   profound influence on effective sizes. Here we investigate whether the
   presence of seed banks can explain the relatively high genetic
   variability observed in northern European Arabidopsis thaliana
   populations with small census sizes. We have genotyped three above- and
   below- ground cohorts in 27 Norwegian populations using single
   nucleotide polymorphism markers. Although the populations varied
   extensively in levels of variability within and between cohorts,
   standard genetic population measures were comparable to those obtained
   in previous studies on above-ground cohorts using microsatellite
   markers. Estimated effective population sizes are larger for total
   populations (containing both seed bank and above-ground cohorts for 1
   year) compared to each of the cohorts considered separately. Using a
   conservative approach, we find that the effective sizes are larger than
   census sizes of local populations, and that the effective generation
   time is higher than 1 year (3-4 years, on average), making A. thaliana a
   perennial semelparous plant at many northern European localities.}},

   samples to analyse population constraints in evolutionary time. We
   tested colony structure and population history of the social S.
   mimosarum from South and East Africa using mitochondrial DNA variation,
   and we compared the results to published data for the independently
   evolved social congener S. dumicola. S. mimosarum had many and diverse
   haplotypes (5-7\% sequence divergence for ND1) but colonies were
   monomorphic and genealogically similar haplotypes occurred in abutting
   regions. These findings are nearly identical to results for S. dumicola
   and imply similar colony-level processes over evolutionary time in
   independently evolved social species. These population dynamics are
   discussed with respect to the apparent lack of cladogenesis in social
   spiders.}},

Abstract = {{The giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) has successfully invaded 19
   European countries as well as parts of North America. It has become a
   problematic species due to its ability to displace native flora and to
   cause public health hazards. Applying population genetics to species
   invasion can help reconstruct invasion history and may promote more
   efficient management practice. We thus analysed levels of genetic
   variation and population genetic structure of H. mantegazzianum in an
   invaded area of the western Swiss Alps as well as in its native range
   (the Caucasus), using eight nuclear microsatellite loci together with
   plastid DNA markers and sequences. On both nuclear and plastid genomes,
   native populations exhibited significantly higher levels of genetic
   diversity compared to invasive populations, confirming an important
   founder event during the invasion process. Invasive populations were
   also significantly more differentiated than native populations. Bayesian
   clustering analysis identified five clusters in the native range that
   corresponded to geographically and ecologically separated groups. In the
   invaded range, 10 clusters occurred. Unlike native populations, invasive
   clusters were characterized by a mosaic pattern in the landscape,
   possibly caused by anthropogenic dispersal of the species via roads and
   direct collection for ornamental purposes. Lastly, our analyses revealed
   four main divergent groups in the western Swiss Alps, likely as a
   consequence of multiple independent establishments of H. mantegazzianum.}},

Abstract = {{What is the relationship between genetic or environmental variation and
   the variation in messenger RNA (mRNA) expression? To address this,
   microarrays were used to examine the effect of genetic and environmental
   variation on cardiac mRNA expression for metabolic genes in three groups
   of Fundulus heteroclitus: (i) individuals sampled in the field (field),
   (ii) field individuals acclimated for 6 months to laboratory conditions
   (acclimated), or (iii) individuals bred for 10 successive generations in
   a laboratory environment (G10). The G10 individuals have significantly
   less genetic variation than individuals obtained in the field and had a
   significantly lower variation in mRNA expression across all genes in
   comparison to the other two groups (P = 0.001). When examining the gene
   specific variation, 22 genes had variation in expression that was
   significantly different among groups with lower variation in G10
   individuals than in acclimated individuals. Additionally, there were
   fewer genes with significant differences in expression among G10
   individuals vs. either acclimated or field individuals: 66 genes have
   statistically different levels of expression vs. 107 or 97 for
   acclimated or field groups. Based on the permutation of the data, these
   differences in the number of genes with significant differences among
   individuals within a group are unlikely to occur by chance (P < 0.01).
   Surprisingly, variation in mRNA expression in field individuals is lower
   than in acclimated individuals. Relative to the variation among
   individual within a group, few genes have significant differences in
   expression among groups (seven, 2.3\%) and none of these are different
   between acclimated and field individuals. The results support the
   concept that genetic variation affects variation in mRNA expression and
   also suggests that temporal environmental variation associated with
   estuarine environments does not increase the variation among individuals
   or add to the differences among groups.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular population genetic analysis of three chromosomal regions in
   Arabidopsis thaliana suggested that balancing selection might operate to
   maintain variation at three novel candidate adaptive trait genes,
   including SOLUBLE STARCH SYNTHASE I (SSI), PLASTID TRANSCRIPTIONALLY
   ACTIVE 7(PTAC7), and BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BLH10). If balanced
   polymorphisms are indeed maintained at these loci, then we would expect
   to observe functional variation underlying the previously detected
   signatures of selection. We observe multiple replacement polymorphisms
   within and in the 32 amino acids just upstream of the protein-protein
   interacting BELL domain at the BLH10 locus. While no clear protein
   sequence differences are found between allele types in SSI and PTAC7,
   these two genes show evidence for allele-specific variation in
   expression levels. Geographical patterns of allelic differentiation seem
   consistent with population stratification in this species and a
   significant longitudinal cline was observed at all three candidate loci.
   These data support a hypothesis of balancing selection at all three
   candidate loci and provide a basis for more detailed functional work by
   identifying possible functional differences that might be selectively
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Historical mitochondrial introgression causes differences between a
   species' mitochondrial gene genealogy and its nuclear gene genealogy,
   making tree-based species delineation ambiguous. Using sequence data
   from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and three nuclear genes
   (introns), we examined the evolutionary history of four high elevation
   Tibetan megophryid frog species, Scutiger boulengeri, Scutiger
   glandulatus, Scutiger mammatus and Scutiger tuberculatus. The three
   nuclear genes shared a similar history but the mitochondrial gene tree
   suggested a drastically different evolutionary scenario. The conflicts
   between them were explained by multiple episodes of mitochondrial
   introgression events via historical interspecific hybridization.
   `Foreign' mitochondrial genomes might have been fixed in populations and
   extended through a large portion of the species' distribution. Some
   hybridization events were probably as old as 10 Myr, while others were
   recent. An F(1) hybrid was also identified. Historical hybridization
   events among the four species appeared to be persistent and were not
   restricted to the period of Pleistocene glaciation, as in several other
   well-studied cases. Furthermore, hybridization involved several species
   and occurred in multiple directions, and there was no indication of one
   mitochondrial genome being superior to others. In addition, incomplete
   lineage sorting resulting from budding speciation may have also
   explained some discrepancies between the mitochondrial DNA and nuclear
   gene trees. Combining all evidences, the former `Scutiger mammatus'
   appeared to be two species, including a new species. With the
   availability of a wide range of highly variable nuclear gene markers, we
   recommend using a combination of mitochondrial gene and multiple nuclear
   genes to reveal a complete species history.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic oscillations throughout the Pleistocene combined with
   geological and topographic complexity resulted in extreme habitat
   heterogeneity along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. Inferring how these
   historic landscape patterns have structured the current diversity of the
   region's biota is important both for our understanding of the factors
   promoting diversification, as well as the conservation of this
   biodiversity hotspot. Here we evaluate potential historical scenarios of
   diversification in the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil by
   investigating the population genetic structure of a frog endemic to the
   region. Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, we generated a
   Bayesian population-level phylogeny of the Thoropa miliaris species
   complex. We found deep genetic divergences among five geographically
   distinct clades. Southern clades were monophyletic and nested within
   paraphyletic northern clades. Analyses of historical demographic
   patterns suggest an overall north to south population expansion, likely
   associated with regional differences in habitat stability during the
   Pliocene and early Pleistocene. However, genetic structure among
   southern populations is less pronounced and likely represents more
   recent vicariant events resulting from Holocenic sea-level oscillations.
   Our analyses corroborate that the Atlantic Coastal Forest has been a
   biogeographically dynamic landscape and suggest that the high diversity
   of its fauna and flora resulted from a combination of climatic and
   geologic events from the Pliocene to the present.}},

Abstract = {{The Guianas have often been proposed as a forest refugium; however, this
   view has received little testing. Studies of population genetics of
   forest taxa suggest that the central part of French Guiana remained
   forested, while the southern part (currently forested) may have
   harboured more open vegetation. Insights into the population structure
   of species restricted to non-forested habitats can help test this
   hypothesis. Using six microsatellite loci, we investigated the
   population genetics of French Guianan accessions of Manihot esculenta
   ssp. flabellifolia, a taxon restricted to coastal savannas and to rocky
   outcrops in the densely forested inland. Coastal populations were highly
   differentiated from one another, and our data suggest a recent
   colonization of these savannas by M. esculenta ssp. flabellifolia in a
   west-to-east process. Coastal populations were strongly differentiated
   from inselberg populations, consistent with an ancient separation of
   these two groups, with no or low subsequent gene flow. This supports the
   hypothesis that the central part of the region may have remained
   forested since the Last Glacial Maximum, impeding the establishment of
   Manihot. Contrary to coastal populations, inselberg Manihot populations
   were strikingly homogeneous at a broad spatial scale. This suggests they
   were connected until recently, either by a large continuous savanna area
   or by smaller, temporary disturbed areas shifting in space.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms must make important decisions on how to allocate resources to
   reproduction. We investigated allocation decisions in the social wasp
   Vespula maculifrons to understand how social insects make reproductive
   choices. We first determined how annual colonies apportioned resources
   to growth and reproduction by analysing developing brood. In contrast to
   expectations, colonies invested in both growth (workers) and
   reproduction (males) simultaneously. In addition, colonies showed
   evidence of producing males in pulses and reversing their reproductive
   choices by decreasing investment in males late in the season. This
   reversal is consistent with theory suggesting that colonies decrease
   production in males if fitness of late emerging males is low. To further
   investigate reproductive decisions within colonies, we determined if the
   male mates of multiply-mated queens varied in their reproductive success
   over time. Sperm use by queens did vary over time suggesting that male
   success may depend on sperm clumping within the female reproductive
   tract. Finally, we tested if colony sex ratio conformed to expectations
   under kin selection theory that nestmate relatedness would positively
   correlate with investment in new queens if workers controlled sex
   allocation. Surprisingly, the proportion of queens produced by colonies
   was negatively correlated with nestmate relatedness, suggesting that
   allocation may be shaped by advantages arising from increased genetic
   diversity resulting from multiple mating by queens. Overall, our study
   suggests that the reproductive decisions of colonies are flexible and
   may depend both on environmental cues arising from energetic needs of
   the colony and genetic cues arising from mating behaviours of queens.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since Ernst Mayr (1942) called ring species the `perfect
   demonstration of speciation', they have attracted much interest from
   researchers examining how two species evolve from one. In a ring
   species, two sympatric and reproductively isolated forms are connected
   by a long chain of intermediate populations that encircle a geographic
   barrier. Ring species have the potential to demonstrate that speciation
   can occur without complete geographic isolation, in contrast to the
   classic model of allopatric speciation. They also allow researchers to
   examine the causes of reproductive isolation in the contact zone and to
   use spatial variation to infer the steps by which speciation occurs.
   According to the classical definition, a ring species must have (i)
   gradual variation through a chain of populations connecting two
   divergent and sympatric forms, and (ii) complete or nearly complete
   reproductive isolation between the terminal forms. But evolutionary
   biologists now recognize that the process of speciation might often
   occur with some periods of geographic contact and hybridization between
   diverging forms; during these phases, even partial reproductive
   isolation can limit gene flow and permit further divergence to occur. In
   this issue Bensch et al. (2009) make an exciting and important
   contribution by extending the ring species concept to a case in which
   the divergence is much younger and not yet advanced to full reproductive
   isolation. Their study of geographic variation in willow warblers
   (Phylloscopus trochilus; Fig. 1) provides a beautiful example of gradual
   variation through a ring of populations connecting two forms that are
   partially reproductively isolated where they meet, possibly due to
   divergent migratory behaviours of the terminal forms.}},

Abstract = {{Much of Earth's biodiversity has arisen through adaptive radiation.
   Important avenues of phenotypic divergence during this process include
   the evolution of body size and life history (Schluter 2000). Extensive
   adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes have occurred in the Great Lakes
   of Africa, giving rise to behaviours that are remarkably sophisticated
   and diverse across species. In Tanganyikan shell-brooding cichlids of
   the tribe Lamprologini, tremendous intraspecific variation in body size
   accompanies complex breeding systems and use of empty snail shells to
   hide from predators and rear offspring. A study by Takahashi et al.
   (2009) in this issue of Molecular Ecology reveals the first case of
   genetic divergence between dwarf and normal-sized morphs of the same
   nominal lamprologine species, Telmatochromis temporalis. Patterns of
   population structure suggest that the dwarf, shell-dwelling morph of T.
   temporalis might have arisen from the normal, rock-dwelling morph
   independently in more than one region of the lake, and that pairs of
   morphs at different sites may represent different stages early in the
   process of ecological speciation. The findings of Takahashi et al. are
   important first steps towards understanding the evolution of these
   intriguing morphs, yet many questions remain unanswered about the mating
   system, gene flow, plasticity and selection. Despite these limitations,
   descriptive work like theirs takes on much significance in African
   cichlids due to forthcoming resources for comparative genomics.}},

Abstract = {{Clonal reproduction may facilitate the spread of invasive species by
   reducing the minimum population size necessary for successful
   establishment. We used microsatellite markers to reconstruct the
   composition of founding populations in two regional (Central Africa and
   Hawaii) and 23 local (near a Gabonese oilfield) invasions of the
   facultatively parthenogenetic little fire ant. Central Africa had a
   single dominant queen clone, which appears to have initiated the
   regional infestation, and then produced numerous other clones by rare
   sexual reproduction. This interpretation of the data was also supported
   by the genotype of a worker from the first collection in Africa (Gabon
   1913). We found only a single queen clone in Hawaii, likewise indicating
   a single-clone introduction, most likely from an earlier infestation in
   Florida. Single-clone introductions also gave rise to the vast majority
   (92\%) of local infestations at our oilfield study site. These results
   suggest the unusual, largely clonal, reproductive strategy of the little
   fire ant may enhance its success as an invasive species. However, the
   occasional sexual production of novel genotypes after the initial
   introduction may provide genetic flexibility that overcomes shortcomings
   of pure clonality.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics is an important framework for investigating the
   influence of spatial pattern on ecological process. Nevertheless, the
   standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty
   evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We
   use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative
   contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic
   connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and
   contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in
   naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the
   approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect
   estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx
   temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the
   genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the
   reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified
   landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate
   sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic
   model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative
   hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more
   information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic
   landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in
   dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from
   genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary
   landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated
   gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is
   rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies use genetic markers to explore population structure and
   variability within species. However, only a minority use more than one
   type of marker and, despite increasing evidence of a link between
   heterozygosity and individual fitness, few ask whether diversity
   correlates with population trajectory. To address these issues, we
   analysed data from the Steller's sea lion, Eumetiopias jubatus, where
   three stocks are distributed over a vast geographical range and where
   both genetic samples and detailed demographic data have been collected
   from many diverse breeding colonies. To previously published
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite data sets, we have added
   new data for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers,
   comprising 238 loci scored in 285 sea lions sampled from 23 natal
   rookeries. Genotypic diversity was low relative to most vertebrates,
   with only 37 loci (15.5\%) being polymorphic. Moreover, contrasting
   geographical patterns of genetic diversity were found at the three
   markers, with Nei's gene diversity tending to be higher for AFLPs and
   microsatellites in rookeries of the western and Asian stocks, while the
   highest mtDNA values were found in the eastern stock. Overall, and
   despite strongly contrasting demographic histories, after applying
   phylogenetic correction we found little correlation between genetic
   diversity and either colony size or demography. In contrast, we were
   able to show a highly significant positive relationship between AFLP
   diversity and current population size across a range of pinniped
   species, even though equivalent analyses did not reveal significant
   trends for either microsatellites or mtDNA.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the relative roles of vicariance and selection in
   restricting gene flow between populations is of central importance to
   the evolutionary process of population divergence and speciation. Here
   we use molecular and morphological data to contrast the effect of
   isolation (by mountains and geographical distance) with that of
   ecological factors (altitudinal gradients) in promoting differentiation
   in the wedge-billed woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus, a tropical
   forest bird, in Ecuador. Tarsus length and beak size increased relative
   to body size with altitude on both sides of the Andes, and were
   correlated with the amount of moss on tree trunks, suggesting the role
   of selection in driving adaptive divergence. In contrast, molecular data
   revealed a considerable degree of admixture along these altitudinal
   gradients, suggesting that adaptive divergence in morphological traits
   has occurred in the presence of gene flow. As suggested by mitochondrial
   DNA sequence data, the Andes act as a barrier to gene flow between
   ancient subspecific lineages. Genome-wide amplified fragment length
   polymorphism markers reflected more recent patterns of gene flow and
   revealed fine-scale patterns of population differentiation that were not
   detectable with mitochondrial DNA, including the differentiation of
   isolated coastal populations west of the Andes. Our results support the
   predominant role of geographical isolation in driving genetic
   differentiation in G. spirurus, yet suggest the role of selection in
   driving parallel morphological divergence along ecological gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have found amphibian populations to be
   genetically highly structured over rather short geographical distances,
   and that the rate of genetically effective dispersal may differ between
   the sexes. However, apart from the common frog (Rana temporaria) little
   is known about the genetic structuring and sex-biased dispersal in
   northern European amphibians. We investigated the patterns of genetic
   diversity and differentiation within and among Scandinavian populations
   of the moor frog (Rana arvalis) using microsatellite markers. The
   genetic diversity within local R. arvalis populations was not a simple
   linear negative function of latitude but a convex one: genetic diversity
   peaked in mid-latitude populations, and declined thereafter dramatically
   towards the north. The average degree of genetic differentiation among
   populations (F(ST) = 0.14) was lower than that observed for the common
   frog (F(ST) = 0.21), though the pattern of isolation by distance was
   similar for both species. Contrary to common frogs, no evidence for
   female-biased dispersal was found. The results reinforce the view that
   amphibian populations are-in general-highly structured over relatively
   small geographical distances, even in comparatively recently colonized
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Complex life strategies are common among plant pathogens belonging to
   rust fungi (Uredinales). The heteroecious willow rust Melampsora
   larici-epitea produces five spore stages and alternates on larch
   (Larix). To shed light on the epidemiology of this pathogen, amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to determine the genetic
   diversity and genetic structure of rust samples collected from coppice
   willow (Salix) plantations at three UK sites (LA, CA and MC) over three
   sampling dates (September 2000, July 2001 and September 2001). Of the
   total of 819 isolates, 465 were unique AFLP phenotypes and there was a
   shift in genotype diversity between the two seasons (0.67 in 2000 and
   0.87-0.89 in 2001). No phenotypes were common between the two seasons
   within a site, suggesting that the rust did not overwinter as an asexual
   stage within plantations. A temporal analysis detected large amounts of
   genetic drift (F(S) = 0.15-0.26) between the two seasons and very small
   effective population sizes (N(e) = 2-3) within sites. These results all
   point to a new colonization of the plantations by the rust in the second
   season (2001). The F(ST)-analogue values were Theta(CT) = 0.121, Weir
   and Cockerham's theta = 0.086 and the Bayesian estimate theta(B) =
   0.087-0.096. The results suggest that the sources of inoculum were
   somewhat localized and the same sources were mainly responsible for
   disease epidemics in LA and CA over the two seasons. The relatively low
   F(ST)-values among sites (0.055-0.13) suggest the existence of
   significant gene flow among the three sampled sites.}},

Abstract = {{Study of adaptive evolutionary changes in populations of invasive
   species can be advanced through the joint application of quantitative
   and population genetic methods. Using purple loosestrife as a model
   system, we investigated the relative roles of natural selection, genetic
   drift and gene flow in the invasive process by contrasting phenotypical
   and neutral genetic differentiation among native European and invasive
   North American populations (Q(ST) - F(ST) analysis). Our results
   indicate that invasive and native populations harbour comparable levels
   of amplified fragment length polymorphism variation, a pattern
   consistent with multiple independent introductions from a diverse
   European gene pool. However, it was observed that the genetic variation
   reduced during subsequent invasion, perhaps by founder effects and
   genetic drift. Comparison of genetically based quantitative trait
   differentiation (Q(ST)) with its expectation under neutrality (F(ST))
   revealed no evidence of disruptive selection (Q(ST) > F(ST)) or
   stabilizing selection (Q(ST) < F(ST)). One exception was found for only
   one trait (the number of stems) showing significant sign of stabilizing
   selection across all populations. This suggests that there are
   difficulties in distinguishing the effects of nonadaptive population
   processes and natural selection. Multiple introductions of purple
   loosestrife may have created a genetic mixture from diverse source
   populations and increased population genetic diversity, but its link to
   the adaptive differentiation of invasive North American populations
   needs further research.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variability was studied in the common sea urchin Paracentrotus
   lividus through the analysis of the genetic composition of three yearly
   cohorts sampled over two consecutive springs in a locality in
   northwestern Mediterranean. Individuals were aged using growth ring
   patterns observed in tests and samples were genotyped for five
   microsatellite loci. No reduction of genetic diversity was observed
   relative to a sample of the adult population from the same location or
   within cohorts across years. F-ST and amova results indicated that the
   differentiation between cohorts is rather shallow and not significant,
   as most variability is found within cohorts and within individuals. This
   mild differentiation translated into estimates of effective population
   size of 90-100 individuals. When the observed excess of homozygotes was
   taken into account, the estimate of the average number of breeders
   increased to c. 300 individuals. Given our restricted sampling area and
   the known small-scale heterogeneity in recruitment in this species, our
   results suggest that at stretches of a few kilometres of shoreline,
   large numbers of progenitors are likely to contribute to the larval pool
   at each reproduction event. Intercohort variation in our samples is six
   times smaller than spatial variation between adults of four localities
   in the western Mediterranean. Our results indicate that, notwithstanding
   the stochastic events that take place during the long planktonic phase
   and during the settlement and recruitment processes, reproductive
   success in this species is high enough to produce cohorts genetically
   diverse and with little differentiation between them. Further research
   is needed before the link between genetic structure and underlying
   physical and biological processes can be well established.}},

Abstract = {{In aphids, reproductive mode is generally assumed to be selected for by
   winter climate. Sexual lineages produce frost-resistant eggs, conferring
   an advantage in regions with cold winters, while asexual lineages
   predominate in regions with mild winters. However, habitat and resource
   heterogeneities are known to exert a strong influence on sex maintenance
   and might modulate the effect of climate on aphid reproductive
   strategies. We carried out a hierarchical sampling in northern France to
   investigate whether reproductive mode variation of the aphid
   Rhopalosiphum padi is driven by winter climate conditions, by habitat
   and resource heterogeneities represented by a range of host plants or by
   both factors. We confirmed the coexistence in R. padi populations of two
   genetic clusters associated with distinct reproductive strategies.
   Asexual lineages predominated, whatever the surveyed year and location.
   However, we detected a between-year variation in the local contribution
   of both clusters, presumably associated with preceding winter severity.
   No evidence for host-driven niche differentiation was found in the field
   on six Poaceae among sexual and asexual lineages. Two dominant
   multilocus genotypes (similar to 70\% of the sample), having persisted
   over a 10-year period, were equally abundant on different plant species
   and locations, indicating their large ecological tolerance. Our results
   fit theoretical predictions of the influence of winter climate on the
   balance between sexual and asexual lineages. They also highlight the
   importance of current agricultural practices which seem to favour a
   small number of asexual generalist genotypes and their migration across
   large areas of monotonous environments.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated variation in transcript abundance in the scleractinian
   coral, Acropora millepora, within and between populations
   characteristically exposed to different turbidity regimes and hence
   different levels of light and suspended particulate matter. We examined
   phenotypic plasticity by comparing levels of gene expression between
   source populations and following 10 days of acclimatization to a
   laboratory environment. Analyses of variance revealed that 0.05\% of
   genes were differentially expressed between source populations, 1.32\%
   following translocation into a common laboratory and 0.07\% in the
   interaction (source population-dependent responses to translocation).
   Functional analyses identified an over-representation of differentially
   expressed genes associated with metabolism and fluorescence categories
   (primarily downregulated), and environmental information processing
   (primarily upregulated) following translocation to a lower light and
   turbidity environment. Such metabolic downregulation may indicate
   nonoxidative stress, hibernation or caloric restriction associated with
   the changed environmental conditions. Green fluorescent protein-related
   genes were the most differentially expressed and were exclusively
   downregulated; however, green fluorescent protein levels remained
   unchanged following translocation. Photophysiological responses of
   corals from both locations were characterized by a decline when
   introduced to the common laboratory environment but remained healthy
   (F(v)/F(m) > 0.6). Declines in total lipid content following
   translocation were the greatest for inshore corals, suggesting that
   turbid water corals have a strong reliance on heterotrophic feeding.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence variation at the intron-1 of the voltage-gated sodium channel
   gene in Anopheles gambiae M- and S-forms from Cameroon was assessed to
   explore the number of mutational events originating knockdown resistance
   (kdr) alleles. Mosquitoes were sampled between December 2005 and June
   2006 from three geographical areas: (i) Magba in the western region;
   (ii) Loum, Tiko, Douala, Kribi, and Campo along the Atlantic coast; and
   (iii) Bertoua, in the eastern continental plateau. Both 1014S and 1014F
   kdr alleles were found in the S-form with overall frequencies of 14\%
   and 42\% respectively. Only the 1014F allele was found in the M-form at
   lower frequency (11\%). Analysis of a 455 bp region of intron-1 upstream
   the kdr locus revealed four independent mutation events originating kdr
   alleles, here named MS1 -1014F, S1-1014S and S2-1014S kdr-intron-1
   haplotypes in S-form and MS3-1014F kdr-intron-1 haplotype in the M-form.
   Furthermore, there was evidence for mutual introgression of kdr 1014F
   allele between the two molecular forms, MS1 and MS3 being widely shared
   by them. Although no M/S hybrid was observed in analysed samples, this
   wide distribution of haplotypes MS1 and MS3 suggests inter-form
   hybridizing at significant level and emphasizes the rapid diffusion of
   the kdr alleles in Africa. The mosaic of genetic events found in
   Cameroon is representative of the situation in the West-Central African
   region and highlights the importance of evaluating the spatial and
   temporal evolution of kdr alleles for a better management of insecticide
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The circular distribution of the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus
   around the Baltic Sea shares many features with the classic examples of
   ring species; however, the system is much younger. It has previously
   been shown that a secondary contact zone is located in central
   Scandinavia, where there are narrow clines for several morphological
   traits coincident with a migratory divide. Here we analyse multiple
   traits and genes from > 1700 males captured on breeding territories at
   77 sites spread around the Baltic Sea to test the following hypothesis.
   If the secondary contact zone in Scandinavia is a result of divergence
   in two allopatric refuge populations during the last glaciation, we
   expect to find a similar secondary contact zone somewhere else around
   the circular distribution. Our results show that the trait clines were
   wider and displaced from each other along the eastern side of the Baltic
   Sea. Analyses of 12 microsatellite loci confirmed that the genome is
   very similar between the terminal forms (F(ST) = 0). Two AFLP-derived
   markers filtered out from a genomic scan instead appear to be maintained
   by selection. These markers exhibited steep clines at the secondary
   contact zone in Scandinavia, but as for the phenotypic traits, had
   vastly different cline centres east of the Baltic Sea. The trait clines
   along the ring distribution outside the Scandinavian secondary contact
   zone thus seem to have been shaped by independent action of selection or
   drift during the process of postglacial colonization.}},

Abstract = {{The role of hybridization in animal speciation is controversial and
   recent research has challenged the long-standing criterion of complete
   reproductive isolation to attain species status. The
   speciation-with-gene-flow model posits that the genome is semi-permeable
   and hybridization may be a phase in the process of divergence. Here, we
   apply these concepts to a previously identified zone of mtDNA
   introgression between the two strongly morphologically differentiated
   subspecies of red-tailed chipmunk (Tamias ruficaudus) in the US Inland
   Northwest. Using multilocus genotype data from the southern, older
   contact zone, we demonstrate that neutral gene flow is unusually low
   between the subspecies across the Lochsa River. This is geographically
   congruent with the discontinuity in bacular morphology, indicating that
   the cline of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes is displaced.
   Furthermore, we elucidate the evolutionary forces responsible by testing
   hypotheses of lineage sorting and hybridization. We determined that
   introgressive hybridization is the cause of mtDNA/morphology
   incongruence because there are non-zero levels of migration and gene
   flow. Although our estimate of the age of the hybrid zone has wide
   credibility intervals, the hybridization events occurred in the Late
   Pleistocene and the divergence occurred in the Middle Pleistocene.
   Finally, we assessed substructure within and adjacent to the hybrid zone
   and found that the hybrid zone constitutes a set of populations that are
   genetically differentiated from parental sets of populations; therefore,
   hybridization in this system is not likely an evolutionary sink, but has
   generated novel combinations of genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Divergent natural selection is thought to play a vital role in
   speciation, but clear, measurable examples from nature are still few.
   Among the many possible sources of divergent natural selection,
   predation pressure may be important because predators are ubiquitous in
   food webs. Here, we show evidence for divergent natural selection in a
   Lake Tanganyika cichlid, Telmatochromis temporalis, which uses burrows
   under stones or empty snail shells as shelters. This species contains
   normal and dwarf morphs at several localities. The normal morph inhabits
   rocky shorelines, whereas the dwarf morph invariably inhabits shell
   beds, where empty snail shells densely cover the lake bottom. Genetic
   evidence suggested that the dwarf morph evolved independently from the
   normal morph at two areas, and morphological analysis and evaluation of
   habitat structure revealed that the body sizes of morphs closely matched
   the available shelter sizes in their habitats. These findings suggest
   that the two morphs repeatedly evolved through divergent natural
   selection associated with the strategy for sheltering from predators.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the genetic architecture of adaptive traits is fundamental
   to understanding how organisms respond to their environment, over both
   ecological and evolutionary timeframes. Microarray technology that
   allows us to capture the simultaneous expression of thousands of genes
   provides unparalleled insight into how organisms cope with their
   environment at the transcriptional level. Recent studies in Molecular
   Ecology demonstrate how microarrays can rapidly identify which genes and
   pathways allow organisms to face some of the most fundamental
   physiological challenges posed by the environment, including
   compensation for the hypoxic and thermal stress of high-altitudes
   (Cheviron et al. 2008) and, in this issue, the biotransformation of
   toxic plant secondary compounds by mammals (Magnanou et al. 2009).
   Microarrays (Ekins et al. 1989; Fodor et al. 1991) are glass slides
   affixed with hundreds to thousands of oligonucleotide or cDNA sequences
   (probes). Messenger RNA transcripts (typically reverse transcribed to
   cDNA) are isolated from a tissue/sample of interest and hybridized to
   the array. Binding to specific probes indicates that a particular gene
   was transcriptionally active at or near the time of sampling and thus
   provides a potentially comprehensive measure of gene expression.
   Although a tremendously powerful tool, commercially produced
   oligonucleotide arrays are only available for a handful of model
   organisms. Nonetheless, evolutionary ecologists have exploited this
   resource by using a cross-species hybridization approach (e.g. Saetre et
   al. 2004), that is, hybridizing a model organism array with a nonmodel
   sample (Bar-Or et al. 2007). Magnanou et al. (2009) present a novel
   example of using a model muroid microarray (Agilent Technologies,
   Rattus) to study physiological response in a wild, nonmodel muroid,
   Neotoma.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Many self-incompatible plant species exist in continuous populations in
   which individuals disperse locally. Local dispersal of pollen and seeds
   facilitates inbreeding because pollen pools are likely to contain
   relatives. Self-incompatibility promotes outbreeding because relatives
   are likely to carry incompatible alleles. Therefore, populations can
   experience an antagonism between these forces. In this study, a novel
   computational model is used to explore the effects of this antagonism on
   gene flow, allelic diversity, neighbourhood sizes, and identity by
   descent. I confirm that this antagonism is sensitive to dispersal levels
   and linkage. However, the results suggest that there is little to no
   difference between the effects of gametophytic and sporophytic
   self-incompatibility systems (GSI and SSI) on unlinked loci. More
   importantly, both GSI and SSI affect unlinked loci in a manner similar
   to obligate outcrossing without mating types. This suggests that the
   primary evolutionary impact of self-incompatibility systems may be to
   prevent selfing, and prevention of biparental inbreeding might be a
   beneficial side-effect.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the process of population expansion and ascertain the
   origin of the Sea of Japan population, in a noxious red tide forming
   dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides, 13 samples, isolated from 11
   different localities in Japanese and Korean coasts, were analysed using
   10 polymorphic microsatellites. Analyses by nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling plots of pairwise F(ST), global amova, and genetic admixture
   analysis identified three clusters - the Sea of Japan populations,
   Yatsushiro Sea (Kumamoto Pref.) populations, and other populations -
   indicating genetic structuring of the 13 samples into three distinct
   populations. In the proportion of shared alleles by pairwise individuals
   (P(SAxy)) analyses between the Sea of Japan and the other samples,
   P(SAxy) was extremely low compared with that among the Sea of Japan or
   among other samples, indicating that a large genetic barrier has
   occurred between the populations. No significant relationship of
   isolation-by-distance patterns and almost no genetic distance were
   detected between pairwise samples of the Sea of Japan, although there is
   a maximal distance of > 600 km between samples. In addition, P(SAxy)
   data among the samples were extremely high compared with those among
   other samples, clearly showing that a large-scale transfer from west to
   east has occurred via the Tushima Warm Current. In the P(SAxy) data of
   the Seto Inland Sea and Pacific samples, individuals showing relatively
   high P(SAxy) were concentrated in the three areas of Nagasaki, Harima,
   and Mie, suggesting that frequent transfer may have occurred by
   human-assisted dispersal, although Nagasaki and Mie are separated by a
   distance of approximately 700 km.}},

Abstract = {{Species often occur in subdivided populations as a consequence of
   spatial heterogeneity of the habitat. To describe the spatial
   organization of subpopulations, existing theory proposes three main
   population models: patchy population, metapopulation and isolated
   populations. These models differ in their predicted levels of
   connectivity among subpopulations, and in the risk that a subpopulation
   will go extinct. However, spatially discrete subpopulations are commonly
   considered to be organized as metapopulations, even though explicit
   tests of metapopulation assumptions are rare. Here, we test predictions
   of the three models on the basis of demographic and genetic data, a
   combined approach so far surprisingly little used in mobile organisms.
   From 2002 to 2005, we studied nine subpopulations of the
   wetland-restricted reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) in the
   southeastern part of the Canton Zurich (Switzerland), from which local
   declines of this species have been reported. Here, wetlands are as small
   as 2.7 ha and separated through intensively used agricultural
   landscapes. Demographic data consisted of dispersal of colour-banded
   individuals among subpopulations, immigration rates and
   extinction-/recolonization dynamics. Genetic data were based on the
   distribution of genetic variability and gene flow among subpopulations
   derived from the analysis of nine microsatellite loci. Both demographic
   and genetic data revealed that the patchy population model best
   described the spatial organization of reed bunting subpopulations. High
   levels of dispersal among subpopulations, high immigration into the
   patchy population, and genetic admixture suggested little risk of
   extinction of both subpopulations and the entire patchy population. This
   study exemplifies the idea that spatially discrete subpopulations may be
   organized in ways other than a metapopulation, and hence has
   implications for the conservation of subpopulations and species.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding has the potential to cause evolutionary changes in
   populations, although these changes are likely to drive populations to
   extinction through inbreeding depression and reductions in genetic
   diversity. We investigated the mating system and late-stage inbreeding
   depression (delta) in 10 populations of Magnolia stellata using nine
   microsatellite markers and evaluated the effects of population size and
   the degree of population isolation through inbreeding and inbreeding
   depression on the persistence of populations. The outcrossing rates were
   very similar (similar to 0.7) among populations, but the correlations of
   paternity, fractions of biparental inbreeding and inbreeding
   coefficients at the seed stage (F(S)) varied among populations,
   suggesting that the level of outcrossing was similar among populations,
   while the quality of it was not. A significant negative correlation was
   detected between F(S) and population size. The average value of delta
   was 0.709, and the values in six of the 10 populations were significant.
   The values of delta differed among populations, although clear
   relationships with population size and the degree of population
   isolation were not detected. However, in one population, which was very
   small and located in the edge of the species' range, we obtained a very
   low value of delta (-0.096), which may be indicative of purging or the
   fixation of deleterious alleles. Existing M. stellata populations that
   are small (and thus might be expected to have higher frequencies of
   inbreeding) and have large values of delta may be in danger of
   declining, even if the populations are located within the central region
   of the species' range.}},

Abstract = {{The mitochondrial DNA of corals and their anthozoan kin evolves slowly,
   with substitution rates about two orders of magnitude lower than in
   typical bilateral animals. This has impeded the delineation of closely
   related species and isolated populations in corals, compounding problems
   caused by high morphological plasticity. Here we characterize rates of
   divergence and levels of variation for three nuclear gene regions, then
   use these nuclear sequences as markers to test for population structure
   in Oculina, a taxonomically confused genus of corals. Rates of sequence
   divergence (obtained by comparison to Solenastrea hyades) were at least
   five (and sometimes over 10) times faster for the three nuclear markers
   than for a mitochondrial reference sequence. Nuclear sequence variation
   was also high within populations, although it tended to decline north of
   Cape Canaveral. Significant subdivision was evident among samples from
   10 locations from between North Carolina and the Florida Panhandle, but
   neither nominal species designation nor population depth explained much
   of this variation. Instead, a single population from the unique deep (>
   70 m) water reefs at the Oculina Banks off central Florida was a strong
   genetic outlier: all pairwise measures of subdivision involving this
   population were greater than those involving all other populations, and
   multilocus clustering recognized the Oculina Banks as distinct from
   other populations, despite its close proximity (<= 36 km) to populations
   from shallower waters nearby and its location at the centre of the
   sampled range. Genetic isolation of the Oculina Banks population
   suggests that focused efforts will be needed to conserve the foundation
   species of these monotypic reefs and that depth may play a role in
   isolating marine populations and perhaps facilitating initial steps
   towards speciation.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of demographically independent populations and the
   recognition of management units have been greatly facilitated by the
   continuing advances in genetic tools. Managements units now play a key
   role in short-term conservation management programmes of declining
   species, but their importance in expanding populations receives
   comparatively little attention. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin
   (Megadyptes antipodes) expanded its range from the subantarctic to New
   Zealand's South Island a few hundred years ago and this new population
   now represents almost half of the species' total census size. This
   dramatic expansion attests to M. antipodes' high dispersal abilities and
   suggests the species is likely to constitute a single demographic
   population. Here we test this hypothesis of panmixia by investigating
   genetic differentiation and levels of gene flow among penguin breeding
   areas using 12 autosomal microsatellite loci along with mitochondrial
   control region sequence analyses for 350 individuals. Contrary to our
   hypothesis, however, the analyses reveal two genetically and
   geographically distinct assemblages: South Island vs. subantarctic
   populations. Using assignment tests, we recognize just two
   first-generation migrants between these populations (corresponding to a
   migration rate of < 2\%), indicating that ongoing levels of
   long-distance migration are low. Furthermore, the South Island
   population has low genetic variability compared to the subantarctic
   population. These results suggest that the South Island population was
   founded by only a small number of individuals, and that subsequent
   levels of gene flow have remained low. The demographic independence of
   the two populations warrants their designation as distinct management
   units and conservation efforts should be adjusted accordingly to protect
   both populations.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The ability of herbivores to switch diets is thought to be governed by
   biotransformation enzymes. To identify potential biotransformation
   enzymes, we conducted a large-scale study on the expression of
   biotransformation enzymes in herbivorous woodrats (Neotoma lepida). We
   compared gene expression in a woodrat population from the Great Basin
   that feeds on the ancestral diet of juniper to one from the Mojave
   Desert that putatively switched from feeding on juniper to feeding on
   creosote. Juniper and creosote have notable differences in secondary
   chemistry, and thus, should require different biotransformation enzymes
   for detoxification. Individuals from each population were fed juniper
   and creosote diets separately. After the feeding trials, hepatic mRNA
   was extracted and hybridized to laboratory rat microarrays.
   Hybridization of woodrat samples to biotransformation probes on the
   array was 87\%, resulting in a total of 224 biotransformation genes that
   met quality control standards. Overall, we found large differences in
   expression of biotransformation genes when woodrats were fed juniper vs.
   creosote. Mojave woodrats had greater expression of 10x as many
   biotransformation genes as did Great Basin woodrats on a creosote diet.
   We identified 24 candidate genes that may be critical in the
   biotransformation of creosote toxins. Superoxide dismutase, a free
   radical scavenger, was also expressed to a greater extent by the Mojave
   woodrats and may be important in controlling oxidative damage during
   biotransformation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   biotransformation enzymes limit diet switching and that woodrats in the
   Mojave have evolved a unique strategy for the biotransformation of
   creosote toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing utilization and human population density in the coastal zone
   is widely believed to place increasing stresses on the resident biota,
   but confirmation of this belief is somewhat lacking. While we have solid
   evidence that highly disturbed estuarine systems have dramatic changes
   in the resident biota (black and white if you will), we lack tools that
   distinguish the shades of grey. In part, this lack of ability to
   distinguish shades of grey stems from the analytical tools that have
   been applied to studies of estuarine systems, and perhaps more
   important, is the insensitivity of the biological end points that we
   have used to assess these impacts. In this study, we will present data
   on the phenotypic adjustments as measured by transcriptomic signatures
   of a resilient organism (oysters) to land-use practices in the
   surrounding watershed using advanced machine-learning algorithms. We
   will demonstrate that such an approach can reveal subtle and meaningful
   shifts in oyster gene expression in response to land use. Further, the
   data show that gill tissues are far more responsive and provide superior
   discrimination of land-use classes than hepatopancreas and that
   transcripts encoding proteins involved in energy production, protein
   synthesis and basic metabolism are more robust indicators of land use

   Cd-Metallothionein gene uncovers molecular adaptation towards plasticity

Abstract = {{Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of multifunctional proteins
   involved, among others, in stress response. The Cadmium (Cd)-MT gene of
   the Roman snail (Helix pomatia), for example, encodes for a protein
   induced upon cadmium exposure. While our previous studies have
   demonstrated that the expressed Cd-MT isoform of Roman snails assists
   detoxification of cadmium, the present work focuses on the potential
   plasticity of this gene in response to a variety of environmental
   stressors playing a crucial role in the specific ecological niche of H.
   pomatia. Our hypothesis is based on a bioinformatic approach involving
   gene sequencing, structural and in silico analysis of transcription
   factor binding sites (TFBs), and a comparison of these features with
   other MT genes. Our results show that the Roman snail's Cd-MT gene not
   only is the largest known MT gene, but also contains - apart from the
   regulatory promoter region - several intronic repeat cassettes of
   putative TFBs suggested to be involved in environmental stress response,
   immune competence, and regulation of gene expression. Moreover, intronic
   scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) and stress-induced duplex
   destabilization sites confer a high potential for epigenetic gene
   regulation. This suggested regulatory plasticity is also supported by
   physiological data showing that Cd-MT in Roman snails can be induced
   differentially not only after cadmium exposure, but also in response to
   nonmetallic environmental stressors. It is concluded that structural
   analysis combined with bioinformatic screening may constitute valuable
   tools for predicting the potential for plasticity and niche-specific
   adaptation of stress-responsive genes in populations living under
   rapidly changing environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of reproduction in birds varies considerably within
   populations and is often under strong natural selection. Individual
   timing within years is dependent on a range of environmental factors in
   addition to having an additive genetic basis. In vertebrates, an
   increasing amount is known about the molecular basis for variation in
   biological timing. The Clock gene includes a variable poly-glutamine
   (poly-Q) repeat influencing behaviour and physiology. Recent work in
   birds, fish and insects has demonstrated associations between Clock
   genotype and latitude across populations, which match latitudinal
   variation in breeding time. In this study, we investigated the
   phenotypic correlates of variation in Clock genotype within a single
   blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus population over two successive breeding
   seasons. In females, but not in males, we observed a general trend for
   birds with fewer poly-Q repeats to breed earlier in the season.
   Incubation duration was shorter in both females and males with fewer
   repeats at the polymorphic Clock locus. Poly-Q Clock allele-frequency
   was homogenously distributed within the study population and did not
   exhibit any consistent environment-related variation. We further tested
   for effects of Clock genotype on reproductive success and survival, and
   found that females with fewer poly-Q repeats produced a higher number of
   fledged offspring. Our results therefore suggest that (i) selection in
   females, but not in males, for fewer poly-Q repeats may be operating,
   (ii) the across-population associations in timing of breeding involving
   this locus could be linked to variation within populations, and (iii)
   the Clock gene might be involved in local adaptation to seasonal
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The geographic ranges of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus (M.
   fascicularis) macaques adjoin in Indochina where they appear to
   hybridize. We used published and newly generated DNA sequences from 19
   loci spanning similar to 20 kb to test whether introgression has
   occurred between these macaque species. We studied introgression at the
   level of nuclear DNA and distinguished between incomplete lineage
   sorting of ancestral polymorphisms or interspecific gene flow. We
   implemented a divergence population genetics approach by fitting our
   data to an isolation model implemented in the software IMa. The model
   that posits no gene flow from the rhesus into the cynomolgus macaque was
   rejected (P = 1.99 x 10(-8)). Gene flow in this direction was estimated
   as 2Nm similar to 1.2, while gene flow in the reverse direction was
   nonsignificantly different from zero (P = 0.16). The divergence time
   between species was estimated as similar to 1.3 million years. Balancing
   selection, a special case of incomplete sorting, was taken into
   consideration, as well as potential crossbreeding in captivity.
   Parameter estimates varied between analyses of subsets of data, although
   we still rejected isolation models. Geographic sampling of the data,
   where samples of cynomolgus macaques derived from Indochina were
   excluded, revealed a lost signature of gene flow, indicating that
   interspecific gene flow is restricted to mainland Indochina. Our
   results, in conjunction with those by others, justify future detailed
   analyses into the genetics of reproductive barriers and reticulate
   evolution in these two genome-enabled primates. Future studies of the
   natural hybridization between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques would
   expand the repertoire of systems available for speciation studies in
   primates.}},

Abstract = {{The Gulf of California endemic reef fish, Acanthemblemaria crockeri
   (Blennioidei, Chaenopsidae), reportedly has two colour morphs, one with
   melanic lateral spots ('Gulf' morph) and one with orange spots ('Cape'
   morph). In this study, we recorded colour morph in both males and
   females and collected mitochondrial DNA sequence data for cytochrome c
   oxidase I (COI) and tRNA-Pro/D-loop of specimens from throughout the
   Gulf to explore the genetic basis of the colour morphs. Two highly
   divergent (HKY + I distance = 11.9\% for COI), reciprocally monophyletic
   lineages were identified, consistent with the presence of two parapatric
   species. A 30-km gap between the distributions of mitochondrial lineages
   roughly corresponds to a hypothesized former seaway across the Baja
   California peninsula north of La Paz, although the estimated divergence
   time (1.84 million years ago) is more recent than the hypothetical
   seaway (3-4 million years ago). Surprisingly, the distribution of
   mitochondrial species is not congruent with the distribution of either
   male or female colour morphs. Our analysis also revealed significant
   population differentiation within both species and no shared haplotypes
   among populations. The northern Gulf species includes four populations
   (NB, CB, NM and CM) corresponding to northern and central Baja and
   northern and central mainland sites, while the Cape species includes two
   populations (SB and SM) corresponding to the Baja and mainland sides of
   the southern Gulf. The NB/CB division corresponds to a hypothesized
   Plio-Pleistocene mid-peninsular seaway. The level of genetic divergence
   documented in this lineage is extraordinary for a marine fish with a
   pelagic larval stage within a semi-enclosed basin.}},

Abstract = {{The Pyrenean region exhibits high levels of endemism suggesting a major
   contribution to the phylogeography of European species. But, to date,
   the role of the Pyrenees and surrounding areas as a glacial refugium for
   temperate species remains poorly explored. In the current study, we
   investigated the biogeographic role of the Pyrenean region through the
   analyses of genetic polymorphism and morphology of a typical
   forest-dwelling small mammal, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Analyses
   of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the third upper molar (M(3))
   show a complex phylogeographic structure in the Pyrenean region with at
   least three distinct lineages: the Western European, Spanish and Basque
   lineages. The Basque lineage in the northwestern (NW) Pyrenees was
   identified as a new clearly differentiated and geographically localized
   bank vole lineage in Europe. The average M(3) shape of Basque bank voles
   suggests morphological differentiation but also restricted genetic
   exchanges with other populations. Our genetic and morphological results
   as well as palaeo-environmental and fossils records support the
   hypothesis of a new glacial refugium in Europe situated in the NW
   Pyrenees. The permissive microclimatic conditions that prevailed for a
   long time in this region may have allowed the survival of temperate
   species, including humans. Moreover, local differentiation around the
   Pyrenees is favoured by the opportunity for populations to track the
   shift of the vegetation belt in altitude rather than in latitude. The
   finding of the Basque lineage is in agreement with the high level of
   endemic taxa reported in the NW Pyrenees.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative phylogeographical studies in island archipelagos can reveal
   lineage-specific differential responses to the geological and climatic
   history. We analysed patterns of genetic diversity in six codistributed
   lineages of darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) in the central Aegean
   archipelago which differ in wing development and habitat preferences. A
   total of 600 specimens from 30 islands and eight adjacent mainland
   regions were sequenced for mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and
   nuclear Muscular protein 20. Individual gene genealogies were assessed
   for the presence of groups that obey an independent coalescent process
   using a mixed Yule coalescent model. The six focal taxa differed greatly
   in the number of coalescent groups and depth of lineage subdivision,
   which was closely mirrored by the degree of geographical structuring.
   The most severe subdivision at both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA
   level was found in flightless lineages associated with presumed stable
   compact-soil habitats (phrygana, maquis), in contrast to sand-obligate
   lineages inhabiting ephemeral coastal areas that displayed greater
   homogeneity across the archipelago. A winged lineage, although
   associated with stable habitats, showed no significant phylogenetic or
   geographical structuring. Patterns of nucleotide diversity and local
   genetic differentiation, as measured using Phi(ST) and hierarchical
   amova, were consistent with high levels of ongoing gene flow in the
   winged taxon; frequent local extinction and island recolonisation for
   flightless sand-obligate taxa; and very low gene flow and geographical
   structure largely defined by the palaeogeographical history of the
   region in flightless compact-soil taxa. These results show that
   differences in dispersal rate, mediated by habitat persistence, greatly
   influence the levels of phylogeographical subdivision in lineages that
   are otherwise subjected to the same geological events and palaeoclimatic
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{The colonisation history and genetic structure of the common vole
   (Microtus arvalis) was investigated in the region of the Alps by
   analysing the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtDNA) and 19
   microsatellite loci (nucDNA) for 137 voles from 52 localities. mtDNA
   data provided a much refined distribution of three highly divergent
   evolutionary lineages in the region compared to previous studies.
   Although high mountain ranges are widely accepted to be barriers for
   colonisation processes for many organisms and especially small
   terrestrial mammals, our phylogeographic analyses showed clear evidence
   of four transalpine colonisation events by the common vole.
   Individual-based phylogenetic analyses of nucDNA and two alternative
   Bayesian-clustering approaches revealed a deep genetic structure
   analogous to mtDNA. Incongruence between nucDNA and mtDNA at the
   individual level was restricted to the regions of contact between the
   lineages. mtDNA patterns and strong female philopatry in M. arvalis
   suggest that the crossings of the Alps occurred during the colonisation
   of the region when it was free from ice after the last glaciation.
   nucDNA patterns suggest that some of the transalpine elements of this
   phylogeographic pattern were subsequently eroded by male-biased gene
   flow. We conclude that the combination of phylogeography and landscape
   genetics at the individual level can provide very detailed insights into
   colonisation events and may even allow differentiation between
   historical and more recent processes.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most difficult interactions to observe in nature is the
   relationship between a predator and its prey. When direct observations
   are impossible, we rely on morphological classification of prey remains,
   although this is particularly challenging among generalist predators
   whose faeces contain mixed and degraded prey fragments. In this
   investigation, we used a polymerase chain reaction and sequence-based
   technique to identify prey fragments in the guano of the generalist
   insectivore, the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), and evaluate
   several hypotheses about prey selection and prey defences. The
   interaction between bats and insects is of significant evolutionary
   interest because of the adaptive nature of insect hearing against
   echolocation. However, measuring the successes of predator tactics or
   particular prey defences is limited because we cannot normally identify
   these digested prey fragments beyond order or family. Using a molecular
   approach, we recovered sequences from 89\% of the fragments tested, and
   through comparison to a reference database of sequences, we were able to
   identify 127 different species of prey. Our results indicate that
   despite the robust jaws of L. borealis, most prey taxa were
   softer-bodied Lepidoptera. Surprisingly, more than 60\% of the prey
   species were tympanate, with ears thought to afford protection against
   these echolocating bats. Moths of the family Arctiidae, which employ
   multiple defensive strategies, were not detected as a significant
   dietary component. Our results provide an unprecedented level of detail
   for the study of predator-prey relationships in bats and demonstrate the
   advantages which molecular tools can provide in investigations of
   complex ecological systems and food-web relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Salmon and trout populations are suffering declines in abundance and
   diversity over much of their range around the Atlantic and Pacific rims
   as a consequence of many factors. One method of dealing with the decline
   has been to produce them in hatcheries but the wisdom of this approach
   has been hotly debated (e.g. Hilborn \& Winton 1993; Waples 1999;
   Brannon et al. 2004). One concern is that domesticated hatchery strains
   will interbreed with locally adapted wild fish; but how do we study the
   genetic effects if the introgression might have occurred in the past?
   Hansen (2002) used DNA isolated from archived scales from brown trout,
   Salmo trutta (Fig. 1), to show that domesticated trout had, to varying
   degrees, genetically introgressed with wild, native trout in two Danish
   rivers. Extending that study, Hansen et al. (2009) have examined DNA
   from brown trout scales in six Danish rivers collected during historical
   (1927-1956) and contemporary (2000-2006) periods and from two hatchery
   source populations, to assess the effects of stocking nonlocal strains
   of hatchery trout and declining abundance on genetic diversity. Using 21
   microsatellite loci, they revealed that genetic change occurred between
   the historic and contemporary time periods. Many populations appeared to
   have some low level of introgression from hatchery stocks and two
   populations apparently experienced high levels of introgression. Hansen
   et al. (2009) also showed that population structure persists in
   contemporary populations despite apparent admixture and migration among
   populations, providing evidence that the locally adapted populations
   have struggled against and, to some extent, resisted being overwhelmed
   by repeated introductions of and interbreeding with non-native,
   hatchery-produced conspecifics.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Firmly rooted as we are in the genomic era, it can seem incredible that
   as recently as 1974, Lewontin declared, `we know virtually nothing about
   the genetic changes that occur in species formation'. To the contrary,
   we now know the genetic architecture of phenotypic differences and
   reproductive isolation between species for many diverse groups of
   plants, animals, and fungi. In recent years, detailed genetic analyses
   have produced a small but growing list of genes that cause reproductive
   isolation, several of which appear to have diverged by natural
   selection. Yet, a full accounting of the speciation process requires
   that we understand the reproductive and ecological properties of natural
   populations as they begin to diverge genetically, as well as the
   dynamics of newly evolved barriers to gene flow. One promising approach
   to this problem is the study of natural hybrid zones, where gene
   exchange between divergent populations can produce recombinant genotypes
   in situ. In such individuals, genomic variation might be shaped by
   introgression at universally adaptive or neutral loci, even as regions
   associated with local adaptation or reproductive isolation remain
   divergent. In Nolte et al. (2009), the authors take advantage of two
   independent, recently formed hybrid zones between sculpin species to
   investigate genome-wide patterns of reproductive isolation. Using a
   recently developed genomic clines method, the authors identify marker
   loci that are associated with isolation, and those that show evidence
   for adaptive introgression. Remarkably, Nolte et al. (2009) find little
   similarity between the two hybrid zones in patterns of introgression, a
   fact that might reflect genetic variation within species or
   heterogeneous natural selection. In either case, their study system has
   the potential to provide insight into the early stages of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of historical samples can provide invaluable information on
   changes to the genetic composition of natural populations resulting from
   human activities. Here, we analyse 21 microsatellite loci in historical
   (archived scales from 1927 to 1956) and contemporary samples of brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) from six neighbouring rivers in Denmark, to compare
   the genetic structure of wild populations before and after population
   declines and stocking with nonlocal strains of hatchery trout. We show
   that all populations have been strongly affected by stocking, with
   admixture proportions ranging from 14 to 64\%. Historical population
   genetic structure was characterized by isolation by distance and by
   positive correlations between historical effective population sizes and
   habitat area within river systems. Contemporary population genetic
   structure still showed isolation by distance, but also reflected
   differences among populations in hatchery trout admixture proportions.
   Despite significant changes to the genetic composition within
   populations over time, dispersal rates among populations were roughly
   similar before and after stocking. We also assessed whether population
   declines or introgression by hatchery strain trout should be the most
   significant conservation concern in this system. Based on theoretical
   considerations, we argue that population declines have had limited
   negative effects for the persistence of adaptive variation, but
   admixture with hatchery trout may have resulted in reduced local
   adaptation. Collectively, our study demonstrates the usefulness of
   analysing historical samples for identifying the most important
   consequences of human activities on the genetic structure of wild
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The marine environment presents particular challenges for our
   understanding of the factors that determine gene flow and consequent
   population structure. For marine fish, various aspects of life history
   have been considered important in an environment with few physical
   barriers, but dominated by current patterns, often varying with depth.
   These factors include the abundance and longevity of larval stages,
   typically more susceptible to movement along current paths. It also
   includes adult body size, fecundity and longevity with `r-selected'
   species typically thought capable of greater gene flow and consequent
   panmixia. Here we investigate the population genetics of the orange
   roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), a clearly `K-selected' species with
   habitat dependence on sea mounts for spawning, relatively large body
   size, a brief larval stage and relatively low fecundity. We used 14
   polymorphic microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis that these
   characteristics will result in philopatry and genetic structure in the
   Atlantic Ocean. We discuss possible evolutionary mechanisms that could
   explain the results, which show the opposite pattern, with effective
   panmixia across thousands of kilometres in the North Atlantic.}},

Abstract = {{The diversification of the teleost suborder Notothenioidei (Perciformes)
   in Antarctic waters provides one of the most striking examples of a
   marine adaptive radiation. Along with a number of adaptations to the
   cold environment, such as the evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins,
   notothenioids diversified into eight families and at least 130 species.
   Here, we investigate the genetic population structure of the humped
   rockcod (Gobionotothen gibberifrons), a benthic notothenioid fish. Six
   populations were sampled at different locations around the Scotia Sea,
   comprising a large part of the species' distribution range (N = 165).
   Our analyses based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data (352 bp) and eight
   microsatellite markers reveal a lack of genetic structuring over large
   geographic distances (Phi(ST) <= 0.058, F(ST) <= 0.005, P values
   nonsignificant). In order to test whether this was due to passive larval
   dispersal, we used GPS-tracked drifter trajectories, which approximate
   movement of passive surface particles with ocean currents. The drifter
   data indicate that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the
   sampling locations in one direction only (west-east), and that passive
   transport is possible within the 4-month larval period of G.
   gibberifrons. Indeed, when applying the isolation-with-migration model
   in IMA, strong unidirectional west-east migration rates are detected in
   the humped rockcod. This leads us to conclude that, in G. gibberifrons,
   genetic differentiation is prevented by gene flow via larval dispersal
   with the ACC.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean annual grasses have invaded California and have replaced

   Brachypodium distachyon, a new model species for the grasses with

   study shows that the level of genetic variation in invaded California
   grasslands is lower compared to the native range in Eurasia. The invaded
   regions are characterized by highly differentiated populations of B.
   distachyon isolated by distance, most likely as a result of founder
   effects and a dearth of outcrossing events. EXP6 and EXP10 encoding
   alpha-expansins responsible for rapid growth, and AGL11 and AGL13
   encoding proteins involved in vegetative phase regulation, appear to be
   under purifying selection with no evidence for local adaptation. Our
   data show that B. distachyon has diverged only recently from related
   Brachypodium species and that tetraploidization might have been as
   recent as a few thousand years ago. Observed low genetic variation in
   EXP10 and AGL13 appears to have been present in Eurasia before
   tetraploidization, potentially as a result of strong selective pressures
   on advantageous mutations, which are most likely responsible for its
   fast growth and rapid completion of its life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The study of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations is
   central to evolutionary biology. Quantitative genetics methods, however,
   are hardly applicable to long-lived organisms, and current knowledge on
   adaptive genetic variation in wild plants mostly refers to annuals and
   short-lived perennials. Studies on long-lived species are essential to
   explore possible life-history correlates of genetic variation,
   selection, and trait heritability. In this paper, we propose a method
   based on molecular markers to quantify the genetic basis of individual
   phenotypic differences in wild plants under natural conditions. Rather
   than focusing on inferring individual relatedness to estimate the
   heritability of phenotypic traits, we directly estimate the proportion
   of observed phenotypic variance that is statistically accounted for by
   genotypic differences between individuals. This is achieved by (i)
   identifying loci that are correlated across individuals with the
   phenotypic trait of interest by means of an amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP)-based explorative genomic scan, and (ii) fitting
   multiple regression and linear random effect models to estimate the
   effects of genotype, environment and genotype x environment on
   phenotypes. We apply this method to estimate genotypic and environmental
   effects on cumulative maternal fecundity in a wild population of the
   long-lived Viola cazorlensis monitored for 20 years. Results show that
   between 56-63\% (depending on estimation method) of phenotypic variance
   in fecundity is accounted for by genotypic differences in 11 AFLP loci
   that are significantly related to fecundity. Genotype x environment
   effects accounted for 38\% of fecundity variance, which may help to
   explain the unexpectedly high levels of genetic variance for fecundity
   found.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that reproductive isolation may be due to intrinsic
   genetic incompatibilities or extrinsic ecological factors. Therefore, an
   understanding of the genetic basis of isolation may require analyses of
   evolutionary processes in situ to include environmental factors. Here we
   study genetic isolation between populations of sculpins (Cottus) at 168
   microsatellites. Genomic clines were fit using 480 individuals sampled
   across independent natural hybrid zones that have formed between one
   invading species and two separate populations of a resident species. Our
   analysis tests for deviations from neutral patterns of introgression at
   individual loci based on expectations given genome-wide admixture.
   Roughly 51\% of the loci analysed displayed significant deviations. An
   overall deficit of interspecific heterozygotes in 26\% and 21\% of the
   loci suggests that widespread underdominance drives genomic isolation.
   At the same time, selection promotes introgression of almost 30\% of the
   markers, which implies that hybridization may increase the fitness of
   admixed individuals. Cases of overdominance or epistatic interactions
   were relatively rare. Despite the similarity of the two hybrid zones in
   their overall genomic composition, patterns observed at individual loci
   show little correlation between zones and many fit different genotypic
   models of fitness. At this point, it remains difficult to determine
   whether these results are due to differences in external selection
   pressures or cryptic genetic differentiation of distinct parental
   populations. In the future, data from mapped genetic markers and on
   variation of ecological factors will provide additional insights into
   the contribution of these factors to variation in the evolutionary
   consequences of hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The inheritance of mitochondrial genes and genomes are uniparental in
   most sexual eukaryotes. This pattern of inheritance makes mitochondrial
   genomes in natural populations effectively clonal. Here, we examined the
   mitochondrial population genetics of the emerging human pathogenic
   fungus Cryptococcus gattii. The DNA sequences for five mitochondrial DNA
   fragments were obtained from each of 50 isolates belonging to two
   evolutionary divergent lineages, VGI and VGII. Our analyses revealed a
   greater sequence diversity within VGI than that within VGII, consistent
   with observations of the nuclear genes. The combined analyses of all
   five gene fragments indicated significant divergence between VGI and
   VGII. However, the five individual genealogies showed different
   relationships among the isolates, consistent with recent hybridization
   and mitochondrial gene transfer between the two lineages. Population
   genetic analyses of the multilocus data identified evidence for
   predominantly clonal mitochondrial population structures within both
   lineages. Interestingly, there were clear signatures of recombination
   among mitochondrial genes within the VGII lineage. Our analyses suggest
   historical mitochondrial genome divergence within C. gattii, but there
   is evidence for recent hybridization and recombination in the
   mitochondrial genome of this important human yeast pathogen.}},

Title = {{The genomic legacy from the extinct Lepus timidus to the three hare
   species of Iberia: contrast between mtDNA, sex chromosomes and autosomes}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Extensive interspecific genetic introgression is often reported, and
   appraising its genomic impact can serve to determine whether it results
   from selection on specific loci or from demographic processes affecting
   the whole genome. The three species of hares present in the Iberian
   Peninsula harbour high frequencies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from
   Lepus timidus, an arctic/boreal species now extinct in the region. This
   could result from the invasive replacement of L. timidus by the
   temperate species during deglaciation but should then have left traces
   in the nuclear genome. We typed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   discovered by sequencing 10 autosomal loci, two X-linked and one
   Y-linked in species-wide samples of the four taxa. Based on
   lineage-diagnostic SNPs, we detected no trace of L. timidus sex
   chromosomes in Iberia. From the frequencies of inferred haplotypes,
   autosomal introgression into L. granatensis appeared mostly sporadic but
   always widespread instead of restricted to the north as mtDNA. Autosomal
   introgression into Iberian L. europaeus, inhabiting the Pyrenean
   foothills, was hardly detectable, despite quasi-fixation of L. timidus
   mtDNA. L. castroviejoi, endemic to the Cantabrian Mountains and fixed
   for L. timidus mtDNA, showed little traces of autosomal introgression.
   The absence of sex-chromosome introgression presumably resulted from
   X-linked hybrid male unfitness. The contrasting patterns between the
   autosomes and mtDNA could reflect general gender asymmetric processes
   such as frequency-dependent female assortative mating, lower mtDNA
   migration and higher male dispersal, but adaptive mtDNA introgression
   cannot be dismissed. Additionally, we document reciprocal introgression
   between L. europaeus and both L. granatensis in Iberia and L. timidus
   outside Iberia.}},

Abstract = {{Apart from the common floral architecture in Brassicaceae, variation in
   flower morphology occurs in several genera within the family and is
   considered to affect speciation processes. We analysed genetic
   differentiation and flowering time variation of two floral variants of
   Capsella bursa-pastoris, the Spe variant and the wild-type, which occur
   sympatrically in a vineyard in southwest Germany. The Spe variant is
   characterized by an additional whorl of stamens instead of petals and
   was formerly classified as an independent taxon `Capsella apetala' Opiz.
   Amplified fragment length polymorphism and allozyme analysis revealed a
   substantial genetic differentiation of the two floral variants and a
   higher genetic variation within the wild-type subpopulation compared
   with the Spe subpopulation. The low genetic variation in the mutant
   provided evidence of a recent local origin or recent introduction.
   Flowering time analysis indicated that, within the analysed population,
   the Spe variant flowers significantly later than the wild-type (P <
   0.001). We conclude that the evolution and persistence of Spe within a
   wild-type population is facilitated by high selfing rates and been
   enhanced by a shift in flowering phenology. Hence, our data provide
   substantial evidence that the Spe phenotype has established itself as an
   isolated entity within a wild-type population and may thus serve as a
   model for the analysis of the evolutionary significance of homeotic
   mutants in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil, archaeological, and morphometric data suggest that indigenous
   red foxes in North America were derived from vicariance in two disjunct
   refugia during the last glaciation: one in Beringia and one in the
   contiguous USA. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a
   phylogeographical analysis of the North American red fox within its
   presettlement range. We sequenced portions of the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b (354 bp) gene and D-loop (342 bp) from 220 historical red
   fox specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome b gene produced
   two clades that diverged c. 400 000 years before present (bp): a
   Holarctic and a Nearctic clade. D-loop analyses of the Nearctic clade
   indicated three distinct subclades (>= 99\% Bayesian posterior
   probability); two that were more recently derived (rho estimate c. 20
   000 bp) and were restricted to the southwestern mountains and the
   eastern portion of North America, and one that was older (rho estimate
   c. 45 000 bp) and more widespread in North America. Populations that
   migrated north from the southern refugium following deglaciation were
   derived from the colonization of North America during or prior to the
   Illinoian glaciation (300 000-130 000 bp), whereas populations that
   migrated south from the northern refugium represent a more recent

Abstract = {{The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a well-known forest animal
   distributed all over Europe. Still, we are far from having a firm
   knowledge of the species' phylogeography. This study investigates the
   genetic differentiation of S. vulgaris across the species' Eurasian
   range, using sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA gene (D-loop, 252
   base pairs, cytochrome b, 359 base pairs), and eight variable autosomal
   microsatellite loci genotyped for 236 individuals. The results reveal
   the presence of two main mitochondrial phylogroups. The first clade
   comprises the individuals from the region of Calabria in southern Italy,
   belonging to the subspecies S. v. meridionalis, while the second clade
   contains the remainder of the studied individuals. Bayesian analysis of
   microsatellite genotypes resulted in three main clusterings
   corresponding to the three S. vulgaris subspecies: infuscatus,
   meridionalis and fuscoater. Geographical distribution of mtDNA
   haplotypes and mismatch analysis suggest a common refugium for the red
   squirrel across most of its present range from which expansion happened
   rather rapidly. The genotype mixing of italicus with northern
   populations could be a residual of postglacial expansion. The lack of
   mixing between the Calabrian lineage and the rest of European red
   squirrel haplotypes can be seen as evidence for distinct histories
   throughout the Pleistocene. Calabrian mtDNA probably diverged in an ice
   age contraction and remained isolated from the neighbouring squirrel
   populations until very recent times.}},

Abstract = {{Myricaria species in China occur mostly in the major high-altitude
   mountain areas in and around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The one major
   exception to this is M. laxiflora which is restricted to the Three
   Gorges mountain region. In this study, we investigate species-level
   phylogeographical patterns of Myricaria species in western China and the
   origin of M. laxiflora. The results show that most chloroplast
   haplotypes are species-specific, except for one haplotype which is
   shared by three widespread species. Higher haplotype diversity within
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region supports the hypothesis that the
   Himalayas are the centre of origin for Myricaria. The phylogeny of
   Myricaria was geographically structured, and an estimated Bayesian
   chronology suggested the main divergence events occurred during the Late
   Pliocene and Early Pleistocene (similar to 1.46-2.30 million years ago).
   The overall phylogeographical pattern was characterized by vicariance
   events and regional demographical expansion, reflecting a major
   influence of geological and climatic events on the evolution of
   Myricaria species. Our data suggest that M. laxiflora has an ancient
   origin, but has experienced recent population expansion through the
   Three Gorges Valley. The origin of M. laxiflora was estimated to be
   during the Early Pleistocene but its demographical expansion was more
   recent at about 0.015 million years ago. This highlights the unique
   phylogeographical history of the Three Gorges mountain region, and the
   deep imprint of the watercourse connections of the Yangtze River Valley
   on the phylogeographical structure of the species in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies, which have found evidence for kin-biased egg donation,
   have sparked interest in re-assessing the parasitic nature of
   conspecific brood parasitism (CBP). Since host-parasite kinship is
   essential for mutual benefits to arise from CBP, we explored the role of
   relatedness in determining the behaviour of conspecific nest parasites
   and their hosts in nesting female Barrow's goldeneyes (Bucephala
   islandica), a duck in which CBP is common. The results revealed that the
   amount of parasitism increased with host-parasite relatedness, the
   effect of which was independent of geographical proximity of host and
   parasite nests. Proximity per se was also positively associated with the
   amount of parasitism. Furthermore, while hosts appeared to reduce their
   clutch size as a response to the presence of parasitic eggs, the
   magnitude of host clutch reduction also tended to increase with
   increasing relatedness to the parasite. Hence, our results indicate that
   both relatedness and spatial proximity are important determinants of
   CBP, and that host clutch reduction may be an adaptation to nest
   parasitism, modulated by host-parasite relatedness. Taken together, the
   results provide a demonstration that relatedness influences host and
   parasite behaviour in Barrow's goldeneyes, resulting in kin-biased egg
   donation.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction by workers is rare in honey bee colonies that have an
   active queen. By not producing their own offspring and preventing other
   workers from producing theirs, workers are thought to increase their
   inclusive fitness due to their higher average relatedness towards
   queen-produced male offspring compared with worker-produced male
   offspring. But there is one exception. Workers of the Cape honey bee,
   Apis mellifera capensis, are able to produce diploid female offspring
   via thelytokous parthenogenesis and thus produce clones of themselves.
   As a result, worker reproduction and tolerance towards worker-produced
   offspring is expected to be more permissive than in arrhenotokous
   (sub)species where worker offspring are male. Here we quantify the
   extent to which A. m. capensis workers contribute to reproduction in
   queenright colonies using microsatellite analyses of pre-emergent brood.
   We show that workers produced 10.5\% of workers and 0.48\% of drones.
   Most of the workers' contribution towards the production of new workers
   coincided with the colonies producing new queens during reproductive
   swarming.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of fine-scale genetic structure in a population may reflect
   current biological processes of the species, such as natal dispersal,
   the breeding system and demography. We investigated the spatial
   distribution of nests and fine-scale genetic structure during two
   breeding seasons in a population of a weakly territorial, flock-living
   passerine bird, the vinous-throated parrotbill, Paradoxornis webbianus.
   Nest distribution was clustered. There were two peaks of egg laying
   within each breeding season, and spatial clustering of nests was more
   extreme during the second peak after controlling for breeding density.
   The patterns of genetic structure during the breeding season varied with
   parental sex and season. Genetic structure occurred during the second
   laying peak: males breeding within 200 m of one another at this time
   were significantly more closely related than males breeding farther
   apart. However, no apparent genetic structure was detected in males
   during the first laying peak or among females in either laying peak.
   These results reveal male-oriented kin affiliation during part of the
   breeding season in this species. Furthermore, juvenile recruitment into
   the winter flocks was positively related to this increased relatedness
   among males via kin affiliation. This study implies that fine-scale
   genetic structure during the breeding season could be a factor
   determining individual fitness and may play an important role in our
   understanding of the evolution of social systems.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{A key question for molecular and behavioural ecologists who study mating
   systems is to understand why, in many species, females choose to mate
   with extra-pair males. Recently a possible explanation, `genetic
   compatibility', has gained increasing empirical support (for a
   comprehensive review, see Kempenaers 2007). Genetic compatibility
   hypotheses assume that females seek extra-pair mates with alleles that
   complement their own. Typically, this will be achieved by mating with a
   male of a different genotype than her own, in order to maximise the
   heterozygosity of her offspring. Because numerous studies have indicated
   positive associations between heterozygosity and fitness (see Coltman \&
   Slate 2003), it follows that mating with `compatible' males will result
   in heterozygous, and therefore fit, offspring. Most empirical support
   for genetic compatibility has been obtained with microsatellite markers
   that have first been used to assess parentage and then to estimate
   relatedness and/or individual heterozygosity. A problem with this
   approach is a possible bias that favours the detection of extra-pair
   paternity when the extra-pair male has a genotype different from that of
   the female and her social mate. This in turn could lead to the erroneous
   conclusion that extra-pair males are less related to the female than
   within-pair males. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Wetzel \&
   Westneat 2009 (hereafter W\&W), use simulation studies to assess the
   extent of this bias, using parameter estimates obtained from recent
   empirical data. They identify two forms of bias that may affect tests of
   the genetic compatibility hypothesis, and provide guidelines on how
   these biases may be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The power of population genetic analyses is often limited by sample size
   resulting from constraints in financial resources and time to genotype
   large numbers of individuals. This particularly applies to nonmodel
   species where detailed genomic knowledge is lacking. Next-generation
   sequencing technology using primers `tagged' with an individual barcode
   of a few nucleotides offers the opportunity to genotype hundreds of
   individuals at several loci in parallel (Binladen et al. 2007; Meyer et
   al. 2008). The large number of sequence reads can also be used to
   identify artefacts by frequency distribution thresholds intrinsically
   determined for each run and data set. In Babik et al. (2009),
   next-generation deep sequencing was used to genotype several major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIB loci of the European bank
   vole (Fig. 1). Their approach can be useful for many researchers working
   with complex multiallelic templates and large sample sizes.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary processes are routinely modelled using `ideal'
   Wright-Fisher populations of constant size N in which each individual
   has an equal expectation of reproductive success. In a hypothetical
   ideal population, variance in reproductive success (V(k)) is binomial
   and effective population size (N(e)) = N. However, in any actual
   implementation of the Wright Fisher model (e. g., in a computer), V(k)
   is a random variable and its realized value in any given replicate
   generation (V(k){*}) only rarely equals the binomial variance. Realized
   effective size (N(e){*}) thus also varies randomly in modelled ideal
   populations, and the consequences of this have not been adequately
   explored in the literature. Analytical and numerical results show that
   random variation V(k){*} and N(e){*} can seriously distort analyses that
   evaluate precision or otherwise depend on the assumption that N(e){*} is
   constant. We derive analytical expressions for Var(V(k))
   {[}4(2N-1)(N-1)/N(3)] and Var(N(e)) {[}N(N-1)/(2N-1) approximate to N/2]
   in modelled ideal populations and show that, for a genetic metric G =
   f(N(e)), Var((G) over cap) has two components: Var(Gene) (due to
   variance across replicate samples of genes, given a specific N(e){*})
   and Var(Demo) (due to variance N(e){*}). Var((G) over cap) is higher
   than it would be with constant Ne = N, as implicitly assumed by many
   standard models. We illustrate this with empirical examples based on F
   (standardized variance of allele frequency) and r(2) (a measure of
   linkage disequilibrium). Results demonstrate that in computer models
   that track multilocus genotypes, methods of replication and data
   analysis can strongly affect consequences of variation in N(e){*}. These
   effects are more important when sampling error is small (large numbers
   of individuals, loci and alleles) and with relatively small populations
   (frequently modelled by those interested in conservation).}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics is an emerging discipline that utilizes environmental
   and historical data to understand geographic patterns of genetic
   diversity. Niche modelling has added a new dimension to such efforts by
   allowing species-environmental associations to be projected into the
   past so that hypotheses about historical vicariance can be generated and
   tested independently with genetic data. However, previous approaches
   have primarily utilized DNA sequence data to test inferences about
   historical isolation and may have missed very recent episodes of
   environmentally mediated divergence. We type 15 microsatellite loci in
   California mule deer and identify five genetic groupings through a
   Structure analysis that are also well predicted by environmental data.
   We project the niches of these five deer ecotypes to the last glacial
   maximum (LGM) and show they overlap to a much greater extent than today,
   suggesting that vicariance associated with the LGM cannot explain the
   present-day genetic patterns. Further, we analyse mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) sequence trees to search for evidence of historical vicariance
   and find only two well-supported clades. A coalescence-based analysis of
   mtDNA data shows that the genetic divergence of the mule deer genetic
   clusters in California is recent and appears to be mediated by
   ecological factors. The importance of environmental factors in
   explaining the genetic diversity of California mule deer is unexpected
   given that they are highly mobile species and have a broad habitat
   distribution. Geographic differences in the timing of reproduction and
   peak vegetation as well as habitat choice reflecting natal origin may
   explain the persistence of genetic subdivision.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding factors that influence population connectivity and the
   spatial distribution of genetic variation is a major goal in molecular
   ecology. Improvements in the availability of high-resolution geographic
   data have made it increasingly possible to quantify the effects of
   landscape features on dispersal and genetic structure. However, most
   studies examining such landscape effects have been conducted at very
   fine (e.g. landscape genetics) or broad (e.g. phylogeography) spatial
   scales. Thus, the extent to which processes operating at fine spatial
   scales are linked to patterns at larger scales remains unclear. Here, we
   test whether factors impacting wood frog dispersal at fine spatial
   scales are correlated with genetic structure at regional scales. Using
   recently developed methods borrowed from electrical circuit theory, we
   generated landscape resistance matrices among wood frog populations in
   eastern North America based on slope, a wetness index, land cover and
   absolute barriers to wood frog dispersal. We then determined whether
   these matrices are correlated with genetic structure based on six
   microsatellite markers and whether such correlations outperform a
   landscape-free model of isolation by resistance. We observed significant
   genetic structure at regional spatial scales. However, topography and
   landscape variables associated with the intervening habitat between
   sites provide little explanation for patterns of genetic structure.
   Instead, absolute dispersal barriers appear to be the best predictor of
   regional genetic structure in this species. Our results suggest that
   landscape variables that influence dispersal, microhabitat selection and
   population structure at fine spatial scales do not necessarily explain
   patterns of genetic structure at broader scales.}},

Abstract = {{Direct comparison of genetic patterns between museum specimens and
   contemporary collections can be a powerful approach for detecting recent
   demographic changes. Using microsatellite markers, we examined
   historical and contemporary genetic variation from an apparently
   declining bumble bee species, Bombus pensylvanicus, and from a stable
   species, Bombus impatiens, in central Illinois. For each species, we
   genotyped specimens from the Illinois Natural History Survey collected
   from three populations between 1969-1972 and from a resurvey of the same
   areas conducted in 2008. Population structure in B. pensylvanicus
   increased markedly over the last four decades (from theta(ST) = 0.001 to
   0.027) while no structure was detected in B. impatiens for either time
   period (theta(ST) = -0.006 to -0.003). Changes in genetic diversity were
   not significant for either species, although small reductions were
   observed for B. pensylvanicus in all three populations. Coalescent
   simulations incorporating both contemporary and historical samples
   suggest that this small change is not surprising for recent population
   declines, as large reductions in genetic diversity were only apparent
   under the most severe bottleneck scenarios. These results demonstrate
   how comparisons of genetic patterns between temporal periods and species
   can help elucidate potential threats to population health and suggest
   several strategies that might be useful in the conservation of B.
   pensylvanicus in the Midwestern USA.}},

Abstract = {{The southeast Australian coast potentially includes a complex
   biogeographic barrier, largely lacking exposed rocky shore that may
   limit the dispersal of rocky intertidal taxa and contribute to the
   maintenance of two biogeographic regions. Surprisingly, within the
   300-km barrier region, several species considered exposed rocky shore
   specialists occurred within sheltered sites. We analysed COI sequence
   variation for 10 rocky intertidal invertebrate species, with a range of
   life histories, to test the hypotheses that larval type and habitat
   specificity are strong predictors of gene flow between biogeographic
   regions. Our data revealed that the southeast corner of Australia
   includes a strong barrier to gene flow for six of eight species with
   planktonic larvae, and a coalescence analysis of sequence
   differentiation (IM model) suggests that a barrier has existed since the
   Pleistocene. In contrast, two direct developers were not affected by the
   barrier. Our comparative approach and data from earlier studies
   (reviewed here) do not support the hypothesis that larval type predicts
   gene flow across this barrier, instead we found that the ability to
   utilize sheltered habitat provides a clearer explanation of the
   phylogeographic break. Indeed, the species that displayed little or no
   evidence of a phylogeographic break across the barrier each displayed
   unexpectedly relaxed habitat specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity hotspots are centres of endemism and thus contain many
   range-restricted species. In addition, within these hotspots occur
   widespread species that might have originated within a hotspot before
   dispersing to neighbouring or distant regions. We test this hypothesis
   with a phylogeographic analysis of a miniature leaf litter frog,
   Arthroleptis xenodactyloides, that has a large distribution throughout
   the Eastern Arc biodiversity hotspot and other regions in East Africa.
   Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimates of the mitochondrial gene
   phylogeny are used as a proxy for understanding the evolutionary history
   of diversification and the historical relationships between populations.
   The north-south range of this species extends for approximately 1900 km;
   our sampling covers approximately 85\% of this range. Using phylogenetic
   comparative methods, we estimate the region of origin and direction of
   dispersal within A. xenodactyloides. We compare contrasting hypotheses
   of latitudinal range expansion using bayes factors. The ancestral region
   of origin of A. xenodactyloides is reconstructed as having occurred
   within the Eastern Arc before dispersing southwards into the southern
   Rift Mountains, probably in the Pleistocene. The phylogeographic
   structure within this leaf litter frog is surprisingly similar to that
   of forest birds, revealing that similar geographic features might have
   had a driving role in diversification of these very dissimilar taxa.
   Latitudinal expansion occurred early in the evolutionary history of A.
   xenodactyloides, which may indicate that physiological adaptation
   facilitated its wide geographic distribution.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient
   vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the
   Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly
   distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of
   fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja
   floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also
   examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales.
   Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing
   and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical
   signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six
   codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a
   scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago
   (Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting
   events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c.
   3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade
   phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based
   inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which
   phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong
   evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the
   Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region,
   however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly
   northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation
   of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and
   geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape
   context.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Gammarus minus is an important component of surface spring and cave
   ecosystems throughout Appalachia, and is a useful indicator of the
   hydrology and gene flow in freshwater communities. Gammarus minus
   populations occupying large cave passages (> 2 km) are usually
   troglomorphic, having reduced eyes, fewer ommatidia, larger body size,
   longer antennae, and reduced pigmentation relative to surface
   populations. We surveyed five cave stream and 10 surface spring
   populations for DNA sequence variation in the cytochrome c oxidase I
   (COI) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) genes with an aim
   towards characterizing phylogeographical structure and comparing the
   nature of genetic variation in cave vs. surface populations. Although
   standing variation at both loci was rather low within populations, a
   significant degree of divergence and spatial structuring of populations
   was observed. Levels of genetic variation within cave and spring
   populations differed substantially, with caves harbouring significantly
   less variation at the COI locus than surface springs. Codon usage bias
   was significantly lower in caves, indicating that cave streams harbour
   smaller and/or more recently colonized populations. Overall these data
   indicate limited gene flow among populations and suggest that the cave
   populations sampled in this study are prone to bottlenecks, possibly due
   to larger temperature fluctuations and more frequent incidence of
   drought conditions associated with these particular cave habitats.}},

   closely related taxa, three of which are widely distributed and differ
   in their host trees, whereas a fourth taxon is rare and endemic to the
   Island of Crete. The molecular analysis of chloroplast DNA variation
   supported the distinction of these four taxa. We further found evidence
   for phylogeographical structure in each of the three widely distributed
   host races. Independent of host race, mistletoe haplotypes from Turkey
   were distinct and distant from those found elsewhere in Europe,

Abstract = {{The brown bear has proved a useful model for studying Late Quaternary
   mammalian phylogeography. However, information is lacking from northern
   continental Eurasia, which constitutes a large part of the species'
   current distribution. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences (totalling
   1943 bp) from 205 bears from northeast Europe and Russia in order to
   characterize the maternal phylogeography of bears in this region. We
   also estimated the formation times of the sampled brown bear lineages
   and those of its extinct relative, the cave bear.
   Four closely related haplogroups belonging to a single mitochondrial
   subclade were identified in northern continental Eurasia. Several
   haplotypes were found throughout the whole study area, while one
   haplogroup was restricted to Kamchatka. The haplotype network, estimated
   divergence times and various statistical tests indicated that bears in
   northern continental Eurasia recently underwent a sudden expansion,
   preceded by a severe bottleneck. This brown bear population was
   therefore most likely founded by a small number of bears that were
   restricted to a single refuge area during the last glacial maximum. This
   pattern has been described previously for other mammal species and as
   such may represent one general model for the phylogeography of Eurasian
   mammals. Bayesian divergence time estimates are presented for different
   brown and cave bear clades. Moreover, our results demonstrate the extent
   of substitution rate variation occurring throughout the phylogenetic
   tree, highlighting the need for appropriate calibration when estimating
   divergence times.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor (Polychaeta:
   Nereididae) revealed a marked genetic fragmentation across its
   distribution and the occurrence of sibling taxa in the Baltic Sea. These
   results suggested that the phylogeographic patterns of H. diversicolor
   could reflect interactions between cryptic differentiation and multiple
   colonization events. This study aims to describe the large-scale genetic
   structuring of H. diversicolor and to trace the phylogeographic origins
   of the genetic types described in the Baltic Sea. Samples of H.
   diversicolor (2 < n < 28) were collected at 16 locations across the NE
   Atlantic coasts of Europe and Morocco and in the Mediterranean, Black
   and Caspian Seas and sequenced at two mitochondrial gene fragments (COI
   and cytb, 345 and 290 bp, respectively). Bayesian analyses revealed deep
   phylogeographic splits yielding three main clades corresponding to
   populations (i) from the NE Atlantic coasts (from Germany to Morocco)
   and from part of the Western Mediterranean, (ii) from the Mediterranean
   Sea, and (iii) from the Black and Caspian Seas. These clades are further
   divided in well-supported subclades including populations from different
   regions of NE Atlantic and Mediterranean (i.e. Portugal/Morocco, Western
   Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea). The Baltic Sea comprises three sympatric
   lineages sharing a common evolutionary history with populations from NE
   Atlantic, Western Mediterranean and Black/Caspian Seas, respectively.
   Hence, the current patterns of genetic structuring of H. diversicolor
   appear as the result of allopatric isolation, multiple colonization
   events and possible adaptation to local environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the biological significance of Pleistocene glaciations
   requires knowledge of the nature and extent of habitat refugia during
   glacial maxima. An opportunity to examine evidence of glacial forest
   refugia in a maritime, Southern Hemisphere setting is found in New
   Zealand, where the extent of Pleistocene forests remains controversial.
   We used the mitochondrial phylogeography of a forest-edge cicada
   (Kikihia subalpina) to test the hypothesis that populations of this
   species survived throughout South Island during the Last Glacial
   Maximum. We also compared mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic patterns
   with male song patterns that suggest allopatric divergence across Cook
   Strait. Cytochrome oxidase I and II sequences were analyzed using
   network analysis, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic estimation, Bayesian
   dating and Bayesian skyline plots. K. subalpina haplotypes from North
   Island and South Island form monophyletic clades that are concordant
   with song patterns. Song divergence corresponds to approximately 2\%
   genetic divergence, and Bayesian dating suggests that the North Island
   and South Island population-lineages became isolated around 761 000
   years bp. Almost all South Island genetic variation is found in the
   north of the island, consistent with refugia in Marlborough Sounds,
   central Nelson and northwest Nelson. All central and southern South
   Island and Stewart Island haplotypes are extremely similar to northern
   South Island haplotypes, a `northern richness/southern purity' pattern
   that mirrors genetic patterns observed in many Northern Hemisphere taxa.
   Proposed southern South Island forest habitat fragments may have been
   too small to sustain populations of K. subalpina, and/or they may have
   harboured ecological communities with no modern-day analogues.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2010-2021}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of extra-pair paternity have found support for the idea
   that heterozygous males have an advantage in siring offspring. Most
   studies use DNA microsatellite loci to determine paternity and then use
   the same loci to estimate individual heterozygosity. However, because
   the likelihood of detecting extra-pair offspring depends on the
   combinations of parental alleles, it is possible that biases arise from
   particular allele combinations. This might produce false support for the
   influence of heterozygosity on mating behaviour. We used a simulation
   model to assess how large this bias might be. We found two sources of
   bias. First, we found a bias in the null hypothesis of a simple
   statistical test commonly used to test several predictions of the
   heterozygosity hypothesis. The use of randomization tests could
   eliminate this bias. Second, we found that using the same loci for both
   paternity and heterozygosity can cause an increase in results supporting
   the heterozygosity hypothesis when no effect of heterozygosity actually
   exists. This bias is reduced through the use of more markers with higher
   levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity, but can be eliminated
   entirely by using a separate set of markers to determine paternity and
   assess heterozygosity. The two sources of bias reduce evidence favouring
   the heterozygosity hypothesis, but do not negate all of the studies that
   support it. We suggest that further studies of heterozygosity and
   extra-pair paternity are important and likely to be informative, but our
   recommendations should be incorporated by researchers to improve the
   reliability of their conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-based techniques have proven useful for defining trophic links in a
   variety of ecosystems and recently developed sequencing technologies
   provide new opportunities for dietary studies. We investigated the diet
   of Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) by
   pyrosequencing prey DNA from faeces collected at three breeding colonies
   across the seals' range. DNA from 270 faecal samples was amplified with
   four polymerase chain reaction primer sets and a blocking primer was
   used to limit amplification of fur seal DNA. Pooled amplicons from each
   colony were sequenced using the Roche GS-FLX platform, generating > 20
   000 sequences. Software was developed to sort and group similar
   sequences. A total of 54 bony fish, 4 cartilaginous fish and 4
   cephalopods were identified based on the most taxonomically informative
   amplicons sequenced (mitochondrial 16S). The prevalence of sequences
   from redbait (Emmelichthys nitidus) and jack mackerel (Trachurus
   declivis) confirm the importance of these species in the seals' diet. A
   third fish species, blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus), may be a more
   important prey species than previously recognised. There were major
   differences in the proportions of prey DNA recovered in faeces from
   different colonies, probably reflecting differences in prey
   availability. Parallel hard-part analysis identified largely the same
   main prey species as did the DNA-based technique, but with lower species
   diversity and no remains from cartilaginous prey. The pyrosequencing
   approach presented significantly expands the capabilities of DNA-based
   methods of dietary analysis and is suitable for large-scale diet
   investigations on a broad range of animals.}},

Abstract = {{The role of standing genetic variation in adaptive evolution remains
   unclear. Although there has been much progress in identifying candidate
   genes that underlie adaptive traits, we still lack direct evidence that
   natural allelic variation in these genes can actually mediate adaptive
   evolution. In this study, we investigate the role of natural allelic
   variation in two candidate flowering time genes, in response to
   selection for early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana: FRIGIDA (FRI) and
   FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We performed artificial selection for early
   flowering under `spring-' and `winter-annual' growth conditions using an
   outbred population of A. thaliana produced by intermating 19 natural
   accessions. FRI and FLC are involved in A. thaliana's response to winter
   conditions, and nonfunctional and weak alleles at these loci are know to
   reduce flowering time, particularly under spring-annual conditions. Our
   results provide direct evidence that natural allelic variation in FRI
   can provide rapid and predictable adaptive evolution in flowering time
   under spring-annual conditions. We observed a strong response to
   selection, in terms of reducing flowering time, in both growth
   conditions (similar to 2 standard deviation reduction). Concomitantly,
   the frequency of functional FRI alleles under spring-annual conditions
   was reduced by 68\%, in agreement with predicted changes. No significant
   changes in allele frequencies were observed in FRI in the winter-annual
   growth condition or in FLC for either growth conditions. These results
   indicate that changes in flowering time are mediated by different
   genetic factors under spring- and winter-annual growth conditions, and
   that other loci must also be contributing to the response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Pollution by heavy metals is one of the strongest environmental
   constraints in human-altered environments that only a handful of species
   can cope with. Identifying the genes conferring to those species the
   ability to grow in polluted areas is a first step towards a global
   understanding of the evolutionary processes involved and will eventually
   improve phytoremediation practices. We used a genome-scan approach to
   detect loci under divergent selection among four populations of
   Arabidopsis halleri growing on either polluted or nonpolluted habitats.
   Based on a high density of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   markers (820 AFLP markers, i.e. similar to 1 marker per 0.3 Mb),
   evidence for selection was found for some markers in every sampled
   population. Four loci departed from neutrality in both metallicolous
   populations and thus constitute high-quality candidates for general
   adaptation to pollution. Interestingly, some candidates differed between
   the two metallicolous populations, suggesting the possibility that
   different loci may be involved in adaptation in the different
   metallicolous populations.}},

Abstract = {{`Evolution Canyon' (ECI) at Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel, is
   an optimal natural microscale model for unravelling evolution in action
   highlighting the twin evolutionary processes of adaptation and
   speciation. A major model organism in ECI is wild barley, Hordeum
   spontaneum, the progenitor of cultivated barley, which displays dramatic
   interslope adaptive and speciational divergence on the `African' dry
   slope (AS) and the `European' humid slope (ES), separated on average by
   200 m. Here we examined interslope single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
   sequences and the expression diversity of the drought resistant dehydrin
   1 gene (Dhn1) between the opposite slopes. We analysed 47 plants
   (genotypes), 4-10 individuals in each of seven stations (populations) in
   an area of 7000 m(2), for Dhn1 sequence diversity located in the 5'
   upstream flanking region of the gene. We found significant levels of
   Dhn1 genic diversity represented by 29 haplotypes, derived from 45 SNPs
   in a total of 708 bp sites. Most of the haplotypes, 25 out of 29 (=
   86.2\%), were represented by one genotype; hence, unique to one
   population. Only a single haplotype was common to both slopes. Genetic
   divergence of sequence and haplotype diversity was generally and
   significantly different among the populations and slopes. Nucleotide
   diversity was higher on the AS, whereas haplotype diversity was higher
   on the ES. Interslope divergence was significantly higher than
   intraslope divergence. The applied Tajima D rejected neutrality of the
   SNP diversity. The Dhn1 expression under dehydration indicated
   interslope divergent expression between AS and ES genotypes, reinforcing
   Dhn1 associated with drought resistance of wild barley at `Evolution
   Canyon'. These results are inexplicable by mutation, gene flow, or
   chance effects, and support adaptive natural microclimatic selection as
   the major evolutionary divergent driving force.}},

Abstract = {{Gene exchange among oak species (Quercus) in Europe is known to be
   pervasive and to complicate population genetic studies of this species
   complex. A study in this issue of Molecular Ecology adds geographical
   and stand-level resolution to the patterns of genetic variation among
   four species and documents the relatively high frequency of hybrids
   (10.7-30.5\% of trees in a population, including hybrids between all
   pairs of species; Lepais et al. 2009). In addition, the authors show
   that the relative abundance of parental species affects the genetic
   composition of hybrids and shifts the average direction of
   introgression. Variation in the relative abundance of parental species
   is one example of how the ecological context of hybridization can
   influence the dynamics and outcome of contact between species and
   represents an opportunity to investigate the components of reproductive
   isolation between species. This research raises several questions about
   the dynamics of hybridization in this well-studied species complex, and
   highlights methodological and conceptual issues associated with
   contemporary research on hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed colony- and island-level genetic differentiation for the
   flightless cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi), an endangered Galapagos
   endemic that has one of the most limited geographical distributions of
   any seabird, consisting of only two adjacent islands. We screened 223
   individuals from both islands and nine colonies at five microsatellite
   loci, recovering 23 alleles. We found highly significant genetic
   differentiation throughout the flightless cormorant's range on
   Fernandina and Isabela Islands (global F(ST) = 0.097; P < 0.0003) both
   between islands (supported by Bayesian analyses, F(ST) and R(ST) values)
   and within islands (supported only by F(ST) and R(ST) values). An
   overall pattern of isolation-by-distance was evident throughout the
   sampled range (r = 0.4169, one-sided P <= 0.02) and partial Mantel tests
   of this relationship confirmed that ocean is a dispersal barrier (r =
   0.500, one-sided P <= 0.003), especially across the 5-km gap between the
   two islands. The degree of detected genetic differentiation among
   colonies is surprising, given the flightless cormorant's limited range,
   and suggests a role for low vagility, behavioural philopatry, or both to
   limit dispersal where physical barriers are absent. We argue that this
   population should be managed as at least two genetic populations to
   better preserve the species-level genetic diversity, but, for
   demographic reasons, advocate the continued conservation of all breeding
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{We sequenced a portion (c. 475 bp) of the mitochondrial control region

   Leptonychotes weddellii, N = 181; crabeater seal, Lobodon carcinophaga,
   N = 143; and Ross seal, Ommatophoca rossii, N = 41) that live seasonally
   or permanently in the fast ice and seasonal pack ice of the western
   Amundsen and Ross seas of western Antarctica. We resolved 251 haplotypes
   with a haplotype diversity of 0.98 to 0.99. Bayesian estimates of Theta
   from the program LAMARC ranged from 0.075 for Weddell seals to 0.576 for
   crabeater seals. We used the values of theta to estimate female
   effective population sizes (N(EF)), which were 40 700 to 63 000 for
   Weddell seals, 44 400 to 97 800 for Ross seals, and 358 500 to 531 900
   for crabeater seals. We used mismatch distributions to test for
   historical population size expansions. Weddell seals and crabeater seals
   had significant, unimodal mean pairwise difference distributions (P =
   0.56 and 0.36, respectively), suggesting that their populations expanded
   suddenly around 731 000 years ago (Weddell seals) and around 1.6 million
   years ago (crabeater seals). Both of these expansions occurred during
   times of intensified glaciations and may have been fostered by expanding
   pack ice habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Genotypic or phenotypic markers for characterization of natural
   populations of marine microalgae have typically addressed questions
   regarding differentiation among populations, usually with reference to a
   single or few clonal isolates. Based upon a large number of
   contemporaneous isolates from the same geographical population of the
   toxigenic species Alexandrium tamarense from the North Sea, we uncovered
   significant genetic substructure and low but significant multilocus
   linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the planktonic population. Between
   the alternative molecular genotyping approaches, only amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) revealed cryptic genetic population
   substructure by Bayesian clustering, whereas microsatellite markers
   failed to yield concordant patterns. Both markers, however, gave
   evidence for genetic differentiation of population subgroups as defined
   by AFLP. A considerable portion of multilocus LD could be attributed to
   population subdivision. The remaining LD within population subgroups is
   interpreted as an indicator of frequency shifts of clonal lineages
   during vegetative growth of planktonic populations. Phenotypic
   characters such as cellular content and composition of neurotoxins
   associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) and allelochemical
   properties may contribute to intra- or inter-annual differentiation of
   planktonic populations, if clonal lineages that express these characters
   are selectively favoured. Nevertheless, significant phenotypic
   differentiation for these characters among the genetically
   differentiated subgroups was only detected for PSP toxin content in two
   of the four population subgroups. By integrating the analysis of
   phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, we developed a conceptual
   population genetic model to explain the importance of life-cycle
   dynamics and transitions in the evolutionary ecology of these
   dinoflagellates.}},

Abstract = {{Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite of significant public health
   importance in parts of China and Southeast Asia, is a true generalist
   pathogen with over 40 species of mammals suspected as definitive host
   reservoirs. In order to characterize levels of parasite gene flow across
   host species and identify the most important zoonotic reservoirs, S.
   japonicum larvae (miracidia) were sampled from a range of definitive
   host species in two contrasting habitat types within Anhui Province,
   China: a low-lying marshland region, and a hilly region, where animal
   reservoir populations may be predicted to differ substantially.
   Miracidia samples were genotyped using seven multiplexed microsatellite
   markers. Hierarchical F-statistics and clustering analyses revealed
   substantial geographical structuring of S. japonicum populations within
   Anhui, with strong parasite genetic differentiation between habitat
   types. Within most villages, there was very little or no parasite
   genetic differentiation among host species, suggesting frequent S.
   japonicum gene flow, and thus also transmission, across species.
   Moreover, the data provide novel molecular evidence that rodents and
   dogs are potentially very important infection reservoirs in hilly
   regions, in contrast to bovines in the marshland regions. The parasite
   genetic differentiation between habitat types might therefore be
   associated with contrasting host reservoirs. The high levels of parasite
   gene flow observed across host species in sympatric areas have important
   implications for S. japonicum control, particularly in hilly regions
   where control of infection among wild rodent populations could be
   challenging.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Equations for the effective size (N(e)) of a population were derived in
   terms of the frequencies of a pair of offspring taken at random from the
   population being sibs sharing the same one or two parents. Based on
   these equations, a novel method (called sibship assignment method) was
   proposed to infer Ne from the sibship frequencies estimated from a
   sibship assignment analysis, using the multilocus genotypes of a sample
   of offspring taken at random from a single cohort in a population.
   Comparative analyses of extensive simulated data and some empirical data
   clearly demonstrated that the sibship assignment method is much more
   accurate {[}measured by the root mean squared error, RMSE, of 1/(2N(e))]
   than other methods such as the heterozygote excess method, the linkage
   disequilibrium method, and the temporal method. The RMSE of 1/(2N(e))
   from the sibship assignment method is typically a small fraction of that
   from other methods. The new method is also more general and flexible
   than other methods. It can be applied to populations with nonoverlapping
   generations of both diploid and haplodiploid species under random or
   nonrandom mating, using either codominant or dominant markers. It can
   also be applied to the estimation of N(e) for a subpopulation with
   immigration. With some modification, it could be applied to monoecious
   diploid populations with self-fertilization, and to populations with
   overlapping generations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of development mode on the spatial and
   temporal population genetic structure of four littorinid gastropod
   species. Snails were collected from the same three sites on the west
   coast of Vancouver Island, Canada in 1997 and again in 2007. DNA
   sequences were obtained for one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b (Cyt
   b), and for up to two nuclear genes, heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and
   aminopeptidase N intron (APN54). We found that the mean level of genetic
   diversity and long-term effective population sizes (N(e)) were
   significantly greater for two species, Littorina scutulata and L. plena,
   that had a planktotrophic larval stage than for two species, Littorina
   sitkana and L. subrotundata, that laid benthic egg masses which hatched
   directly into crawl-away juveniles. Predictably, two poorly dispersing
   species, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata, showed significant spatial
   genetic structure at an 11- to 65-km geographical scale that was not
   observed in the two planktotrophic species. Conversely, the two
   planktotrophic species had more temporal genetic structure over a
   10-year interval than did the two direct-developing species and showed
   highly significant temporal structure for spatially pooled samples. The
   greater temporal genetic variation of the two planktotrophic species may
   have been caused by their high fecundity, high larval dispersal, and low
   but spatially correlated early survivorship. The sweepstakes-like
   reproductive success of the planktotrophic species could allow a few
   related females to populate hundreds of kilometres of coastline and may
   explain their substantially larger temporal genetic variance but lower
   spatial genetic variance relative to the direct-developing species.}},

Abstract = {{Lowland tropical habitats harbour an unexplored genetic diversity of
   epiphyllous fungi. In the shade of rainforest understoreys, lichenized
   fungi are specialized to an ephemeral habitat where they produce little
   vegetative biomass and develop reproductive structures early. In a first
   population genetic study of epiphyllous lichen fungi, we analysed the
   intraspecific genetic diversity of five leaf-colonizing lichen mycobiont
   species. Sampling focused on a lowland perhumid forest plot in Costa
   Rica, with additional collections from other localities throughout the
   country. In all species we detected sympatric occurrence of highly
   diverged haplotypes. Haplotypes belonging to distinct clades in networks
   were also found on the same leaf, clearly indicating multiple
   independent colonization events on single leaves. Despite the unusually
   high genetic diversity of these leaf-colonizing tropical fungi, we did
   not detect pronounced spatial structure of the haplotype distribution
   between geographical regions. The observed patterns suggest that the
   diversity of foliicolous lichens could be much higher than expected,
   with several cryptic genetic lineages within each morphologically
   characterized species.}},

Abstract = {{Many plant-feeding insect species considered to be polyphagous are in
   fact composed of genetically differentiated sympatric populations that
   use different hosts and between which gene flow still exists. We studied
   the population genetic structure of the cotton-melon aphid Aphis

   species. We used eight microsatellites to analyse the genetic diversity
   of numerous samples of A. gossypii collected over several years at a
   large geographical scale on annual crops from different plant families.
   The number of multilocus genotypes detected was extremely low and the
   genotypes were found to be associated with host plants. Five host races
   were unambiguously identified (Cucurbitaceae, cotton, eggplant, potato
   and chili- or sweet pepper). These host races were dominated by asexual
   clones. Plant transfer experiments using several specialized clones
   further confirmed the existence of host-associated trade-offs. Finally,
   both genetic and experimental data suggested that plants of the genus
   Hibiscus may be used as refuge for the specialized clones. Resource
   abundance is discussed as a key factor involved in the process of
   ecological specialization in A. gossypii.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the critical roles fungi play in the functioning of ecosystems,
   especially as symbionts of plants and recyclers of organic matter, their
   biodiversity is poorly known in high-latitude regions. In this paper, we
   discuss the molecular diversity of one of the most diverse and abundant
   groups of ectomycorrhizal fungi: the genus Lactarius Pers. We analysed
   internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequences from both curated sporocarp
   collections and soil polymerase chain reaction clone libraries sampled
   in the arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska. Our genetic diversity
   assessment, based on various phylogenetic methods and operational
   taxonomic unit (OTU) delimitations, suggests that the genus Lactarius is
   diverse in Alaska, with at least 43 putative phylogroups, and 24 and 38
   distinct OTUs based on 95\% and 97\% internal transcribed spacer
   sequence similarity, respectively. Some OTUs were identified to known
   species, while others were novel, previously unsequenced groups.
   Non-asymptotic species accumulation curves, the disparity between
   observed and estimated richness, and the high number of singleton OTUs
   indicated that many Lactarius species remain to be found and identified
   in Alaska. Many Lactarius taxa show strong habitat preference to one of
   the three major vegetation types in the sampled regions (arctic tundra,
   black spruce forests, and mixed birch-aspen-white spruce forests), as
   supported by statistical tests of UniFrac distances and principal
   coordinates analyses (PCoA). Together, our data robustly demonstrate

Abstract = {{Successful hybridisation and subsequent introgression lead to the
   transfer of genetic material across species boundaries. In this process,
   species relative abundance can play a significant role. If one species
   is less abundant than the other, its females will receive many
   heterospecific gametes, increasing mate-recognition errors and thus
   hybridisation rate. Moreover, first-generation hybrids will also more
   likely mate with the more abundant species, leading to asymmetric
   introgression. These predictions have important fundamental
   consequences, especially during biological invasions or when a rare
   species threatened by extinction is surrounded by individuals from a
   related species. However, experimental tests in nature of the importance
   of the relative abundance of each species on hybridisation dynamics
   remain scarce. We assess here the impact of species relative abundance
   on hybridisation dynamics among four species from the European white oak
   species complex. A total of 2107 oak trees were genotyped at 10
   microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering methods were used to
   identify reference trees of each species. We then used these reference
   trees to simulate purebred and hybrid genotypes to determine optimal
   threshold for genetic assignment. With this approach, we found
   widespread evidence of hybridisation between all studied oak species,
   with high occurrence of hybrids, varying from 11\% to 31\% according to
   stand and sampling strategies. This finding suggests that hybridisation
   is a common phenomenon that plays a significant role in evolution of
   this oak species complex. In addition, we demonstrate a strong impact of
   species abundance on both hybridisation rate and introgression
   directionality.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic changes associated with Pleistocene glacial cycles profoundly
   affected species distributions, patterns of interpopulation gene flow,
   and demography. In species restricted to montane habitats, ranges may
   expand and contract along an elevational gradients in response to
   environmental fluctuations and create high levels of genetic variation
   among populations on different mountains. The salamander Plethodon
   fourchensis is restricted to high-elevation, mesic forest on five
   montane isolates in the Ouachita Mountains. We used DNA sequence data
   along with ecological niche modelling and coalescent simulations to test
   several hypotheses related to the effects of Pleistocene climatic
   fluctuations on species in montane habitats. Our results revealed that
   P. fourchensis is composed of four well-supported, geographically
   structured lineages. Geographic breaks between lineages occurred in the
   vicinity of major valleys and a narrow high-elevation pass. Ecological
   niche modelling predicted that environmental conditions in valleys
   separating most mountains are suitable; however, interglacial periods
   like the present are predicted to be times of range expansion in P.
   fourchensis. Divergence dating and coalescent simulations indicated that
   lineage diversification occurred during the Middle Pleistocene via the
   fragmentation of a wide-ranging ancestor. Bayesian skyline plots showed
   gradual decreases in population size in three of four lineages over the
   most recent glacial period and a slight to moderate amount of population
   growth during the Holocene. Our results not only demonstrate that
   climatic changes during the Pleistocene had profound effects on species
   restricted to montane habitats, but comparison of our results for P.
   fourchensis with its parapatric, sister taxon, P. ouachitae, also
   emphasizes how responses can vary substantially even among closely
   related, similarly distributed taxa.}},

Abstract = {{We reconstructed the evolutionary history of Codia, a plant genus
   endemic to the New Caledonia biodiversity hotspot in the southwest
   Pacific, using three single-copy nuclear genes. It seems likely that
   more than half of Codia species have a hybrid origin, but in the absence
   of cytological information, it is not known whether polyploids occur.
   Adaptation to ultramafic soils is possibly a plesiomorphic character for
   the entire genus. We found that species of hybrid origin can have some
   morphological characters absent in putative parental species, that is,
   they exhibit transgressive phenotypes. There is evidence of considerable
   range alteration post-origin in several species because some likely
   parental species of hybrid taxa no longer co-occur and are confined to
   putative rainforest refugia; in some cases, hybrid species do not now
   co-occur with either of their parental species. These results have
   implications for the design of conservation strategies, for example,
   prioritization of parental species for ex-situ conservation and
   preservation of the contact zones between soil types where hybridization
   is more likely to occur (i.e. conserving the possibility for the process
   to continue rather than trying to conserve taxa).}},

Abstract = {{This study represents the first large-scale analysis using nuclear
   molecular markers to assess genetic diversity and structure of Cupressus
   sempervirens L.. Genetic and fossil data were combined to infer the
   possible role of human activity and evolutionary history in shaping the
   diversity of cypress populations. We analysed 30 populations with six
   polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. Dramatic reductions in
   heterozygosity and allelic richness were observed from east to west
   across the species range. Structure analysis assigned individuals to two
   main groups separating central Mediterranean and eastern populations.
   The two main groups could be further divided into five subgroups which
   showed the following geographical distributions: Turkey with the Greek
   islands Rhodes and Samos, Greece (Crete), Southern Italy, Northern
   Italy, Tunisia with Central Italy. This pattern of genetic structure is
   also supported by samova and Barrier analyses. Palaeobotanical data
   indicated that Cupressus was present in Italy in the Pliocene,
   Pleistocene and Holocene. Furthermore, our molecular survey showed that
   Italian cypress populations experienced bottlenecks that resulted in
   reduced genetic diversity and allelic richness and greater genetic
   differentiation. Recent colonization or introduction may also have
   influenced levels of diversity detected in the Italian populations, as
   most individuals found in this range today have multilocus genotypes
   that are also present in the eastern range of the species. The data
   reveal a new interpretation of the history of cypress distribution
   characterized by ancient eastern populations (Turkey and Greek islands)
   and a mosaic of recently introduced trees and remnants of ancient,
   depauperate populations in the central Mediterranean range.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary effects of Southern Hemisphere Pleistocene
   oceanographic conditions - marked by fluctuations in sea levels and
   water temperatures, and redirected currents - are poorly understood. The
   southeastern tip of Australia presents an intriguing model system for
   studying the biological impacts of palaeoceanography. In particular,
   contrasting oceanographic conditions that existed on eastern vs. western
   sides of the Bassian Isthmus during Pleistocene glacial periods allow
   for natural comparisons between putative refugial vs. re-invading
   populations. Whereas many western Tasmanian marine taxa were likely
   eliminated by cold subantarctic water during the last glacial period,
   eastern Tasmanian populations would have persisted in relatively warm
   temperatures mediated by the ongoing influence of the East Australian
   Current (EAC). Here we test for the effects of contrasting
   palaeoceanographic conditions on endemic bull kelp, Durvillaea
   potatorum, using DNA sequence analysis (COI; rbcL) of more than 100
   individuals from 14 localities in southeastern Australia. Phylogenetic
   reconstructions reveal a deep (maximum divergence 4.7\%) genetic split
   within D. potatorum, corresponding to the `eastern' and `western'
   geographical regions delimited by the Bassian Isthmus, a vicariant
   barrier during low Pleistocene sea levels. Concordant with the western
   region's cold glacial conditions, samples from western Tasmania and
   western Victoria are genetically monomorphic, suggesting postglacial
   expansion from a mainland refugium. Eastern samples, in contrast,
   comprise distinct regional haplogroups, suggesting the species persisted
   in eastern Tasmania throughout recent glacial periods. The deep
   east-west divergence seems consistent with earlier reports of
   morphological differences between `western' and `eastern' D. potatorum,
   and it seems likely that these forms represent reproductively isolated
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Matings between relatives lead to a decrease in offspring genetic
   diversity which can reduce fitness, a phenomenon known as inbreeding
   depression. Because alpine ungulates generally live in small structured
   populations and often exhibit a polygynous mating system, they are
   susceptible to inbreeding. Here, we used marker-based measures of
   pairwise genetic relatedness and inbreeding to investigate the fitness
   consequences of matings between relatives in a long-term study
   population of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) at Caw Ridge,
   Alberta, Canada. We first assessed whether individuals avoided mating
   with kin by comparing actual and random mating pairs according to their
   estimated genetic relatedness, which was derived from 25 unlinked
   polymorphic microsatellite markers and reflected pedigree relatedness.
   We then examined whether individual multilocus heterozygosity H, used as
   a measure of inbreeding, was predicted by parental relatedness and
   associated with yearling survival and the annual probability of giving
   birth to a kid in adult females. Breeding pairs identified by genetic
   parentage analyses of offspring that survived to 1 year of age were less
   genetically related than expected under random matings. Parental
   relatedness was negatively correlated with offspring H, and more
   heterozygous yearlings had higher survival to 2 years of age. The
   probability of giving birth was not affected by H in adult females.
   Because kids that survived to yearling age were mainly produced by less
   genetically related parents, our results suggest that some individuals
   experienced inbreeding depression in early life. Future research will be
   required to quantify the levels of gene flow between different herds,
   and evaluate their effects on population genetic diversity and dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic analyses of realized reproductive success have fundamentally
   changed our understanding of mating behaviour in natural systems. While
   behavioural ecologists have long been interested in what factors
   influence mating behaviour, early studies were limited to direct
   observations of matings and thus provided an incomplete picture of
   reproductive activity. Genetic assessments of parentage have
   revolutionized the study of reproductive behaviour, revealing that many
   individuals engage in extra-pair copulations (Griffith et al. 2002) and
   that social mating partners frequently invest substantial resources into
   raising offspring that are unrelated to one or both of them (Avise et
   al. 2002). While these findings have changed the way we think about
   reproductive behaviour, most investigations of genetic parentage have
   been restricted to single populations at a single point in time,
   obscuring spatial and/or temporal variation in mating behaviour and
   limiting our ability to determine how environmental changes can lead to
   shifts in mating strategies. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Mobley
   \& Jones (2009) compare genetic mating behaviour across five populations
   of Syngnathus floridae ( Fig. 1), a widespread species of pipefish
   distributed along the Gulf- and Atlantic Coasts of North America. The
   authors document how genetic mating behaviour varies across space in S.
   floridae and identify correlations between reproductive variation and
   particular ecological characteristics. Mobley \& Jones' paper is one of
   an increasing number of studies which address the question of how
   ecological variables influence mating behaviour, and highlights how our
   understanding of mating system variation and evolution is likely to
   expand through the wider application of high-throughput parentage
   assessment in a comparative context.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary history of a population involves changes in size,
   movements and selection pressures through time. Reconstruction of
   population history based on modern genetic data tends to be averaged
   over time or to be biased by generally reflecting only recent or extreme
   events, leaving many population historic processes undetected. Temporal
   genetic data present opportunities to reveal more complex population
   histories and provide important insights into what processes have
   influenced modern genetic diversity. Here we provide a synopsis of
   methods available for the analysis of ancient genetic data. We review 29
   ancient DNA studies, summarizing the analytical methods and general
   conclusions for each study. Using the serial coalescent and a
   model-testing approach, we then re-analyse data from two species
   represented by these data sets in a common interpretive framework. Our
   analyses show that phylochronologic data can reveal more about
   population history than modern data alone, thus revealing `cryptic'
   population processes, and enable us to determine whether simple or
   complex models best explain the data. Our re-analyses point to the need
   for novel methods that consider gene flow, multiple populations and
   population size in reconstruction of population history. We conclude
   that population genetic samples over large temporal and geographical
   scales, when analysed using more complex models and the serial
   coalescent, are critical to understand past population dynamics and
   provide important tools for reconstructing the evolutionary process.}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most
   polymorphic loci known in vertebrates. Two main hypotheses have been put
   forward to explain the maintenance of MHC diversity: pathogen-mediated
   selection and MHC-based mate choice. Host-parasite interactions can
   maintain MHC diversity via frequency-dependent selection, heterozygote
   advantage, and diversifying selection (spatially and/or temporally
   heterogeneous selection). In this study, we wished to investigate the
   nature of selection acting on the MHC class I across spatially
   structured populations of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in France.
   To infer the nature of the selection, we compared patterns of population
   differentiation based on two types of molecular markers: MHC class I and
   microsatellites. This allowed us to test whether the observed
   differentiation at MHC genes merely reflects demographic and/or
   stochastic processes. At the global scale, diversifying selection seems
   to be the main factor maintaining MHC diversity in the house sparrow. We
   found that (i) overall population differentiation at MHC was stronger
   than for microsatellites, (ii) MHC marker showed significant isolation
   by distance. In addition, the slope of the regression of F(ST) on
   geographical distance was significantly steeper for MHC than for
   microsatellites due to a stronger pairwise differentiation between
   populations located at large geographical distances. These results are
   in agreement with the hypothesis that spatially heterogeneous selective
   pressures maintain different MHC alleles at local scales, possibly
   resulting in local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The Scandinavian wolf population represents one of the genetically most
   well-characterized examples of a severely bottlenecked natural
   population (with only two founders), and of how the addition of new
   genetic material (one immigrant) can at least temporarily provide a
   `genetic rescue'. However, inbreeding depression has been observed in
   this population and in the absence of additional immigrants, its
   long-term viability is questioned. To study the effects of inbreeding
   and selection on genomic diversity, we performed a genomic scan with
   approximately 250 microsatellite markers distributed across all
   autosomes and the X chromosome. We found linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   that extended up to distances of 50 Mb, exceeding that of most
   outbreeding species studied thus far. LD was particularly pronounced on
   the X chromosome. Overall levels of observed genomic heterozygosity did
   not deviate significantly from simulations based on known population
   history, giving no support for a general selection for heterozygotes.
   However, we found evidence supporting balancing selection at a number of
   loci and also evidence suggesting directional selection at other loci.
   For markers on chromosome 23, the signal of selection was particularly
   strong, indicating that purifying selection against deleterious alleles
   may have occurred even in this very small population. These data suggest
   that population genomics allows the exploration of the effects of
   neutral and non-neutral evolution on a finer scale than what has
   previously been possible.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between pedigree coefficients of inbreeding and molecular
   metrics are generally weak, suggesting that measures of heterozygosity
   estimated using microsatellites may be poor surrogates of genome-wide
   inbreeding. We compare three endangered species of gazelles (Gazella)
   with different degrees of threat in their natural habitats, for which
   captive breeding programmes exist. For G. dorcas, the species with the
   largest founding population, the highest and most recent number of
   founding events, the correlation between pedigree coefficient of
   inbreeding and molecular metrics was higher than for outbred populations
   of mammals, probably because it has both higher mean f and variance. For
   the two species with smaller founding populations, conventional
   assumptions about founders, i.e. outbred and unrelated, are unrealistic.
   When realistic assumptions about the founders were made, clear
   relationships between pedigree coefficients of inbreeding and molecular
   metrics were revealed for G. cuvieri. This population had a small
   founding population, but it did experience admixture years later; thus,
   the relationship between inbreeding and molecular metrics in G. cuvieri
   is very similar to the expected values but lower than in G. dorcas. In
   contrast, no relationship was found for G. dama mhorr which had a much
   smaller founding population than had been previously assumed, which
   probably had high levels of inbreeding and low levels of genetic
   variability, and no admixture. In conclusion, the strength of the
   association between pedigree coefficient of inbreeding and molecular
   metrics among endangered species depends on the level of inbreeding and
   genetic variability present in the founding population, its size and its
   history.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of landscape genetics is to understand how landscapes
   structure genetic variation in natural populations. However, landscape
   genetics still lacks a framework for quantifying the effects of
   landscape features, such as habitat type, on realized gene flow. Here,
   we present a methodology for identifying the costs of dispersal through
   different habitats for the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma
   californiense), an endangered species restricted to grassland/vernal
   pool habitat mosaics. We sampled larvae from all 16 breeding ponds in a
   geographically restricted area of vernal pool habitat at the Fort Ord
   Natural Reserve, Monterey County, California. We estimated between-pond
   gene flow using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci and constructed GIS
   data layers of habitat types in our study area. We then used least-cost
   path analysis to determine the relative costs of movement through each
   habitat that best match rates of gene flow measured by our genetic data.
   We identified four measurable rates of gene flow between pairs of ponds,
   with between 10.5\% and 19.9\% of larvae having immigrant ancestry.
   Although A. californiense is typically associated with breeding ponds in
   grassland habitat, we found that dispersal through grassland is nearly
   twice as costly as dispersal through chaparral and that oak woodland is
   by far the most costly habitat to traverse. With the increasing
   availability of molecular resources and GIS data, we anticipate that
   these methods could be applied to a broad range of study systems,
   particularly those with cryptic life histories that make direct
   observation of movement challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative studies of codistributed taxa test the degree to which
   historical processes have shaped contemporary population structure.
   Discordant patterns of lineage divergence among taxa indicate that
   species differ in their response to common historical processes. The
   complex geologic landscape of the Isthmus of Central America provides an
   ideal setting to test the effects of vicariance and other biogeographic
   factors on population history. We compared divergence patterns between
   two codistributed Neotropical frogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus and
   Agalychnis callidryas) that exhibit colour pattern polymorphisms among
   populations, and found significant differences between them in
   phenotypic and genetic divergence among populations. Colour pattern in
   D. ebraccatus did not vary with genetic or geographic distance, while
   colour pattern co-varied with patterns of gene flow in A. callidryas. In
   addition, we detected significant species differences in the
   phylogenetic history of populations, gene flow among them, and the
   extent to which historical diversification and recent gene flow have
   been restricted by five biogeographic barriers in Costa Rica and Panama.
   We inferred that alternate microevolutionary processes explain the
   unique patterns of diversification in each taxon. Our study underscores
   how differences in selective regimes and species-typical ecological and
   life-history traits maintain spatial patterns of diversification.}},

Title = {{More introgression with less gene flow: chloroplast vs. mitochondrial
   DNA in the Picea asperata complex in China, and comparison with other
   Conifers}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has suggested that rates of introgression should be
   inversely related to levels of gene flow because introgressed
   populations cannot be `rescued' by intraspecific gene flow if it is too
   low. Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA (mtDNA and cpDNA) experience very
   different levels of gene flow in conifers due to their contrasted
   maternal and paternal modes of transmission, hence the prediction that
   mtDNA should introgress more readily than cpDNA in this group. Here, we
   use sequence data from both mtDNA and cpDNA to test this hypothesis in a
   group of closely related spruces species, the Picea asperata complex
   from China. Nine mitochondrial and nine chloroplast haplotypes were
   recovered from 459 individuals in 46 natural populations belonging to
   five species of the Picea asperata complex. Low variation was found in
   the two mtDNA introns along with a high level of differentiation among
   populations (G(ST) = 0.90). In contrast, we detected higher variation
   and lower differentiation among populations at cpDNA markers (G(ST) =
   0.56), a trend shared by most conifer species studied so far. We found
   that cpDNA variation, although far from being fully diagnostic, is more
   species-specific than mtDNA variation: four groups of populations were
   identified using cpDNA markers, all of them related to species or groups
   of species, whereas for mtDNA, geographical variation prevails over
   species differentiation. The literature suggests that mtDNA haplotypes
   are often shared among related conifer species, whereas cpDNA haplotypes
   are more species-specific. Hence, increased intraspecific gene flow
   appears to decrease differentiation within species but not among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{In the carabid genus Carabus subgenus Ohomopterus, diverged body size
   and genital morphology serve as mechanical reproductive barriers. To
   elucidate the diverging process of body and genital sizes in Carabus
   arrowianus, which exhibits marked morphological diversity among
   geographical populations and may represent an early stage of speciation,
   we analysed a mitochondrial gene sequence for 1051 individuals from 63
   populations and male morphology for 359 individuals from 47 populations.
   Two discrete morphological groups segregated by geographical barriers
   were distinguished, one of which possessed smaller bodies and shorter
   genitalia (S group) than the other (L group), which exhibited larger
   bodies and exaggerated genitalia. Genetic divergence between the two
   groups was significant but not large. Phylogeographical and population
   genetic analyses indicated that the L group was derived from the S
   group, and a coalescent simulation revealed that the two groups diverged
   during the latest middle Pleistocene (0.13 million years ago), with a
   much larger effective population size in the L group than the S group.
   Because the body size divergence could not be explained by adaptation to
   climatic conditions and genital morphology is considered to be subject
   to sexual selection, we postulated that a population division and
   colonization in favourable habitats caused by the Pleistocene climatic
   and geographical change might facilitate natural and sexual selection
   for enlarged body and genital sizes in the L group.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates patterns of genetic connectivity among 11
   co-distributed tropical rainforest tree species from the genus
   Elaeocarpus across a biogeographic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor
   (BMC) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We analysed a combination of
   allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers,
   and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and
   functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results
   indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype
   distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern.
   Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting
   genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species
   appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration
   opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In
   contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian
   rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated
   with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how
   external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this
   study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and
   environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level
   patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups
   respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict
   responses to future change.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the occurrence of allotriploidy (having three
   differentiated genomes) in gametophytes of two Southern Hemisphere
   Sphagnum species (S. australe, S. falcatulum). The pattern of
   microsatellite alleles indicates that both species are composed of a
   complex of allodiploid and allotriploid gametophytes, with the latter
   resulting from two allopolyploidization events. No haploid (n = x)
   gametophytes were found for either species. The ploidal levels suggested
   by the pattern of microsatellite alleles were confirmed by flow
   cytometry and Feulgen DNA image densitometry. For both S. australe and
   S. falcatulum, the respective allodiploid plants (or their ancestors)
   are one of the parent species of the allotriploid plants. This is the
   first report of triploidy in Sphagnum gametophytes occurring in nature
   and also the first report of the presence of three differentiated
   genomes in any bryophyte. It is also the first report of intersectional
   allopolyploidy in Sphagnum, with S. australe appearing to have parental
   species from Sphagnum sections Rigida and Sphagnum, and S. falcatulum
   having parental species from Sphagnum sections Cuspidata and Subsecunda.
   In both species, the allotriploid cytotypes were the most prevalent
   cytotype on the South Island of New Zealand. The pattern of
   microsatellite alleles shows the presence of two genetically distinct
   populations of allodiploid S. australe, possibly indicating multiple
   origins of polyploidy for that allodiploid cytotype. Morphological
   evidence is also highly indicative of recurrent polyploidy in the
   allotriploid cytotype of S. falcatulum. Allopolyploidy has clearly
   played a major evolutionary role in these two Southern Hemisphere taxa.

Abstract = {{The relationship between anthropogenic impact and the maintenance of
   biodiversity is a fundamental question in ecology. The emphasis on the
   organizational level of biodiversity responsible for ecosystem processes
   is shifting from a species-centred focus to include genotypic diversity.
   The relationship between biodiversity measures at these two scales
   remains largely unknown. By stratifying anthropogenic effects between
   scales of biodiversity of bacterial communities, we show a statistically
   significant difference in diversity based on taxonomic scale.
   Communities with intermediate species richness show high genotypic
   diversity while speciose and species-poor communities do not. We propose
   that in species-poor communities, generally comprising stable yet harsh
   conditions, physiological tolerance and competitive trade-offs limit
   both the number of species that occur and the loss of genotypes due to
   decreases in already constrained fitness. In species-rich communities,
   natural environmental conditions result in well-defined community
   structure and resource partitioning. Disturbance of these communities
   disrupts niche space, resulting in lower genotypic diversity despite the
   maintenance of species diversity. Our work provides a model to inform
   future research about relationships between species and genotypic
   biodiversity based on determining the biodiversity consequences of
   changing environmental context.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation by host shift is a common phenomenon observed in many
   symbiotic animals. The symbiont-host interaction is highly dynamic, but
   it is poorly documented in the marine realm. In the present study, we
   examined the genetic and morphological differentiation of the coral
   barnacle Wanella milleporae (obligate to fire corals) collected from
   four different Millepora host species in Taiwan to investigate the host
   specificity of this barnacle. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial COI
   gene for 241 individuals of Wanella revealed five distinct clades, whose
   sequence divergences are comparable to values between other cogeneric
   barnacle species. The five clades also differ in shell and opercular
   plate morphology and colour. Genetic and morphological differentiations
   together strongly suggest the presence of cryptic species. Although the
   five clades do not display species-level host specificity, they showed a
   significant difference in preference on host growth form. Clades 1 and 2
   were predominantly found on encrusting Millepora exaesa and Millepora
   platyphylla, while clades 3, 4 and 5 live exclusively on branching-form
   fire corals Millepora dichotoma and Millepora tenella. Phylogeny
   inferred from the combined mitochondrial COI, 16S and 12S (2182 bp)
   analysis suggests the division of the five clades into two major
   lineages congruent with the morphology of the host coral. Multiple
   independent invasions to the same form of host and subsequent speciation
   are evident in the Red Sea and Taiwan. Our results indicate that
   ecological/sympatric speciation could occur in marine symbiotic
   invertebrates through host shift and specialization. It appears that, as
   in their terrestrial counterparts, host-symbiont radiations in the
   marine realm are more prevalent than we expected and thus warrant
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic mating systems are expected to vary among and within populations
   in response to environmental and demographic factors. Despite the fact
   that mating system variation theoretically can have profound effects on
   important evolutionary processes such as sexual selection, extensive
   intraspecific surveys of geographical variation in mating systems are
   rare. We used microsatellite markers to characterize genetic mating
   systems of dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae, from five populations
   distributed from the mid-Atlantic Coast to the Western Gulf of Mexico.
   We also measured a number of environmental and demographic variables to
   examine correlations between the ecological setting and mating
   behaviour. Our results show that dusky pipefish are polygynandrous
   throughout their USA distribution, but they exhibit a wide range of
   quantitative variation in male mating behaviour. In addition, these five
   populations varied substantially with respect to environmental and
   demographic variables, and some of these were significantly correlated
   with aspects of the genetic mating system. While causal relationships
   cannot be firmly diagnosed from this type of comparative study, our
   results do identify several ecological factors, such as water
   temperature, adult sex ratio, and seagrass biomass, which should be
   considered in future experimental and comparative work. Overall, this
   study confirms the expectation that geographical variation in mating
   systems is widespread and shows that the dusky pipefish is an excellent
   model for continued research into the factors affecting mating systems
   in nature.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The fitness consequences of heterozygosity and the mechanisms
   underpinning them are still highly controversial. Using
   capture-mark-recapture models, we investigated the effects of individual
   heterozygosity, measured at 16 microsatellite markers, on age-dependent
   survival and access to dominance in a socially monogamous mammalian
   species, the alpine marmot. We found a positive correlation between
   standardized multilocus heterozygosity and juvenile survival. However,
   there was no correlation between standardized multilocus heterozygosity
   and either survival of older individuals or access to dominance. The
   disappearance of a significant heterozygosity fitness correlation when
   individuals older than juveniles are considered is consistent with the
   prediction that differences in survival among individuals are maximal
   early in life. The lack of a correlation between heterozygosity and
   access to dominance may be a consequence of few homozygous individuals
   attaining the age at which they might reach dominance. Two hypotheses
   have been proposed to explain heterozygosity-fitness correlations:
   genome-wide effects reflected by all markers or local effects of
   specific markers linked to genes that determine fitness. In accordance
   with genome-wide effects of heterozygosity, we found significant
   correlations between heterozygosities calculated across single locus or
   across two sets of eight loci. Thus, the genome-wide heterozygosity
   effect seems to explain the observed heterozygosity-fitness correlation
   in the alpine marmot.}},

Abstract = {{The black surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni and the striped surfperch E.
   lateralis (Embiotocidae, Perciformes) are livebearing temperate reef
   fishes that live sympatrically over a large portion of their
   distribution range, where they exhibit strong ecological competition. In
   order to assess whether mating strategies reflect competition, we
   investigated multiple paternity in these two species in an area of
   sympatry. We sampled 24 pregnant females (12 for each species) in
   Monterey Bay, California, used microsatellite analysis and assessed
   paternity with the COLONY software. While broods are relatively small
   (12 to 36 offspring), they were always sired by multiple fathers (2 to
   9), with no correlation between the size of a brood and the number of
   fathers. The number of sires for each brood was not significantly
   different between the two species (approximately 3.5 sires per brood).
   We tested the deviation from stochasticity of fathered offspring for
   each father in one brood. Results showed a significant deviation for
   both E. jacksoni and E. lateralis. However, this deviation was not found
   to be significant between species. The striking similarity in the
   dynamics of multiple paternity in these species, when sampled in
   sympatry, may result from several alternative scenarios, including
   phylogenetic inertia, reproductive behaviour, and ecological
   competition.}},

Abstract = {{The mating system of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) has been regarded as
   one of the most panmictic in the animal kingdom, with thousands of males
   aggregating in drone congregation areas (DCAs) that virgin queens visit
   to mate with tens of partners. Although males from many colonies gather
   at such congregations, the temporal changes in the colonies contributing
   drones remain unknown. Yet, changes in the DCAs' genetic structure will
   ultimately determine population gene flow and effective population size.
   By repeatedly sampling drones from an African DCA over a period of 3
   years, we studied the temporal changes in the genetic structure of a
   wild honeybee population. Using three sets of tightly linked
   microsatellite markers, we were able to reconstruct individual queen
   genotypes with a high accuracy, follow them through time and estimate
   their rate of replacement. The number of queens contributing drones to
   the DCA varied from 12 to 72 and was correlated with temperature and
   rainfall. We found that more than 80\% of these queens were replaced by
   mostly unrelated ones in successive eight months sampling intervals,
   which resulted in a clear temporal genetic differentiation of the DCA.
   Our results suggest that the frequent long-range migration of colonies
   without nest-site fidelity is the main driver of this high queen

Abstract = {{In this study, we present the genetic analysis of a new collection of
   wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) using 42 simple sequence repeat (SSR)
   markers that represent the seven chromosomes. The Barley1K (B1K)
   infrastructure consists of 1020 accessions collected in a hierarchical
   sampling mode (HSM) from 51 sites across Israel and represents the wide
   adaptive niche of the modern barley's ancestor. According to the genetic
   structure analysis, the sampled sites can be divided into seven groups,
   and sampled microsites located on opposing slopes or in different soil
   types did not show significant genetic differentiation. Although the
   genetic analysis indicates a simple isolation-by-distance model among
   the populations, examination of the genetic populations' structure with
   abiotic parameters in an ordination analysis revealed that the
   combination of elevation, mid-day temperature and rainfall explains a
   high proportion of the variance in the principal components analysis.
   Our findings demonstrate that the current populations have therefore
   been shaped and distinguished by non-selective forces such as migration;
   however, we suggest that aridity and temperature gradients played major
   roles as selective forces in the adaptation of wild barley in this part
   of the Fertile Crescent. This unique collection is a prelude for the
   investigation of the molecular basis underlying plant adaptation and
   responsiveness to harsh environments.}},

Abstract = {{The complex structure of a single Mendelian factor widespread in the
   Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild progenitor (Oryza
   rufipogon) that caused diverse phenotypes in the timing of flowering
   under natural field conditions was investigated in near isogenic lines.
   These near isogenic lines showed differences in flowering time despite
   all eight accessions collected from tropical regions possessing a
   recessive gene allelic to the se-pat gene. Fine mapping in two of these
   near-isogenic lines revealed that cultivated (Patpaku) and wild (W593)
   accessions had three and two linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the
   candidate regions, respectively, showing that Patpaku and W593 possessed
   linked QTLs with different effects in addition to the commonly-observed
   recessive gene (se-pat). Molecular dissection suggested that the
   tandemly duplicated FT-like genes (Hd3a and RFT1) could be the candidate
   genes for these QTLs. Interestingly, the linked QTLs differed in their
   epistases, degree of dominance, and genotype x environment interactions.
   The nucleotide sequences showed that RFT1 has diverged more rapidly than
   Hd3a during rice evolution, suggesting phenotypic diversification of the
   two genes. Phylogenetic analysis implied that the se-pat(+) alleles
   might have emerged in different lineages within O. sativa. The present
   results strongly suggest that nucleotide divergence and shuffling of the
   linked QTLs by recombination might have created novel Mendelian factors
   that probably contribute to responding to local environments.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{1551-1552}},

Abstract = {{Numerous approaches have been developed to examine recent and historical
   gene flow between populations, but few studies have used empirical data
   sets to compare different approaches. Some methods are expected to
   perform better under particular scenarios, such as high or low gene
   flow, but this, too, has rarely been tested. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Saenz-Agudelo et al. (2009) apply assignment tests and
   parentage analysis to microsatellite data from five geographically
   proximal (2-6 km) and one much more distant (1500 km) panda clownfish
   populations, showing that parentage analysis performed better in
   situations of high gene flow, while their assignment tests did better
   with low gene flow. This unusually complete data set is comprised of
   multiple exhaustively sampled populations, including nearly all adults
   and large numbers of juveniles, enabling the authors to ask questions
   that in many systems would be impossible to answer. Their results
   emphasize the importance of selecting the right analysis to use, based
   on the underlying model and how well its assumptions are met by the
   populations to be analysed.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness of statistical haplotype inference makes it
   an area of active exploration over the last decade. There are several
   complications of statistical inference, including: the same algorithm
   can produce different solutions for the same data set, which reflects
   the internal algorithm variability; different algorithms can give
   different solutions for the same data set, reflecting the discordance
   among algorithms; and the algorithms per se are unable to evaluate the
   reliability of the solutions even if they are unique, this being a
   general limitation of all inference methods. With the aim of increasing
   the confidence of statistical inference results, consensus strategy
   appears to be an effective means to deal with these problems. Several
   authors have explored this with different emphases. Here we discuss two
   recent studies examining the internal algorithm variability and
   among-algorithm discordance, respectively, and evaluate the different
   outcomes of these analyses, in light of Orzack (2009) comment. Until
   other, better methods are developed, a combination of these two
   approaches should provide a practical way to increase the confidence of
   statistical haplotyping results.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species are known to cause environmental and economic damage,
   requiring management by control agencies worldwide. These species often
   become well established in new environments long before their detection,
   resulting in a lack of knowledge regarding their history and dynamics.
   When new invasions are discovered, information regarding the source and
   pathway of the invasion, and the degree of connectivity with other
   populations can greatly benefit management strategies. Here we use
   invasive common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) populations from Australia
   to demonstrate that genetic techniques can provide this information to
   aid management, even when applied to highly vagile species over
   continental scales. Analysis of data from 11 microsatellites in 662
   individuals sampled at 17 localities across their introduced range in
   Australia revealed four populations. One population consisted of all
   sampling sites from the expansion front in Western Australia, where
   control efforts are focused. Despite evidence of genetic exchange over
   both contemporary and historical timescales, gene flow is low between
   this population and all three more easterly populations. This suggests
   that localized control of starlings on the expansion front may be an
   achievable goal and the long-standing practice of targeting select
   proximal eastern source populations may be ineffective on its own.
   However, even with low levels of gene flow, successful control of
   starlings on the expansion front will require vigilance, and genetic
   monitoring of this population can provide essential information to
   managers. The techniques used here are broadly applicable to invasive
   populations worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Population outbreaks of the coral-eating starfish, Acanthaster planci,
   are hypothesized to spread to many localities in the Indo-Pacific Ocean
   through dispersal of planktonic larvae. To elucidate the gene flow of A.
   planci across the Indo-Pacific in relation to ocean currents and to test
   the larval dispersal hypothesis, the genetic structure among 23 samples
   over the Indo-Pacific was analysed using seven highly polymorphic
   microsatellite loci. The F-statistics and genetic admixture analysis
   detected genetically distinct groups in accordance with ocean current
   systems, that is, the Southeast African group (Kenya and Mayotte), the
   Northwestern Pacific group (the Philippines and Japan), Palau, the North
   Central Pacific group (Majuro and Pohnpei), the Great Barrier Reef,
   Fiji, and French Polynesia, with a large genetic break between the
   Indian and Pacific Oceans. A pattern of significant isolation by
   distance was observed among all samples (P = 0.001, r = 0.88, n = 253,
   Mantel test), indicating restricted gene flow among the samples in
   accordance with geographical distances. The data also indicated strong
   gene flow within the Southeast African, Northwestern Pacific, and Great
   Barrier Reef groups. These results suggest that the western boundary
   currents have strong influence on gene flow of this species and may
   trigger secondary outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Polygyny is expected to erode genetic variability by reducing the
   diversity of genetic contribution of males to the next generation,
   although empirical evidence shows that genetic variability in polygynous
   populations is not lost as rapidly as expected. We used microsatellite
   markers to study the genetic variability transmitted by mothers and
   fathers to offspring during a reproductive season in wild populations of
   a polygynous mammal, the red deer. Contrary to expectations, we found
   that males contributed more genetic diversity than females. Also, we
   compared study populations with different degrees of polygyny to find
   that polygyny was not related to a decrease in genetic diversity
   contributed by males. On the contrary, when population genetic diversity
   was relatively low, polygyny associated with higher genetic diversity of
   paternal lineage. Our results show that sexual selection, by favouring
   heterozygote individuals, may compensate the potential reduction of
   effective population size caused by polygyny, thus contributing to
   explain why genetic diversity is not depleted in polygynous systems.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{To be effective, management programmes geared towards halting or
   reversing the spread of invasive species must focus on defined and
   defensible areas. This requires knowledge of the dispersal of non-native
   species targeted for control to better understand invasion and
   recolonisation scenarios. We investigated the genetic structure of
   invasive American mink (Neovison vison) in Scotland, and incorporated
   landscape genetic approaches to examine resultant patterns in relation
   to geographical features that may influence dispersal. Populations of
   mink sampled from 10 sites in two regions (Argyll and Northeast
   Scotland) show a distinct genetic structure. First, the majority of
   pairwise population comparisons yielded F-ST values that were
   significantly greater than zero. Second, amova revealed that most of the
   genetic variance was attributable to differences among regions.
   Assignment tests placed 89 or more of individuals into their sampled
   region. Bayesian clustering methods grouped samples into two clusters
   according to their region of origin. Wombling approach identified the
   Cairngorms Mountains as a major impediment to gene flow between the
   regions. Mantel pairwise correlations between genetic and geographical
   distances estimated as least-cost distance assuming a linear increase in
   the cost of movement with increasing elevation were higher than
   Euclidean distances or distance along waterways. Spatial autocorrelation
   analyses revealed stronger spatial structuring for females than for
   males. These results suggest that gene flow by American mink is
   restricted by landscape features (mountain ranges) and that eradication
   attempt should in the first instance break down the connectivity between
   management units separated by mountains.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1616-1628}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic parthenogenesis, the alternation of parthenogenetic and sexual
   reproduction, can lead to a wide scope of population structures, ranging
   from almost monoclonal to genetically highly diverse populations. In
   addition, sexual reproduction in aquatic cyclic parthenogens is
   associated with the production of dormant stages, which both enhance
   potential gene flow among populations as well as impact local
   evolutionary rates through the formation of dormant egg banks. Members
   of the cladoceran genus Daphnia are widely distributed key organisms in
   freshwater habitats, which mostly exhibit this reproduction mode. We
   assessed patterns of genetic variation within and among populations in
   the eurytopic and morphologically variable species Daphnia longispina,
   using data from both nuclear (13 microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial
   (partial sequencing of the 12S rRNA gene) markers from a set of
   populations sampled across Europe. Most populations were characterized
   by very high clonal diversity, reflecting an important impact of sexual
   reproduction and low levels of clonal selection. Among-population
   genetic differentiation was very high for both nuclear and mitochondrial
   markers, and no strong pattern of isolation by distance was observed. We
   also did not observe any substantial genetic differentiation among
   traditionally recognized morphotypes of D. longispina. Our findings of
   high levels of within-population genetic variation combined with high
   among-population genetic differentiation are in line with predictions of
   the monopolization hypothesis, which suggests that in species with rapid
   population growth and potential for local adaptation, strong priority
   effects due to monopolization of resources lead to reduced levels of
   gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history characteristics are an important determinant of a species'
   dispersal abilities. We predict that variation in life history can
   influence population-level genetic patterns. To test this prediction, we
   estimate population-level genetic structure for two sympatric species of
   stream-breeding salamander. The Cope's giant salamander (Dicamptodon
   copei) rarely metamorphoses into a terrestrial adult, thereby limiting
   overland dispersal and potentially gene flow. In contrast, the Pacific
   giant salamander (D. tenebrosus) commonly metamorphoses, which is
   expected to facilitate overland dispersal and gene flow. Three sets of
   analyses based on microsatellite data support these hypotheses, showing
   that D. tenebrosus displays minimal population-level genetic structuring
   and no pattern of isolation by distance, whereas D. copei displays a
   high degree of population-level genetic structure and significant
   isolation by distance. Specifically, nearly all pairwise F-ST values
   were significantly different from 0 between populations of D. copei,
   with fewer than half the pairwise F-ST values significant from 0 in D.
   tenebrosus. Additionally, Structure analyses indicated eight genetic
   clusters for D. copei but only one genetic cluster for D. tenebrosus.
   Finally, Mantel tests showed significant correlations between stream and
   overland distance with genetic distance for D. copei but no significant
   correlations of either landscape feature for D. tenebrosus at the scale
   of the study. These results provide a case study of the link between
   life-history variation and population genetic patterns while controlling
   for phylogeny and environmental variation.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeography of Central America is viewed as a classic case study in
   understanding the impact of vicariant events on patterns of biotic
   dispersal. While many biogeographers have focused on community
   composition and geographical limits of species at broad scales across
   Central America, much less work has focused on post-colonization
   diversification patterns at finer scales. The livebearing freshwater
   fish Xenophallus umbratilis presents an ideal system for determining the
   impact of recent Earth history events on biodiversity in northern Costa
   Rica. Here, we test the hypotheses that marine inundation of the San
   Carlos and northern Limon basins during the Pliocene and Pleistocene has
   caused genetic fragmentation among X. umbratilis populations, despite
   contemporary freshwater connections. To test this idea, we collected
   mitochondrial (cytochrome b) sequence data in 162 individuals taken from
   27 localities across northern Costa Rica. We employed a variety of
   analytical approaches, including: maximum parsimony and maximum
   likelihood, analysis of molecular variance, and demographic analysis of
   population size through time. We found four major clades within X.
   umbratilis, each geographically isolated with no shared haplotypes
   across drainages. Oddly, clades that occupy adjacent drainages are not
   always sister taxa in the phylogeny, suggesting that colonization in
   this species is more complex than a simple model of isolation by
   distance. All our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   changes in sea level associated with glacial eustatic cycles have had an
   important effect in shaping diversification patterns in this species.}},

Abstract = {{A north/south discontinuity along the northeastern coast of North
   America in the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus
   americanus) was detected using a suite of 13 microsatellite loci
   assessed using spatial analyses. Population genetic data laid over

   used to reconstruct the Pleistocene distribution of this species. A
   postglacial northern-edge colonization model best explains the relative
   genetic homogeneity of the northern region compared to the southern
   region centred in the Gulf of Maine. Population genetic analyses
   identified significant structure (range of standardized theta 0-0.02)
   but no significant evidence for isolation by distance. The novel
   application of spatial genetic analyses to a marine species allowed us
   to interpret these results by providing a greater insight into the

Abstract = {{Lions were the most widespread carnivores in the late Pleistocene,
   ranging from southern Africa to the southern USA, but little is known
   about the evolutionary relationships among these Pleistocene populations
   or the dynamics that led to their extinction. Using ancient DNA
   techniques, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from 52 individuals
   sampled across the present and former range of lions. Phylogenetic
   analysis revealed three distinct clusters: (i) modern lions, Panthera
   leo; (ii) extinct Pleistocene cave lions, which formed a homogeneous
   population extending from Europe across Beringia (Siberia, Alaska and
   western Canada); and (iii) extinct American lions, which formed a
   separate population south of the Pleistocene ice sheets. The American
   lion appears to have become genetically isolated around 340 000 years
   ago, despite the apparent lack of significant barriers to gene flow with
   Beringian populations through much of the late Pleistocene. We found
   potential evidence of a severe population bottleneck in the cave lion
   during the previous interstadial, sometime after 48 000 years, adding to
   evidence from bison, mammoths, horses and brown bears that megafaunal
   populations underwent major genetic alterations throughout the last
   interstadial, potentially presaging the processes involved in the
   subsequent end-Pleistocene mass extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating patterns of genetic variation in hybridizing species
   provides an opportunity to understand the impact of natural selection on
   intraspecific genetic variability and interspecific gene exchange. The
   Atlantic eels Anguilla rostrata and A. anguilla each occupy a large
   heterogeneous habitat upon which natural selection could differentially
   shape genetic variation. They also produce viable hybrids only found in
   Iceland. However, the possible footprint of natural selection on
   patterns of genetic variation within species and introgressive
   hybridization in Icelandic eels has never been assessed. We revisited
   amplified fragment length polymorphism data collected previously using
   population genomics and admixture analyses to test if (i) genetic
   variation could be influenced by non-neutral mechanisms at both the
   intra- and interspecific levels, and if (ii) selection could shape the
   spatio-temporal distribution of Icelandic hybrids. We first found
   candidate loci for directional selection within both species. Spatial
   distributions of allelic frequencies displayed by some of these loci
   were possibly related with the geographical patterns of life-history
   traits in A. rostrata, and could have been shaped by natural selection
   associated with an environmental gradient along European coasts in A.
   anguilla. Second, we identified outlier loci at the interspecific level.
   Non-neutral introgression was strongly suggested for some of these loci.
   We detected a locus at which typical A. rostrata allele hardly crossed
   the species genetic barrier, whereas three other loci showed accelerated
   patterns of introgression into A. anguilla in Iceland. Moreover, the
   level of introgression at these three loci increased from the glass eel
   to the yellow eel stage, supporting the hypothesis that differential
   survival of admixed genotypes partly explains the spatio-temporal
   pattern of hybrid abundance previously documented in Iceland.}},

Abstract = {{We present SSU rDNA data resolving the seasonal and geographical
   distribution of `cryptic' genetic types of the planktonic foraminifer
   morphospecies Globigerinoides ruber in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and
   the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of 262 sequences revealed the presence
   of five genetic types belonging to two distinct lineages. Although the
   morphospecies G. ruber occurs throughout the investigated region, its
   constituent `cryptic' genetic types show a pattern of widespread
   exclusion, which is difficult to reconcile with the concept of
   ubiquitous dispersal. One of the newly discovered genetic types was
   exclusively found at stations in the Mediterranean Sea, possibly
   representing the smallest-scale example of endemism known in planktonic
   foraminifera. In general, our results suggest that the geographical
   scale of mutual exclusion between the genotypes is negatively correlated
   with their phylogenetic relatedness: the most similar and most recently
   diverged pair of siblings showed the strongest evidence for small-scale
   competitive exclusion. This pattern is consistent with the concept of
   niche partitioning, implying decreasing level of competition between
   genetic types with increasing degree of genetic divergence.}},

Abstract = {{The African baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) is an emblematic, culturally
   important, and physically huge tropical tree species whose natural
   geographical distribution comprises most of tropical Africa, but also
   small patches of southern Arabia, and several Atlantic and Indian Ocean
   islands surrounding the African continent, notably including Madagascar.
   We analysed the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism of five chloroplast DNA fragments obtained from 344
   individuals of A. digitata collected from 74 populations covering the
   entire extant distribution range of the species. Our goal was to
   reconstruct the phylogeographical history of the species and, if
   possible, to identify its centre of origin, which has been a subject of
   controversy for many decades. We identified five haplotypes whose
   distribution is clearly geographically structured. Using several species
   of Adansonia and of closely related genera as outgroups, the haplotypes
   showed a clear phylogeographical pattern of three groups. Two are
   phylogenetically related to the outgroup taxa, and are distributed in
   West Africa. The third group is substantially more differentiated
   genetically from outgroup species, and it corresponds to southern and
   eastern Africa, Arabia and the Indian Ocean islands, including
   Madagascar. According to our results, the tetraploid A. digitata, or its
   diploid progenitor, probably originated in West Africa and migrated
   subsequently throughout the tropical parts of that continent, and
   beyond, by natural and human-mediated terrestrial and overseas
   dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Global biodiversity peaks in the tropical forests of the Andes, a
   striking geological feature that has likely been instrumental in
   generating biodiversity by providing opportunities for both vicariant
   and ecological speciation. However, the role of these mountains in the
   diversification of insects, which dominate biodiversity, has been poorly
   explored using phylogenetic methods. Here we study the role of the Andes
   in the evolution of a diverse Neotropical insect group, the clearwing
   butterflies. We used dated species-level phylogenies to investigate the
   time course of speciation and to infer ancestral elevation ranges for
   two diverse genera. We show that both genera likely originated at middle
   elevations in the Andes in the Middle Miocene, contrasting with most
   published results in vertebrates that point to a lowland origin.
   Although we detected a signature of vicariance caused by the uplift of
   the Andes at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, most sister species were
   parapatric without any obvious vicariant barrier. Combined with an
   overall decelerating speciation rate, these results suggest an important
   role for ecological speciation and adaptive radiation, rather than
   simple vicariance.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary climatic oscillations greatly influenced the present-day
   population genetic structure of animals and plants. For species with
   high dispersal and reproductive potential, phylogeographic patterns
   resulting from historical processes can be cryptic, overshadowed by
   contemporary processes. Here we report a study of the phylogeography of
   Odocoileus hemionus, a large, vagile ungulate common throughout western
   North America. We examined sequence variation of mitochondrial DNA
   (control region and cytochrome b) within and among 70 natural
   populations across the entire range of the species. Among the 1766
   individual animals surveyed, we recovered 496 haplotypes. Although
   fine-scale phylogenetic structure was weakly resolved using phylogenetic
   methods, network analysis clearly revealed the presence of 12 distinct
   haplogroups. The spatial distribution of haplogroups showed a strong
   genetic discontinuity between the two morphological types of O.
   hemionus, mule deer and black-tailed deer, east and west of the Cascade
   Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. Within the mule deer lineage, we
   identified several haplogroups that expanded before or during the Last
   Glacial Maximum, suggesting that mule deer persisted in multiple refugia
   south of the ice sheets. Patterns of genetic diversity within the
   black-tailed deer lineage suggest a single refugium along the Pacific
   Northwest coast, and refute the hypothesis that black-tailed deer
   persisted in one or more northern refugia. Our data suggest that
   black-tailed deer recolonized areas in accordance with the pattern of
   glacial retreat, with initial recolonization northward along a coastal
   route and secondary recolonization inland.}},

Abstract = {{The Hawaiian archipelago is often cited as the premier setting to study
   biological diversification, yet the evolution and phylogeography of much
   of its biota remain poorly understood. We investigated crab spiders
   (Thomisidae, Mecaphesa) that demonstrate contradictory tendencies: (i)
   dramatic ecological diversity within the Hawaiian Islands, and (ii)
   accompanying widespread distribution of many species across the
   archipelago. We used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data sampled
   across six islands to generate phylogenetic hypotheses for Mecaphesa
   species and populations, and included penalized likelihood molecular
   clock analyses to estimate arrival times on the different islands. We
   found that 17 of 18 Hawaiian Mecaphesa species were monophyletic and
   most closely related to thomisids from the Marquesas and Society
   Islands. Our results indicate that the Hawaiian species evolved from
   either one or two colonization events to the archipelago. Estimated
   divergence dates suggested that thomisids may have colonized the
   Hawaiian Islands as early as similar to 10 million years ago, but
   biogeographic analyses implied that the initial diversification of this
   group was restricted to the younger island of Oahu, followed by
   back-colonizations to older islands. Within the Hawaiian radiation, our
   data revealed several well-supported genetically distinct terminal
   clades corresponding to species previously delimited by morphological
   taxonomy. Many of these species are codistributed across multiple
   Hawaiian Islands and some exhibit genetic structure consistent with
   stepwise colonization of islands following their formation. These
   results indicate that dispersal has been sufficiently limited to allow
   extensive ecological diversification, yet frequent enough that
   interisland migration is more common than speciation.}},

Abstract = {{The application of spatially explicit models of population dynamics to
   fisheries management and the design marine reserve network systems has
   been limited due to a lack of empirical estimates of larval dispersal.
   Here we compared assignment tests and parentage analysis for examining
   larval retention and connectivity under two different gene flow
   scenarios using panda clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) in Papua New
   Guinea. A metapopulation of panda clownfish in Bootless Bay with little
   or no genetic differentiation among five spatially discrete locations
   separated by 2-6 km provided the high gene flow scenario. The low gene
   flow scenario compared the Bootless Bay metapopulation with a
   genetically distinct population (F(ST) = 0.1) located at Schumann
   Island, New Britain, 1500 km to the northeast. We used assignment tests
   and parentage analysis based on microsatellite DNA data to identify
   natal origins of 177 juveniles in Bootless Bay and 73 juveniles at
   Schumann Island. At low rates of gene flow, assignment tests correctly
   classified juveniles to their source population. On the other hand,
   parentage analysis led to an overestimate of self-recruitment within the
   two populations due to the significant deviation from panmixia when both
   populations were pooled. At high gene flow (within Bootless Bay),
   assignment tests underestimated self-recruitment and connectivity among
   subpopulations, and grossly overestimated self-recruitment within the
   overall metapopulation. However, the assignment tests did identify
   immigrants from distant (genetically distinct) populations. Parentage
   analysis clearly provided the most accurate estimates of connectivity in
   situations of high gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Complex sex-biased dispersal patterns often characterize
   social-group-living species and may ultimately drive patterns of
   cooperation and competition within and among groups. This study
   investigates whether observational data or genetic data alone can
   elucidate the potentially complex dispersal patterns of
   social-group-living black and white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza,
   `guerezas'), or whether combining both data types provides novel
   insights. We employed long-term observation of eight neighbouring
   guereza groups in Kibale National Park, Uganda, as well as
   microsatellite genotyping of these and two other neighbouring groups. We
   created a statistical model to examine the observational data and used
   dyadic relatedness values within and among groups to analyse the genetic
   data. Analyses of observational and genetic data both supported the
   conclusion that males typically disperse from their natal groups and
   often transfer into nearby groups and probably beyond. Both data types
   also supported the conclusion that females are more philopatric than
   males but provided somewhat conflicting evidence about the extent of
   female philopatry. Observational data suggested that female dispersal is
   rare or nonexistent and transfers into neighbouring groups do not occur,
   but genetic data revealed numerous pairs of closely related adult
   females among neighbouring groups. Only by combining both data types
   were we able to understand the complexity of sex-biased dispersal
   patterns in guerezas and the processes that could explain our seemingly
   conflicting results. We suggest that the data are compatible with a
   scenario of group dissolution prior to the start of this study, followed
   by female transfers into different neighbouring groups.}},

Abstract = {{The very diverse social systems of sweat bees make them interesting
   models to study social evolution. Here we focus on the dispersal
   behaviour and social organization of Halictus scabiosae, a common yet
   poorly known species of Europe. By combining field observations and
   genetic data, we show that females have multiple reproductive
   strategies, which generates a large diversity in the social structure of
   nests. A detailed microsatellite analysis of 60 nests revealed that 55\%
   of the nests contained the offspring of a single female, whereas the
   rest had more complex social structures, with three clear cases of
   multiple females reproducing in the same nest and frequent occurrence of
   unrelated individuals. Drifting among nests was surprisingly common, as
   16\% of the 122 nests in the overall sample and 44\% of the nests with
   complex social structure contained females that had genotypes consistent
   with being full-sisters of females sampled in other nests of the
   population. Drifters originated from nests with an above-average
   productivity and were unrelated to their nestmates, suggesting that
   drifting might be a strategy to avoid competition among related females.
   The sex-specific comparison of genetic differentiation indicated that
   dispersal was male-biased, which would reinforce local resource
   competition among females. The pattern of genetic differentiation among
   populations was consistent with a dynamic process of patch colonization
   and extinction, as expected from the unstable, anthropogenic habitat of
   this species. Overall, our data show that H. scabiosae varies greatly in
   dispersal behaviour and social organization. The surprisingly high
   frequency of drifters echoes recent findings in wasps and bees, calling
   for further investigation of the adaptive basis of drifting in the
   social insects.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding indigenous African taurine cattle tolerant to trypanosomosis is
   a straightforward approach to control costs generated by this disease. A
   recent study identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying
   trypanotolerance traits in experimental crosses between tolerant N'Dama
   and susceptible Boran zebu cattle. As trypanotolerance is thought to
   result from local adaptation of indigenous cattle breeds, we propose an
   alternative and complementary approach to study the genetic architecture
   of this trait, based on the identification of selection signatures
   within QTL or candidate genes. A panel of 92 microsatellite markers was
   genotyped on 509 cattle belonging to four West African trypanotolerant
   taurine breeds and 10 trypanosusceptible European or African cattle
   breeds. Some of these markers were located within previously identified
   QTL regions or candidate genes, while others were chosen in regions
   assumed to be neutral. A detailed analysis of the genetic structure of
   these different breeds was carried out to confirm a priori grouping of
   populations based on previous data. Tests based on the comparison of the
   observed heterozygosities and variances in microsatellite allelic size
   among trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds led to the
   identification of two significantly less variable microsatellite
   markers. BM4440, one of these two outlier loci, is located within the
   confidence interval of a previously described QTL underlying a
   trypanotolerance-related trait.
   Detection of selection signatures appears to be a straightforward
   approach for unravelling the molecular determinism of trypanosomosis
   pathogenesis. We expect that a whole genome approach will help confirm
   these results and achieve a higher resolving power.}},

Abstract = {{Depletion of polymorphism at major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   genes has been hypothesized to limit the ability of populations to
   respond to emerging pathogens, thus putting their survival at risk. As
   pathogens contribute substantially to the global amphibian decline,
   assessing patterns of MHC variation is important in devising
   conservation strategies. Here, we directly compare levels of MHC class
   II and neutral variation between multiple populations of the great
   crested newt (Triturus cristatus) from refugial (REF: Romania) and
   postglacial expansion (PGE: Germany, Poland and UK) areas. REF
   populations harboured high levels of adaptive variation (24 expressed
   alleles), exhibiting clear signatures of historical positive selection,
   which points to the overall importance of MHC class II variation in this
   species. On the other hand, PGE populations were extremely depauperate
   (two alleles) but nevertheless have survived for c. 10 000 years, since
   the postglacial expansion. Variation in putative MHC class II
   pseudogenes, microsatellites and allozymes also showed a significant
   southern richness-northern purity pattern. The populations in the
   postglacial expansion area thus provide the clearest example to date of
   the long-term survival of populations in which MHC variation,
   historically under positive selection, has been depleted.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Ocean warming will undoubtedly affect the migratory patterns of many
   marine species, but specific changes can be predicted only where
   behavioural mechanisms guiding migration are understood. Southern right
   whales show maternally inherited site fidelity to near-shore winter
   nursery grounds, but exactly where they feed in summer (collectively and
   individually) remains mysterious. They consume huge quantities of
   copepods and krill, and their reproductive rates respond to fluctuations
   in krill abundance linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here
   we show that genetic and isotopic signatures, analysed together,
   indicate maternally directed site fidelity to diverse summer feeding
   grounds for female right whales calving at Peninsula ValdEs, Argentina.
   Isotopic values from 131 skin samples span a broad range (-23.1 to -17.2
   parts per thousand delta C-13, 6.0 to 13.8 parts per thousand delta
   N-15) and are more similar than expected among individuals sharing the
   same mitochondrial haplotype. This pattern indicates that calves learn
   summer feeding locations from their mothers, and that the timescale of
   culturally inherited site fidelity to feeding grounds is at least
   several generations. Such conservatism would be expected to limit the
   exploration of new feeding opportunities, and may explain why this
   population shows increased rates of reproductive failure in years
   following elevated sea-surface temperature anomalies off South Georgia,
   the richest known feeding ground for baleen whales in the South
   Atlantic.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effect of population outbreaks on within and between
   genetic variation of populations in pest species has rarely been
   assessed. In this study, we compare patterns of genetic variation in
   different sets of historically frequently outbreaking and rarely
   outbreaking populations of an agricultural pest of major importance, the
   migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. We analyse genetic variation
   within and between 24 populations at 14 microsatellites in Western
   Europe, where only ancient and low-intensity outbreaks have been
   reported (non-outbreaking populations), and in Madagascar and Northern
   China, where frequent and intense outbreak events have been recorded
   over the last century (outbreaking populations). Our comparative survey
   shows that (i) the long-term effective population size is similar in
   outbreaking and non-outbreaking populations, as evidenced by similar
   estimates of genetic diversity, and (ii) gene flow is substantially
   larger among outbreaking populations than among non-outbreaking
   populations, as evidenced by a fourfold to 30-fold difference in F-ST

Abstract = {{Many aphid species exhibit geographical variation in the mode of
   reproduction that ranges from cyclical parthenogenesis with a sexual
   phase to obligate parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction). Theoretical
   studies predict that organisms reproducing asexually should maintain
   higher allelic diversity per locus but lower genotypic diversity than
   organisms reproducing sexually. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
   evaluated genotypic and allelic diversities in the sexual and asexual
   populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris).
   Microsatellite analysis revealed that populations in central Japan are
   asexual, whereas populations in northern Japan are obligatorily sexual.
   No mixed populations were detected in our study sites. Phylogenetic
   analysis using microsatellite data and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
   subunit I (COI) gene sequences revealed a long history of asexuality in
   central Japan and negated the possibility of the recent origin of the
   asexual populations from the sexual populations. Asexual populations
   exhibited much lower genotypic diversity but higher allelic richness per
   locus than did sexual populations. Asexual populations consisted of a
   few predominant clones that were considerably differentiated from one
   another. Sexual populations on alfalfa, an exotic plant in Japan, were
   most closely related to asexual populations associated with Vicia sativa
   L. The alfalfa-associated sexual populations harboured one COI haplotype
   that was included in the haplotype clade of the asexual populations.
   Available evidence suggests that the sexuality of the alfalfa-associated
   populations has recently been restored through the northward migration
   and colonization of alfalfa by V. sativa-associated lineages. Therefore,
   our results support the theoretical predictions and provide a new
   perspective on the origin of sexual populations.}},

Abstract = {{The deadly poisonous Amanita phalloides is common along the west coast
   of North America. Death cap mushrooms are especially abundant in
   habitats around the San Francisco Bay, California, but the species grows
   as far south as Los Angeles County and north to Vancouver Island,
   Canada. At different times, various authors have considered the species
   as either native or introduced, and the question of whether A.
   phalloides is an invasive species remains unanswered. We developed four
   novel loci and used these in combination with the EF1 alpha and IGS loci
   to explore the phylogeography of the species. The data provide strong
   evidence for a European origin of North American populations. Genetic
   diversity is generally greater in European vs. North American
   populations, suggestive of a genetic bottleneck; polymorphic sites of at
   least two loci are only polymorphic within Europe although the number of
   individuals sampled from Europe was half the number sampled from North
   America. Endemic alleles are not a feature of North American
   populations, although alleles unique to different parts of Europe were
   common and were discovered in Scandinavian, mainland French, and
   Corsican individuals. Many of these endemic European haplotypes were
   found together at single sites in California. Early collections of A.
   phalloides dated prior to 1963 and annotated using sequences of the ITS
   locus proved to be different species of Amanita. The first Californian
   collections that we confirmed as A. phalloides were made from the Del
   Monte Hotel (now the Naval Postgraduate School) in Monterey, and on the
   campus of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1938 and in 1945.
   These historical data are used in combination with data on A.
   phalloides' current distribution to estimate a rate of spread for A.
   phalloides in California. Many species of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi
   have been introduced across and among continents, but with this
   evidence, the death cap becomes the only known invasive EM fungus in
   North America.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Sex-chromosomes are thought to play an important role in speciation, but
   few studies of non-model organisms have investigated the relative
   influence of multiple sex-linked markers on reproductive isolation. We
   collected 222 individuals along a geographical transect spanning the
   hybrid zone between Passerina amoena and P. cyanea (Aves: Cardinalidae).
   Using maximum-likelihood cline fitting methods, we estimated
   locus-specific introgression rates for 10 z-linked markers. Although the
   cline width estimates ranged from 2.8 to 584 km, eight of 10 loci had
   cline widths between 224 and 271 km. We also used coalescent-based
   estimates of locus-specific divergence times between P. amoena and P.
   cyanea to test a recently proposed hypothesis of an inverse relationship
   between divergence time and cline width but did not find a significant
   association. The narrow width (2.8 km) of the cline estimated from the
   VLDLR9 locus indicates strong selection retarding introgression of
   alleles at this locus across the hybrid zone. Interestingly, a mutation
   in the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) gene, in which
   VLDLR9 is an intron, is known to reduce the egg-laying ability of some
   chickens, suggesting a possible link between this gene region and
   reproductive isolation between P. amoena and P. cyanea. These results
   underscore the importance of sampling multiple loci to investigate
   introgression patterns across a chromosome or genome and support
   previous findings of the importance of sex-linked genes in speciation.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The geology and climate of the western Mediterranean area were strongly
   modified during the Late Tertiary and the Quaternary. These geological
   and climatic events are thought to have induced changes in the
   population histories of plants in the Iberian Peninsula. However,
   fine-scale genetic spatial architecture across western Mediterranean
   steppe plant refugia has rarely been investigated. A population genetic
   analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism variation was
   conducted on present-day, relict populations of Ferula loscosii
   (Apiaceae). This species exhibits high individual/population numbers in
   the middle Ebro river valley and, according to the hypothesis of an
   abundant-centre distribution, these northern populations might represent
   a long-standing/ancestral distribution centre. However, our results
   suggest that the decimated southern and central Iberian populations are
   more variable and structured than the northeastern ones, representing
   the likely vestiges of an ancestral distribution centre of the species.
   Phylogeographical analysis suggests that F. loscosii likely originated
   in southern Spain and then migrated towards the central and northeastern
   ranges, further supporting a Late Miocene southern-bound Mediterranean
   migratory way for its oriental steppe ancestors. In addition, different
   glacial-induced conditions affected the southern and northern steppe
   Iberian refugia during the Quaternary. The contrasting genetic
   homogeneity of the Ebro valley range populations compared to the
   southern Iberian ones possibly reflects more severe bottlenecks and
   subsequent genetic drift experienced by populations of the northern
   Iberia refugium during the Pleistocene, followed by successful
   postglacial expansion from only a few founder plants.}},

Abstract = {{Instances of hybridization between endemic and alien species pose a
   threat to species integrity but also provide us with an opportunity to
   study the dynamics of gene flow between two species as they first meet.
   Here, we used variation at 22 highly differentiated microsatellite loci
   and one mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker in a sample of 735 individuals,
   to investigate the genetic consequences of an introduction of Japanese
   sika deer (Cervus nippon) for native red deer (C. elaphus) on the
   Kintyre Peninsula in Scotland. We investigated population structure,
   estimated null-allele frequency and assigned individual hybrid scores
   using a Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in structure 2.2. The
   dataset clearly divided into two clusters and generally, introgression
   into red and sika was low. However at one site, West Loch Awe, 43\% of
   individuals were hybrids. MtDNA introgression indicated that
   hybridization was occurring between red-deer hinds and sika-deer stags.
   We argue that the pattern of differential introgression across the study
   area is primarily due to the rarity of hybridization events between the
   two species and the limited time the two species have been in contact (<
   120 years). This contrasts with the causes of classic mosaic hybrid
   zones (selection induced by habitat variability). Currently, it seems
   possible that, in time, the level of hybridization found at West Loch
   Awe could also be found across the whole of the peninsula.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization is an important cause of abrupt speciation. Hybrid
   speciation without a change in ploidy (homoploid hybrid speciation) is
   well-established in plants but has also been reported in animals and
   fungi. A notable example of recent homoploid hybrid speciation is
   Senecio squalidus (Oxford ragwort), which originated in the UK in the
   18th Century following introduction of hybrid material from a hybrid
   zone between S. chrysanthemifolius and S. aethnensis on Mount Etna,
   Sicily. To investigate genetic divergence between these taxa, we used
   complementary DNA microarrays to compare patterns of floral gene
   expression. These analyses revealed major differences in gene expression
   between the parent species and wild and resynthesized S. squalidus.
   Comparisons of gene expression between S. aethnensis, S.
   chrysanthemifolius and natural S. squalidus identified genes potentially
   involved in local environmental adaptation. The analysis also revealed
   non-additive patterns of gene expression in the hybrid relative to its
   progenitors. These expression changes were more dramatic and widespread
   in resynthesized hybrids than in natural S. squalidus, suggesting that a
   unique expression pattern may have been fixed during the allopatric
   divergence of British S. squalidus. We speculate that
   hybridization-induced gene-expression change may provide an immediate
   source of novel phenotypic variation upon which selection can act to
   facilitate homoploid hybrid speciation in plants.}},

Title = {{Pleistocene phylogeography and phylogenetic concordance in cold-adapted
   spring snails (Bythinella spp.)}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{890-903}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies on Pleistocene phylogeography of European taxa are
   biased towards (i) vertebrates, (ii) terrestrial taxa, (iii) single
   species, and (iv) taxa that survived the Pleistocene in southern
   refugia. Relatively little is known about whether evolutionary patterns
   of vertebrate and terrestrial taxa are also applicable to freshwater
   invertebrates, whether cold-adapted freshwater species could survive in
   extensive permafrost areas without retreating into refugia, and whether
   Pleistocene phylogeographical patterns are influenced by phylogeny.
   Here, the widespread and species-rich European spring snail genus
   Bythinella Moquin-Tandon, 1856 is utilized in an attempt to mitigate
   this bias. These strongly cold-adapted freshwater animals mostly occur
   in springs - highly isolated habitats that are relatively unaffected by
   anthropogenic influences. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses
   based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA sequence data were conducted
   in 458 specimens from 142 populations occurring throughout Europe. The
   study provides evidence that most Bythinella spp. survived the
   Pleistocene in restricted northern glacial refugia that largely
   correspond to refugia previously recognized for other European biota.
   However, survival of Bythinella spp. in extensive permafrost areas
   outside of refugia can likely be rejected. Low dispersal ability and the
   isolation and fragmentation of spring habitats, as well as the
   distribution of perennial springs within permafrost regions, may account
   for this result. Tests involving a total of 29 nominal species showed
   that phylogenetically closely related Bythinella species did not occupy
   similar refugia. This lack of phylogenetic concordance could possibly be
   explained by the stochasticity of survival and dispersal in spring
   snails.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary glacial cycles have played an important role in shaping the
   biodiversity in temperate regions. This is well documented in Northern
   Hemisphere, but much less understood for Southern Hemisphere. We used
   mitochondrial DNA and nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha intron sequences
   to examine the Pleistocene glacial impacts on the phylogeographical
   pattern of the freshwater crab Aegla alacalufi in Chilean Patagonia.
   Phylogenetic analyses, which separated the glaciated populations on
   eastern continent into a north group (seven populations) and a south
   group (one population), revealed a shallow phylogenetic structure in the
   north group but a deep one in the non-glaciated populations on western
   islands, indicating the significant influence of glaciation on these
   populations. Phylogenies also identified the Yaldad population on ChiloE
   Island as a potentially unrecognized new species. The non-glaciated
   populations showed higher among population genetic divergence than the
   glaciated ones, but lower population genetic diversity was not detected
   in the latter. The two glaciated groups, which diverged from the
   non-glaciated populations at similar to 96 800-29 500 years ago and
   similar to 104 200-73 800 years ago, respectively, seem to have
   different glacial refugia. Unexpectedly, the non-glaciated islands did
   not serve as refugia for them. Demographic expansion was detected in the
   glaciated north group, with a constant population increase after the
   last glacial maximum. Nested clade analyses suggest a possible
   colonization from western islands to eastern continent. After arriving
   on the continent and surviving the last glacial period there,
   populations likely have expanded from high to low altitude, following
   the flood of melting ice. Aegla alacalufi genetic diversity has been
   primarily affected by Pleistocene glaciation and minimally by drainage
   isolation.}},

Abstract = {{The Galician sympatric ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis have been
   proposed as a model system for studying parallel ecological speciation.
   Such a model system makes a clear prediction: candidate loci (for
   divergent adaptation) should present a higher level of geographical
   differentiation than noncandidate (neutral) loci. We used 2356 amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and four microsatellite loci to
   identify candidate loci for ecological adaptation using the F(ST)
   outlier method. Three per cent of the studied AFLP loci were identified
   as candidate loci associated with adaptation, after multitest
   adjustments, thus contributing to ecotype differentiation (candidate
   loci were not detected within ecotypes). Candidate and noncandidate loci
   were analysed separately at four different F(ST) partitions: differences
   between ecotypes (overall and local), differences between localities and
   micro-geographical differences within ecotypes. The magnitude of F(ST)
   differed between candidate and noncandidate loci for all partitions
   except in the case of microgeographical differentiation within ecotypes,
   and the microsatellites (putatively neutral) showed an identical pattern
   to noncandidate loci. Thus, variation in candidate loci is determined
   partially independent by divergent natural selection (in addition to
   stochastic forces) at each locality, while noncandidate loci are
   exclusively driven by stochastic forces. These results support the
   evolutionary history described for these particular populations,
   considered to be a clear example of incomplete sympatric ecological
   speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed high local diversity and endemism in
   groundwaters, and showed that species with large ranges are extremely
   rare. One of such species is the cave shrimp Troglocaris anophthalmus
   from the Dinaric Karst on the western Balkan Peninsula, apparently
   uniform across a range of more than 500 kilometres. As such it
   contradicts the paradigm that subterranean organisms form localized,
   long-term stable populations that cannot disperse over long distances.
   We tested it for possible cryptic diversity and/or unexpected
   evolutionary processes, analysing mitochondrial (COI, 16S rRNA) and
   nuclear (ITS2) genes of 232 specimens from the entire range. The results
   of an array of phylogeographical procedures congruently suggested that
   the picture of a widespread, continuously distributed and homogenous T.
   anophthalmus was wrong. The taxon is composed of four or possibly five
   monophyletic, geographically defined phylogroups that meet several
   species delimitation criteria, two of them showing evidence of
   biological reproductive isolation in sympatry. COI genetic distances
   between phylogroups turned out to be a poor predictor, as they were much
   lower than the sometimes suggested crustacean threshold value of 0.16
   substitutions per site. Most results confirmed the nondispersal
   hypothesis of subterranean fauna, but the southern Adriatic phylogroup
   displayed a paradoxical pattern of recent dispersal across 300
   kilometres of hydrographically fragmented karst terrain. We suggest a
   model of migration under extreme water-level conditions, when flooded
   poljes could act as stepping-stones. In the north of the range
   (Slovenia), the results confirmed the existence of a zone of unique
   biogeographical conflict, where surface fauna is concordant with the
   current watershed, and subterranean fauna is not.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Neotropical freshwater fishes have reached an unrivalled diversity,
   organized into several areas of endemism, yet the underlying processes
   are still largely unknown. The topographical and ecological
   characteristics of the Guyanas Region make it an ideal area of endemism
   in which to investigate the forces that have shaped this great
   diversity. This region is thought to be inhabited by species descending
   from Amazonian ancestors, which would have used two documented routes
   that, however, hardly explain the entrance of species adapted to running
   waters. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of Pseudancistrus
   brevispinis, a catfish endemic to this region and exclusively found in
   running waters, thus making it an ideal model for investigating
   colonization routes and dispersal in such habitats. Our analyses, based
   on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, revealed an unexpected diversity
   consisting of six monophyletic lineages within P. brevispinis, showing a
   disjoint distribution pattern. The lineages endemic to Guyanas coastal
   rivers form a monophyletic group that originated via an ancestral
   colonization event from the Amazon basin. Evidence given favours a
   colonization pathway through river capture between an Amazonian
   tributary and the Upper Maroni River. Population genetic analyses of the
   most widespread species indicate that subsequent dispersal among Guyanas
   coastal rivers occurred principally by temporary connections between
   adjacent rivers during periods of lower sea level, yet instances of
   dispersal via interbasin river captures are not excluded. During high
   sea level intervals, the isolated populations would have diverged
   leading to the observed allopatric species. This evolutionary process is
   named the sea level fluctuation (SLF) hypothesis of diversification.}},

Abstract = {{Strong currents and deep passages of water can be barriers for larval
   dispersal of continental marine animals, but potential effects on direct
   developers are under-investigated. We examined the genetic structure of
   Doris kerguelenensis, a directly developing sea slug that occurs across
   the Drake Passage, the body of water separating Antarctica from South
   America. We found deep mitochondrial divergences within populations on
   both sides of the Drake Passage, and South American animals formed
   multiple sister-group relationships with Antarctic animals. A
   generalised molecular clock suggested these trans-Drake pairs diverged
   during the Pliocene-Pleistocene, after the formation of the Drake
   Passage. Statistical parsimony methods recovered 29 separate haplotype
   networks (many sympatric) that likely correlate with allopatric events
   caused by repeated glacial cycles. Data from 16S were congruent but more
   conserved than COI, and the estimated ancestral 16S haplotype was
   widespread. The marked difference in the substitution rates between
   these two mitochondrial genes results in different estimates of
   connectivity. Demographic analyses on networks revealed some evidence
   for selection and expanding populations. Contrasting with the Northern
   Hemisphere, glaciation in Antarctica appears to have increased rather
   than reduced genetic diversity. This suggests orbitally forced range
   dynamics based on Northern Hemisphere phylogeography do not hold for
   Antarctica. The diverse lineages found in D. kerguelenensis point
   towards a recent, explosive radiation, likely reflecting multiple
   refuges during glaciation events, combined with limited subsequent
   dispersal. Whether recognised as cryptic species or not, genetic
   diversity in Antarctic marine invertebrates appears higher than expected
   from morphological analyses, and supports the Antarctic biodiversity
   pump phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons of nematode communities among ecosystems have indicated
   that, unlike many organisms, nematode communities have less diversity in
   the tropics than in temperate ecosystems. There are, however, few
   studies of tropical nematode diversity on which to base conclusions of
   global patterns of diversity. This study reports an attempt to estimate
   nematode diversity in the lowland tropical rainforest of La Selva
   Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. We suggest one reason that
   previous estimates of tropical nematode diversity were low is because
   habitats above the mineral soil are seldom sampled. As much as 62\% of
   the overall genetic diversity, measured by an 18S ribosomal barcode,
   existed in litter and understorey habitats and not in soil. A
   maximum-likelihood tree of barcodes from 360 individual nematodes
   indicated most major terrestrial nematode lineages were represented in
   the samples. Estimated `species' richness ranged from 464 to 502 within
   the four 40 x 40 m plots. Directed sampling of insects and their
   associated nematodes produced a second set of barcodes that were not
   recovered by habitat sampling, yet may constitute a major class of
   tropical nematode diversity. While the generation of novel nematode
   barcodes proved relatively easy, their identity remains obscure due to
   deficiencies in existing taxonomic databases. Specimens of
   Criconematina, a monophyletic group of soil-dwelling plant-parasitic
   nematodes were examined in detail to assess the steps necessary for
   associating barcodes with nominal species. Our results highlight the
   difficulties associated with studying poorly understood organisms in an
   understudied ecosystem using a destructive (i.e. barcode) sampling

Abstract = {{Ants are some of the most abundant and ecologically successful
   terrestrial organisms, and invasive ants rank among the most damaging
   invasive species. The Argentine ant is a particularly well-studied
   invader, in part because of the extreme social structure of introduced
   populations, known as unicoloniality. Unicolonial ants form
   geographically vast supercolonies, within which territorial behaviour
   and intraspecific aggression are absent. Because the extreme social
   structure of introduced populations arises from the widespread
   acceptance of conspecifics, understanding how this colonymate
   recognition occurs is key to explaining their success as invaders. Here,
   we present analyses of Argentine ant recognition cues (cuticular
   hydrocarbons) and population genetic characteristics from 25 sites
   across four continents and the Hawaiian Islands. By examining both
   hydrocarbon profiles and microsatellite genotypes in the same individual
   ants, we show that native and introduced populations differ in several
   respects. Both individual workers and groups of nestmates in the
   introduced range possess less diverse chemical profiles than ants in the
   native range. As previous studies have reported, we also find that
   introduced populations possess much lower levels of genetic diversity
   than populations in the native range. Interestingly, the largest
   supercolonies on several continents are strikingly similar to each
   other, suggesting that they arose from a shared introduction pathway.
   This high similarity suggests that these geographically far-flung ants
   may still recognize and accept each other as colonymates, thus
   representing distant nodes of a single, widely distributed supercolony.
   These findings shed light on the behaviour and sociality of these
   unicolonial invaders, and pose new questions about the history and
   origins of introduced populations.}},

Abstract = {{Larval settlement is a vital transition period for marine invertebrates
   and can have far-reaching effects on the ecology and evolution of a
   species. To explore the molecular mechanisms of this critical process in
   a nonmodel organism, the abalone Haliotis asinina, we employed cDNA
   microarrays. By comparing gene expression profiles through mid- to late
   larval development and metamorphosis, we identified 144 genes as
   candidates for a role in competence and/or metamorphosis. Gene
   characterization indicates similar to 60\% of these are significantly
   similar to known genes from other taxa, while similar to 40\% are novel.
   A high 49.3\% of genes are gastropod or abalone specific, but none
   appears to be Lophotrochozoan specific, even though metamorphosis is
   thought to have had a separate origin in this group. Differentially
   expressed larval and postlarval genes can be clustered into five
   categories that reveal strikingly different temporal transcriptional
   patterns occurring during this phase of development. Some gene
   activation is contingent upon exogenous cues and correlates with
   initiation of settlement. Importantly, there is also extensive gene
   activity associated with the endogenous attainment of competence, which
   occurs before, and independent of, the exogenous induction of
   settlement. Our results show that as the haliotid veliger larva matures,
   it requires coordinated regulation of temporally different batteries of
   genes involved in a wide range of physiological and developmental
   processes associated with benthic colonization. Although the signalling
   pathways operating at metamorphosis may be conserved across the animal
   kingdom, it appears they regulate the expression of novel genes specific
   to abalone, gastropods and molluscs during H. asinina metamorphosis.}},

Abstract = {{The negative relationship between temperature and geographical variation
   in body size, or Bergmann's rule, is among the most thoroughly studied
   ecogeographical rules, yet the pattern and process underlying it remain
   controversial. Bergmann's original observations were of body size clines

   recognition that both Bergmann's rule and its reverse occur in many
   ectotherm taxa. A new study of syngnathid fish by Wilson (2009) in this
   issue of Molecular Ecology sheds light on intriguing alternative
   mechanisms that may explain variation in the direction of body size
   clines across taxa. Wilson shows that Bergmann's rule is found in
   pipefish of the genus Syngnathus, but not in seahorses of the genus
   Hippocampus. His results suggest that polygamy in pipefish allows
   fecundity selection to favour large size at low temperatures,
   compensating for increases in brooding time.}},

Abstract = {{Cryobanking, the freezing of biological specimens to maintain their
   integrity for a variety of anticipated and unanticipated uses, offers
   unique opportunities to advance the basic knowledge of biological
   systems and their evolution. Notably, cryobanking provides a crucial
   opportunity to support conservation efforts for endangered species.
   Historically, cryobanking has been developed mostly in response to human
   economic and medical needs - these needs must now be extended to
   biodiversity conservation. Reproduction technologies utilizing
   cryobanked gametes, embryos and somatic cells are already vital
   components of endangered species recovery efforts. Advances in modern
   biological research (e.g. stem cell research, genomics and proteomics)
   are already drawing heavily on cryobanked specimens, and future needs
   are anticipated to be immense. The challenges of developing and applying
   cryobanking for a broader diversity of species were addressed at an
   international conference held at Trier University (Germany) in June
   2008. However, the magnitude of the potential benefits of cryobanking
   stood in stark contrast to the lack of substantial resources available
   for this area of strategic interest for biological science - and society
   at large. The meeting at Trier established a foundation for a strong
   global incentive to cryobank threatened species. The establishment of an
   Amphibian Ark cryobanking programme offers the first opportunity for
   global cooperation to achieve the cryobanking of the threatened species
   from an entire vertebrate class.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In conventional phylogeographic studies, historical demographic
   processes are elucidated from the geographical distribution of
   individuals represented on an inferred gene tree. However, the
   interpretation of gene trees in this context can be difficult as the
   same demographic/geographical process can randomly lead to multiple
   different genealogies. Likewise, the same gene trees can arise under
   different demographic models. This problem has led to the emergence of
   many statistical methods for making phylogeographic inferences. A
   popular phylogeographic approach based on nested clade analysis is
   challenged by the fact that a certain amount of the interpretation of
   the data is left to the subjective choices of the user, and it has been
   argued that the method performs poorly in simulation studies. More
   rigorous statistical methods based on coalescence theory have been
   developed. However, these methods may also be challenged by
   computational problems or poor model choice. In this review, we will
   describe the development of statistical methods in phylogeographic
   analysis, and discuss some of the challenges facing these methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel and straightforward method for estimating recent
   migration rates between discrete populations using multilocus genotype
   data. The approach builds upon a two-step sampling design, where
   individual genotypes are sampled before and after dispersal. We develop
   a model that estimates all pairwise backwards migration rates (m(ij),
   the probability that an individual sampled in population i is a migrant
   from population j) between a set of populations. The method is validated
   with simulated data and compared with the methods of BayesAss and
   Structure. First, we use data for an island model and then we consider
   more realistic data simulations for a metapopulation of the greater
   white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula). We show that the precision and
   bias of estimates primarily depend upon the proportion of individuals
   sampled in each population. Weak sampling designs may particularly
   affect the quality of the coverage provided by 95\% highest posterior
   density intervals. We further show that it is relatively insensitive to
   the number of loci sampled and the overall strength of genetic
   structure. The method can easily be extended and makes fewer assumptions
   about the underlying demographic and genetic processes than currently
   available methods. It allows backwards migration rates to be estimated
   across a wide range of realistic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent success in breeding giant pandas in captivity has encouraged
   panda conservationists to believe that the ex situ population is ready
   to serve as a source for supporting the wild population. In this study,
   we used 11 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the amount and
   distribution of genetic variability present in the two largest captive
   populations (Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan
   Province and the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant
   Panda at Wolong, Sichuan Province). The data were compared with those
   samples from wild pandas living in two key giant panda nature reserves
   (Baoxing Nature Reserve and Wanglang Nature Reserve). The results show
   that the captive populations have retained lower levels of allelic
   diversity and heterozygosity compared to isolated wild populations.
   However, low inbreeding coefficients indicate that captive populations
   are under careful genetic management. Excessive heterozygosity suggests
   that the two captive populations have experienced a genetic bottleneck,
   presumably caused by founder effects. Moreover, evidence of increased
   genetic divergence demonstrates restricted breeding options within
   facilities. Based on these results, we conclude that the genetic
   diversity in the captive populations is not optimal. Introduction of
   genetic materials from wild pandas and improved exchange of genetic
   materials among institutions will be necessary for the captive pandas to
   be representative of the wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{In Belgium, the Pelophylax esculentus complex has recently been
   subjected to multiple introductions of non-native water frogs,
   increasing the occurrence of hybridisation events. In the present study,
   we tested the reliability of morphometric and recently developed
   microsatellite tools to identify introgression and to determine the
   origin of exotic Belgian water frogs. By analysing 150 individuals of
   each taxon of the P. esculentus complex and an additional 60 specimens
   of the introduced P. cf. bedriagae, we show that neither of the
   currently available tools appears to have sufficient power to reliably
   distinguish all Belgian water frog species. We therefore aimed at
   increasing the discriminatory power of a microsatellite identification
   tool by developing a new marker panel with additional microsatellite
   loci. By adding only two new microsatellite loci (RlCA5 and RlCA1b20),
   all taxa of the P. esculentus complex could be distinguished from each
   other with high confidence. Three more loci (Res3, Res5 and Res17)
   provided a powerful discrimination of the exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the spatial structure of a population is critical for
   effective assessment and management. However, direct observation of
   spatial dynamics is generally difficult, particularly for marine
   mammals. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are polygynous
   pinnipeds distributed along the Pacific coast of North America. The
   species' range has been subdivided into three management stocks based on
   differences in mitochondrial DNA, but to date no studies have considered
   nuclear genetic variation, and thus we lack a comprehensive
   understanding of gene flow patterns among sea lion colonies. In light of
   recent population declines in the Gulf of California, Mexico, it is
   important to understand spatial structure to determine if declining sea
   lion colonies are genetically isolated from others. To define population
   subdivision and identify sex biases in gene flow, we analysed a 355-bp
   sequence of the mitochondrial DNA control region and 10 polymorphic
   microsatellite loci from 355 tissue samples collected from six colonies
   distributed along Mexican waters. Using a novel approach to estimate sex
   biases in gene flow, we found that male sea lions disperse on average
   6.75 times more frequently than females. Analyses of population
   subdivision strongly suggest a pattern of isolation by distance among
   colonies and challenge current stock definitions. Based on these
   results, we propose an alternative classification that identifies three
   Mexican management units: Upper Gulf of California, Southern Baja
   Peninsula, and Upper Pacific Coast of Baja. This revised classification
   should be considered in future assessment and management of California
   sea lion populations in Mexican waters.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of species should be based on knowledge of effective
   population sizes and understanding of how breeding tactics and selection
   of recruitment habitats lead to genetic structuring. In the
   stream-spawning and genetically diverse brown trout, spawning and
   rearing areas may be restricted source habitats. Spatio-temporal genetic
   variability patterns were studied in brown trout occupying three lakes
   characterized by restricted stream habitat but high recruitment levels.
   This suggested non-typical lake-spawning, potentially representing
   additional spatio-temporal genetic variation in continuous habitats.
   Three years of sampling documented presence of young-of-the-year cohorts
   in littoral lake areas with groundwater inflow, confirming lake-spawning
   trout in all three lakes. Nine microsatellite markers assayed across 901
   young-of-the-year individuals indicated overall substantial genetic
   differentiation in space and time. Nested gene diversity analyses
   revealed highly significant (<= P = 0.002) differentiation on all
   hierarchical levels, represented by regional lakes (F(LT) = 0.281),
   stream vs. lake habitat within regional lakes (F(HL) = 0.045), sample
   site within habitats (F(SH) = 0.010), and cohorts within sample sites
   (F(CS) = 0.016). Genetic structuring was, however, different among
   lakes. It was more pronounced in a natural lake, which exhibited
   temporally stable structuring both between two lake-spawning populations
   and between lake- and stream spawners. Hence, it is demonstrated that
   lake-spawning brown trout form genetically distinct populations and may
   significantly contribute to genetic diversity. In another lake,
   differentiation was substantial between stream- and lake-spawning
   populations but not within habitat. In the third lake, there was less
   apparent spatial or temporal genetic structuring. Calculation of
   effective population sizes suggested small spawning populations in
   general, both within streams and lakes, and indicates that the presence
   of lake-spawning populations tended to reduce genetic drift in the total
   (meta-) population of the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the processes maintaining genetic variability in wild
   populations is a major concern in conservation and evolutionary biology.
   Parasite-mediated selection may strongly affect genetic variability in
   wild populations. The inbreeding depression theory predicts that
   directional selection imposed by parasites should act against the most
   inbred hosts, thus favouring genetic diversity in wild populations. We
   have tested this prediction by evaluating the strength and shape of the
   relationship between the load of a harmful fin-feeder ectoparasite
   (Tracheliastes polycolpus) and the genome-wide genetic diversity (i.e.
   heterozygosity measured at a set of 15 microsatellites) of its fish
   host, the rostrum dace (Leuciscus leuciscus). Contrary to expectation,
   we found a nonlinear relationship between host genetic diversity and
   ectoparasite load, with hosts that were either homozygous or
   heterozygous harbouring significantly fewer parasites than hosts with an
   intermediate level of heterozygosity. This relationship suggests that
   parasites could increase the variance of global heterozygosity in this
   host population through disruptive selection on genetic diversity.
   Moreover, when genetic diversity was measured at each locus separately,
   we found two very strong positive associations between host genetic
   diversity and the ectoparasite load. This latter result has three main
   implications: (i) genome-wide effect cannot alone explain the nonlinear
   relationship between global heterozygosity and ectoparasite load, (ii)
   negative non-additive allelic interactions (i.e. underdominance) may be
   a mechanism for resisting ectoparasite infection, and (iii)
   ectoparasites may favour homozygosity at some loci in this host
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of sex is still a major unsolved puzzle in biology. One of
   the most promising theoretical models to answer this question is the Red
   Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis proposes a fast adaptation of
   pathogens to common genotypes and therefore a negative
   frequency-dependent selection against common genotypes. Clonal organisms
   should be especially endangered when co-occurring with closely related
   sexual species. In this context, major histocompatibility (MHC) genes
   have been discussed to be auspicious candidates that could provide the
   genetic basis on which selection for immune competence could act. In
   this study, we investigated MHC variability in a clonal teleost fish:
   the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa. The Amazon molly is an ideal
   candidate to test the Red Queen hypothesis as it is a clonal species but
   co-occurs with a closely related sexual species and should therefore be
   especially susceptible to pathogen infection. We found that allele
   numbers did in general not differ between sexual and clonal `species'
   but that genotypic variability is reduced in the clonally reproducing
   fish, especially in the polyploids. We conclude that in clonal
   organisms, genotype frequency might be more important for immune
   competence than MHC allele number. Amazon mollies and their co-occurring
   parental species clearly fulfil a prerequisite of the Red Queen
   hypothesis and should therefore provide an ideal system to
   experimentally test this basic principle probably underlying the
   evolution of sex.}},

   drought occurred during the last two years and differentially affected
   the study sites. This allowed us to test the effect of natural
   disturbances on changes in both genetic and species diversity. Overall,
   local (alpha) diversity declined as reflected by lower values of gene
   diversity H-S and evenness. In parallel, the among-sites (beta)
   diversity increased at both the genetic (F-ST) and species (F-STC)

Title = {{Population genetic structure of diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic
   hawthorns (Crataegus; Rosaceae) in the Pacific Northwest}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidy and gametophytic apomixis are two important and associated
   processes in plants. Many hawthorn species are polyploids and can
   reproduce both sexually and apomictically. However, the population
   genetic structure of these species is poorly understood. Crataegus
   douglasii is represented exclusively by self-compatible tetraploid
   pseudogamous apomicts across North America, whereas Crataegus suksdorfii
   found in the Pacific Northwest is known to include self-incompatible
   diploid sexuals as well as polyploid apomicts. We compare population
   structure and genetic variability in these two closely related taxa
   using microsatellite and chloroplast sequence markers. Using 13
   microsatellite loci located on four linkage groups, 251 alleles were
   detected in 239 individuals sampled from 15 localities.
   Within-population multilocus genotypic variation and molecular diversity
   are greatest in diploid sexuals and lowest in triploid apomicts. Apart
   from the isolation of eastern North American populations of C.
   douglasii, there is little evidence of isolation by distance in this
   taxon. Genetic diversity in western populations of C. douglasii suggests
   that gene flow is frequent, and that colonization and establishment are
   often successful. In contrast, local populations of C. suksdorfii are
   more markedly differentiated. Gene flow appears to be limited primarily
   by distance in diploids and by apomixis and self-compatibility in
   polyploids. We infer that apomixis and reproductive barriers between
   cytotypes are factors that reduce the frequency of gene flow among
   populations, and may ultimately lead to allopatric speciation in C.
   suksdorfii. Our findings shed light on evolution in woody plants that
   show heterogeneous ploidy levels and reproductive systems.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Phytophthora includes some of the most destructive plant
   pathogens affecting agricultural and native ecosystems and is
   responsible for a number of recent emerging and re-emerging infectious
   diseases of plants. Sudden oak death, caused by the exotic pathogen P.
   ramorum, has caused extensive mortality of oaks and tanoaks in Northern
   California, and has brought economic losses to US and European nurseries
   as well due to its infection of common ornamental plants. In its known
   range, P. ramorum occurs as three distinct clonal lineages. We inferred
   the evolutionary history of P. ramorum from nuclear sequence data using
   coalescent-based approaches. We found that the three lineages have been
   diverging for at least 11\% of their history, an evolutionarily
   significant amount of time estimated to be on the order of 165 000 to
   500 000 years. There was also strong evidence for historical
   recombination between the lineages, indicating that the ancestors of the
   P. ramorum lineages were members of a sexually reproducing population.
   Due to this recombination, the ages of the lineages varied within and
   between loci, but coalescent analyses suggested that the European
   lineage may be older than the North American lineages. The divergence of
   the three clonal lineages of P. ramorum supports a scenario in which the
   three lineages originated from different geographic locations that were
   sufficiently isolated from each other to allow independent evolution
   prior to introduction to North America and Europe. It is thus probable
   that the emergence of P. ramorum in North America and Europe was the
   result of three independent migration events.}},

Abstract = {{The release of domesticated organisms into natural populations may
   adversely affect these populations through predation, resource
   competition, and the introduction of disease. Additionally, the
   potential for hybridization between wild and domestic conspecifics is of
   great concern because it can alter the evolutionary integrity of the
   affected populations. Wild American mink (Neovison vison) populations
   may be threatened not only by competition for resources with domestic
   mink originating from farms, but by breeding with such escapees. Using
   10 microsatellite loci, we genotyped mink from Ontario, Canada, sampled
   from two farms, two putatively mixed populations in regions surrounding
   the mink farms, and two wild populations with no recent history of mink
   farming. Using individual-based Bayesian population assignment, we
   identified four population clusters, including one wild, and three
   domestic populations. The latter were not clustered by farm but rather
   by distinct line-bred colour phases. Population clustering also
   identified domestic and hybrid mink in the free-ranging populations.
   Nearly two-thirds of the mink sampled in the two putatively mixed
   populations (78\% and 43\%) were either farm escapees or descendants of
   escapees. Principal components analysis of allele frequencies supported
   our Bayesian assignment results. The power of our assignment test was
   assessed using simulated hybrid genotypes which suggested that our
   overall correct classification rate was 96.2\%. The overwhelming
   presence of domestic animals and their hybridization with mink in
   natural populations is of great concern for the future sustainability of
   wild mink populations.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms with wide geographical or phenotypic diversity often
   constitute assemblages of genetically distinct species or lineages.
   Within parasites, an emergence of host-specific lineages is assumed to
   create such cryptic variability; however, empirical evaluation of these
   processes is scarce. Here, we analyse populations of a parasite with a
   complex life cycle, wide host spectrum and global distribution, with the
   aim to reveal factors underlying the evolution of host- or
   geography-dependent lineages. Using 15 microsatellite loci, deep genetic
   distances were observed between populations from distant geographical
   areas. On the local scale, host-mediated genetic structure was found
   among sympatric samples. Two lineages differing in the spectrum of
   infected hosts co-occurred in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and two
   distinct lineages were recovered from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Although
   sampled across several host taxa and multiple localities, a lack of
   marked genetic structure was seen in the populations belonging to one of
   the European lineages. Only weak genetic differentiation between
   sympatric samples from two host species was found. Complexity of the
   parasite life-cycle contributed to such a stratified pattern.
   Differences in the immune response between fish hosts were suggested as
   the factor diversifying the populations locally; conversely, high
   mobility of the parasite due to migration with its bird (definitive)
   host were assessed to homogenize populations across the area of
   distribution. However, despite the high mobility, large bodies of salt
   water prevent the parasite from long-distance migrations, as was
   demonstrated in an example of the Mediterranean Sea which represented an
   effective barrier to gene flow.}},

Title = {{A powerful regression-based method for admixture mapping of isolation

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1207-1224}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel method that uses natural admixture between divergent
   lineages (hybridization) to investigate the genetic architecture of
   reproductive isolation and adaptive introgression. Our method employs
   multinomial regression to estimate genomic clines and to quantify
   introgression for individual loci relative to the genomic background
   (clines in genotype frequency along a genomic admixture gradient). Loci
   with patterns of introgression that deviate significantly from null
   expectations based on the remainder of the genome are potentially
   subject to selection and thus of interest to understanding adaptation
   and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using simulations, we show
   that different forms of selection modify these genomic clines in
   predictable ways and that our method has good power to detect moderate
   to strong selection for multiple forms of selection. Using
   individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our method generally
   has a low false positive rate, except when genetic drift is particularly
   pronounced (e.g. low population size, low migration rates from parental
   populations, and substantial time since initial admixture). Additional
   individual-based simulations reveal that moderate selection against
   heterozygotes can be detected as much as 50 cm away from the focal locus
   directly experiencing selection, but is not detected at unlinked loci.
   Finally, we apply our analytical method to previously published data
   sets from a mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and two sunflower
   (Helianthus petiolaris and H. annuus) hybrid zones. This method should
   be applicable to numerous species that are currently the focus of
   research in evolution and ecology and should help bring about new
   insights regarding the processes underlying the origin and maintenance
   of biological diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, cave bears were believed to have only inhabited Europe.
   However, recent morphological evidence suggests that cave bears'
   geographic range extended as far east as Transbaikalia, Eastern Siberia.
   These Asian cave bears were morphologically distinct from European cave
   bears. However, how they related to European lineages remains unclear,
   stressing the need to assess the phylogenetic and phylogeographic
   relationship between Asian cave bears and their European relatives. In
   this work, we address this issue using a 227 base-pair fragment of the
   mitochondrial control region obtained from nine fossil bone samples from
   eight sites from the Urals, Caucasus, Altai Mountains, Ukraine and Yana
   River region in Eastern Siberia. Results of the phylogenetic analyses
   indicate that (i) the cave bear from the Yana River is most closely
   related to cave bears from the Caucasus region; (ii) the Caucasus/Yana
   group of bears is genetically very distinct from both European cave
   bears and brown bears, suggesting that these bears could represent an
   independent species; and (iii) the Western European cave bear lineage
   reached at least temporarily to the Altai Mountains, 7000 km east of
   their known centre of distribution. These results suggest that the
   diversity of cave bears was greater than previously believed, and that
   they could survive in a much wider range of ecological conditions than
   previously assumed. They also agree with recent studies on other extinct
   and extant species, such as wolves, hyenas and steppe bison, which have
   also revealed higher genetic and ecological diversity in Pleistocene
   populations than previously known.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of incompatibilities between eggs and sperm is thought to
   play important roles in establishing and maintaining reproductive
   isolation among species of broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates.
   However, the effectiveness of gametic isolation in initiating the
   speciation process and/or in limiting the introgression of genes among
   species at later stages of divergence remains largely unknown. In the
   present study, we collected DNA sequence data from five loci in four
   species of Strongylocentrotus sea urchins (S. droebachiensis, S.
   pallidus, S. purpuratus, and S. franciscanus) to test whether the
   susceptibility of S. droebachiensis eggs to fertilization by
   heterospecific sperm results in gene flow between species. Despite the
   potential for introgression, a small but statistically significant
   signal of introgression was observed only between the youngest pair of
   sister taxa (S. pallidus and S. droebachiensis) that was strongly
   asymmetrical (from the former into the latter). No significant gene flow
   was observed for either S. purpuratus or S. franciscanus despite the
   ability of their sperm to readily fertilize the eggs of S.
   droebachiensis. Our results demonstrate that asymmetrical gamete
   compatibilities in strongylocentrotids can give rise to asymmetrical
   patterns of introgression but suggest that gamete traits alone cannot be
   responsible for maintaining species integrities. The genetic boundaries
   between strongylocentrotid urchin species in the northeast Pacific
   appear to be related to postzygotic isolating mechanisms that scale with
   divergence times and not intrinsic gametic incompatibilities per se.}},

Abstract = {{Using ancient DNA sequences of subfossil European pond turtles (Emys
   orbicularis) from Britain, Central and North Europe and accelerator mass
   spectrometry radiocarbon dating for turtle remains from most Swedish
   sites, we provide evidence for a Holocene range expansion of the pond
   turtle from the southeastern Balkans into Britain, Central Europe and
   Scandinavia, according to the `grasshopper pattern' of Hewitt.
   Northeastern Europe and adjacent Asia were colonized from another refuge
   located further east. With increasing annual mean temperatures, pond
   turtles reached southern Sweden approximately 9800 years ago. Until
   approximately 5500 years ago, rising temperatures facilitated a further
   range expansion up to ostergotland, Sweden (approximately 58 degrees
   30'N). However, around 5500 years ago pond turtle records suddenly
   terminate in Sweden, some 1500 years before the Holocene thermal maximum
   ended in Scandinavia and distinctly earlier than previously thought.
   This extinction coincides with a temporary cooling oscillation during
   the Holocene thermal maximum and is likely related to lower summer
   temperatures deteriorating reproductive success. Although climatic
   conditions improved later again, recolonization of Sweden from southern
   source populations was prevented by the Holocene submergence of the
   previous land connection via the Danish Straits that occurred
   approximately 8500 years ago.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1263-1272}},

Abstract = {{The study of latitudinal increases in organismal body size (Bergmann's
   rule) predates even Darwin's evolutionary theory. While research has
   long concentrated on identifying general evolutionary explanations for
   this phenomenon, recent work suggests that different factors operating
   on local evolutionary timescales may be the cause of this widespread
   trend. Bergmann's rule explains body size variation in a diversity of
   warm-blooded organisms and there is increasing evidence that Bergmann's
   rule is also widespread in ectotherms. Bergmann's rule acts
   differentially in species of the Syngnathidae, a family of teleost
   fishes noted for extreme adaptations for male parental care. While
   variation in body size of polygamous Syngnathus pipefish is consistent
   with Bergmann's rule, body size is uncorrelated with latitude in
   monogamous Hippocampus seahorses. A study of populations of Syngnathus
   leptorhynchus along a natural latitudinal and thermal gradient indicates
   that increases in body size with latitude maintain the potential
   reproductive rate of males despite significant decreases in ambient
   temperatures. Polygyny is necessary in order to maximize male
   reproductive success in S. leptorhynchus, suggesting a possible a link
   between fecundity selection and Bergmann's rule in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of genetic population structures of clonally reproducing
   macro-organisms have revealed large areas where only one clone is found.
   These areas, referred to as clonal patches, have not been shown to occur
   in free-living microbes until now. In free-living microbes, high genetic
   diversity at local scales is usually maintained by high rates of
   dispersal. We report, however, a highly dense, 12-m clonal patch of the
   social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum in a cattle pasture located in a
   Texas Gulf Coast prairie. We confirm the presence of only one clone by
   the analysis of 65 samples and amplification of 10 polymorphic
   microsatellite loci. Samplings of additional cattle pastures nearby
   showed higher clonal diversity, but with a density of D. discoideum
   isolates lower than in the clonal patch. These findings show that high
   rates of microbial dispersal do not always produce genetic diversity at
   local scales, contrary to the findings of previous studies. The
   existence of clonal patches may be particularly important for microbial
   social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Although intensively investigated for biological control of insect
   pests, little is known about the ecology of the fungal entomopathogenic
   genus Beauveria in natural or agricultural habitats. In this study, we
   used molecular phylogenetic and genotypic information to infer species
   diversity, reproductive potential and genetic structure of Beauveria
   occurring within a single arable field and bordering hedgerow in
   Denmark. Isolates were sampled from cultivated field and hedgerow soils,
   from insects harbouring latent fungal infections, and from the
   phylloplanes of three plant species common in the hedgerow flora. A
   nuclear phylogeny of this local Beauveria assemblage resolved seven
   phylogenetic species, including (i) five phylogenetic species within
   Beauveria bassiana sensu stricto; (ii) Clade C, a taxonomically
   uncharacterized species that is morphologically indistinguishable but
   phylogenetically distant from B. bassiana s.s.; and (iii) Beauveria
   brongniartii. All seven species were present throughout the hedgerow
   habitat, including as infections in insects. Significantly, only B.
   bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species Eu\_1 was isolated from tilled soils.
   Mating type polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that all five
   B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species possess bipolar outcrossing mating
   systems. Of these, only the Eu\_1 population contained two mating types;
   however, a 31:2 skew in MAT1:MAT2 mating types suggests a low frequency
   of sexual reproduction in this population. The four remaining B.
   bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species were fixed for single mating types
   and these populations are evidently clonal. Multilocus microsatellite
   genotyping revealed polymorphism in all five phylogenetic species of B.
   bassiana s.s.; however, all show evidence of clonal genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial endosymbionts are common in insects and can have dramatic
   effects on their host's evolution. So far, the only heritable symbionts
   found in Drosophila have been Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. While the
   incidence and effects of Wolbachia have been studied extensively, the
   prevalence and significance of Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila are
   less clear. These small, gram-positive, helical bacteria infect a
   diverse array of plant and arthropod hosts, conferring a variety of
   fitness effects. Male-killing Spiroplasma are known from certain
   Drosophila species; however, in others, Spiroplasma appear not to affect
   sex ratio. Previous studies have identified different Spiroplasma
   haplotypes in Drosophila populations, although no extensive surveys have
   yet been reported. We used a multilocus sequence analysis to reconstruct
   a robust Spiroplasma endosymbiont phylogeny, assess genetic diversity,
   and look for evidence of recombination. Six loci were sequenced from
   over 65 Spiroplasma-infected individuals from nine different Drosophila
   species. Analysis of these sequences reveals at least five separate
   introductions of four phylogenetically distinct Spiroplasma haplotypes,
   indicating that more extensive sampling will likely reveal an even
   greater Spiroplasma endosymbiont diversity. Patterns of variation in
   Drosophila mitochondrial haplotypes in Spiroplasma-infected and
   uninfected flies imply imperfect vertical transmission in host
   populations and possible horizontal transmission.}},

   such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent
   selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit
   stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to
   such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral
   differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological
   speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of
   genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being
   reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) `outlier
   loci' with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality,
   and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive
   phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation
   across population pairs {[}'isolation by adaptation' (IBA)]. The latter
   pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is
   reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased.
   Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and
   literatures. We find that studies generally report 5-10\% of loci to be
   outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome,
   commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population
   pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological
   variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci
   putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we
   conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to
   heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and
   distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied
   substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of
   divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e.
   genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Among freshwater organisms, water flow is frequently considered to be
   one of the most important environmental variables affecting life-history
   traits such as dispersal abilities and therefore genetic structure.
   Recent studies have suggested that habitat type alone as defined by
   water flow is predictive of genetic population differentiation, while
   others have advocated against broad generalizations in favour of more
   conservative, species-specific conclusions. If aquatic habitat type is
   predictive of population differentiation, then one would expect
   sympatric taxa that occupy the same aquatic habitat to converge on a
   similar genetic structure. We tested this prediction by examining the
   haplotype diversity, phylogeographical concordance, population
   connectivity and population isolation of three lotic water beetle
   species in southern California: Anacaena signaticollis, Eubrianax
   edwardsii and Stictotarsus striatellus. In addition to coarse habitat
   and geography, we also controlled for the potentially confounding
   factors of range size, method of dispersal and clade independence.
   Together, the species spanned extremes of genetic and phylogeographical
   structure in all measures examined, suggesting that a coarse dichotomy
   of aquatic habitat type is not predictive of genetic structure. While
   there is little question that water flow plays a major role in shaping
   the life-history traits of freshwater organisms, it is perilous to
   confer predictive properties to an artificially simplistic dichotomy or
   use it as a surrogate for other unmeasured variables.}},

Abstract = {{Population genetics of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd) show that isolates are highly related and globally
   homogenous, data that are consistent with the recent epidemic spread of
   a previously endemic organism. Highly related isolates are predicted to
   be functionally similar due to low levels of heritable genetic
   diversity. To test this hypothesis, we took a global panel of Bd
   isolates and measured (i) the genetic relatedness among isolates, (ii)
   proteomic profiles of isolates, (iii) the susceptibility of isolates to
   the antifungal drug caspofungin, (iv) the variation among isolates in
   growth and phenotypic characteristics, and (v) the virulence of isolates
   against the European common toad Bufo bufo. Our results show (i)
   genotypic differentiation among isolates, (ii) proteomic differentiation
   among isolates, (iii) no significant differences in susceptibility to
   caspofungin, (iv) differentiation in growth and phenotypic/morphological
   characters, and (v) differential virulence in B. bufo. Specifically, our
   data show that Bd isolates can be profiled by their genotypic and
   proteomic characteristics, as well as by the size of their sporangia. Bd
   genotypic and phenotypic distance matrices are significantly correlated,
   showing that less-related isolates are more biologically unique. Mass
   spectrometry has identified a set of candidate genes associated with
   inter-isolate variation. Our data show that, despite its rapid global
   emergence, Bd isolates are not identical and differ in several important
   characters that are linked to virulence. We argue that future studies
   need to clarify the mechanism(s) and rate at which Bd is evolving, and
   the impact that such variation has on the host-pathogen dynamic.}},

Abstract = {{Barriers along a watercourse and interconnections between drainage
   systems are dynamic landscape elements that are expected to play major
   roles in the dispersal and genetic structure of fish species. The
   objective of this study was to assess the role of these elements using
   creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) in the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve
   (QuEbec, Canada) as model. Numerous impassable waterfalls and
   interconnections among drainage systems were inferred with geographic
   information systems and confirmed de visu. The analysis of 32
   populations using seven nuclear microsatellites revealed the presence of
   three genetically distinct groups. Some groups were found upstream of
   impassable barriers and in adjacent portions of distinct drainage
   systems. Admixture among groups was also detected in some populations.
   Constraining phylogenetic procedures as well as Mantel correlation tests
   confirmed that the genetic structure is more likely to result from
   interconnections between the drainage systems than from the permanent
   network. This study indicates that landscape elements such as
   interconnections are of major importance for circumventing impassable
   barriers and colonizing lakes that are otherwise inaccessible. Such an
   approach could be relevant for determining the origins of fish species
   (i.e. native vs. introduced) in the context of conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Styela clava, an ascidian native to the northwest Pacific, was first
   recorded in the Atlantic at Plymouth, southwest England, in 1953. It now
   ranges in the northeast Atlantic from Portugal to northern Denmark, and
   has colonized the east coast of North America. Within the region of
   first introduction, we aimed to characterize current genetic diversity
   in the species, elucidate the respective roles of human-aided vs.
   natural dispersal, and assess the extent of larval dispersal by looking
   for genetic differentiation at very small scales. Eight sites, mostly
   marinas, were studied along c. 200 km of coast in southwest England
   encompassing Plymouth. Five microsatellite loci were genotyped in 303
   individuals to analyse gene flow at regional (among sites) and fine
   (within sites) scales. F-statistics and assignment tests were used to
   investigate regional genetic structure. At the fine scale, deviation
   from mutation-drift equilibrium was tested, and isolation by distance
   and genetic clustering analyses were undertaken. Significant genetic
   differentiation existed between sites, unrelated to geographical
   separation; migration between geographically distant marinas was
   inferred, highlighting the likely importance of human-mediated dispersal
   in range expansion and occupancy by S. clava. Fine-scale population
   structure was present within at least four sites, which may be explained
   by the limited dispersal ability of this ascidian and recruitment from
   differentiated pools of larvae. Populations in enclosed marinas had
   higher self-recruitment rates than those in open sites. Some marinas
   might therefore function as reservoirs of propagules for subsequent
   spread, whereas others might be sinks for migrants.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical isolation and polyploidization are central concepts in
   plant evolution. The hierarchical organization of archipelagos in this
   study provides a framework for testing the evolutionary consequences for
   polyploid taxa and populations occurring in isolation. Using amplified
   fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers, we
   determined the genetic diversity and differentiation patterns at three
   levels of geographical isolation in Olea europaea:
   mainland-archipelagos, islands within an archipelago, and populations
   within an island. At the subspecies scale, the hexaploid ssp. maroccana
   (southwest Morocco) exhibited higher genetic diversity than the insular
   counterparts. In contrast, the tetraploid ssp. cerasiformis (Madeira)
   displayed values similar to those obtained for the diploid ssp.
   guanchica (Canary Islands). Geographical isolation was associated with a
   high genetic differentiation at this scale. In the Canarian archipelago,
   the stepping-stone model of differentiation suggested in a previous
   study was partially supported. Within the western lineage, an
   east-to-west differentiation pattern was confirmed. Conversely, the
   easternmost populations were more related to the mainland ssp. europaea
   than to the western guanchica lineage. Genetic diversity across the
   Canarian archipelago was significantly correlated with the date of the
   last volcanic activity in the area/island where each population occurs.
   At the island scale, this pattern was not confirmed in older islands
   (Tenerife and Madeira), where populations were genetically homogeneous.
   In contrast, founder effects resulted in low genetic diversity and
   marked genetic differentiation among populations of the youngest island,
   La Palma.}},

Abstract = {{We fit a molecular data set, consisting of the rpL16 cpDNA marker and
   eight microsatellite loci, to the isolation-with-migration model as
   implemented in IMa to test a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis of
   relationships within the Carex macrocephala species complex
   (Cyperaceae). The phylogenetic hypothesis suggests C. macrocephala from
   North America is reciprocally monophyletic and is sister to a
   reciprocally monophyletic clade of C. kobomugi. The North American C.
   macrocephala and C. kobomugi clade form a sister clade with a lineage of
   Asian C. macrocephala, thereby forming a paraphyletic C. macrocephala
   species. Not only does the phylogenetic hypothesis suggest C.
   macrocephala is paraphyletic, but it also suggests that the two lineages
   which share a partially overlapping distribution, Asian C. macrocephala
   and C. kobomugi, are not the most closely related. To test these
   relationships, we used coalescent-based population genetic models to
   infer divergence time for each lineage pair within the species complex.
   The coalescent-based models account for the stochastic forces which
   drive population divergence, and can account for the lineage sorting
   that occurs prior to lineage divergence. A drawback to
   phylogenetic-based phylogeographical analyses is that they do not
   account for stochastic lineage sorting that occurs between gene
   divergence and lineage divergence. By comparing the relative divergence
   time of the three main lineages within this group, Asian C.
   macrocephala, North American C. macrocephala, and C. kobomugi, we
   concluded that the phylogenetic hypothesis is incorrect, and the
   divergence between these lineages occurred during the Late Pleistocene
   epoch.}},

   fluctuation: concordance between phylogeography and palaeo-distribution

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing appreciation of impacts of late-Quaternary climate
   fluctuations on spatial patterns of species and genetic diversity. A
   major challenge is to understand how and why species respond
   individualistically to a common history of climate-induced habitat
   fluctuation. Here, we combine modelling of palaeo-distributions and
   mitochondrial-DNA phylogeographies to compare spatial patterns of
   population persistence and isolation across three species of rainforest
   skinks (Saproscincus spp.) with varying climatic preferences. Using
   Akaike Information Criterion model-averaged projections, all three
   species are predicted to have maintained one or more small populations
   in the northern Wet Tropics, multiple or larger populations in the
   central region, and few if any in the south. For the high-elevation
   species, Saproscincus czechurai, the warm-wet climate of the mid
   Holocene was most restrictive, whereas for the generalist S. basiliscus
   and lower-elevation S. tetradactyla, the cool-dry last glacial maximum
   was most restrictive. As expected, S. czechurai was the most genetically
   structured species, although relative to modelled distributions, S.
   basiliscus had surprisingly deep phylogeographical structure among
   southern rainforest isolates, implying long-term isolation and
   persistence. For both S. basiliscus and S. tetradactyla, there was high
   genetic diversity and complex phylogeographical patterns in the central
   Wet Tropics, reflecting persistence of large, structured populations. A
   previously identified vicariant barrier separating northern and central
   regions is supported, and results from these species also emphasize a
   historical persistence of populations south of another biogeographical
   break, the Tully Gorge. Overall, the results support the contention that
   in a topographically heterogeneous landscape, species with broader
   climatic niches may maintain higher and more structured genetic
   diversity due to persistence through varying climates.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) in
   pocilloporid corals originating from various reef habitats surrounding
   Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, was examined by targeting
   ribosomal, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genes using six methods that
   analyse for sequence differences. The ability of each of 13 genetic
   analyses to characterize eight ecologically distinct Symbiodinium spp.
   was dependent on the level of conservation of the gene region targeted
   and the technique used. Other than differences in resolution,
   phylogenetic reconstructions using nuclear and organelle gene sequences
   were complementary and when combined produced a well-resolved phylogeny.
   Analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers using denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting in combination with
   sequencing of dominant bands provided a precise method for rapidly
   resolving and characterizing symbionts into ecologically and
   evolutionarily distinct units of diversity. Single-stranded conformation
   polymorphisms of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (D1/D2 domain)
   identified the same number of ecologically distinct Symbiodinium spp.,
   but profiles were less distinctive. The repetitive sequencing of
   bacterially cloned ITS2 polymerase chain reaction amplifications
   generated numerous sequence variants that clustered together according
   to the symbiont under analysis. The phylogenetic relationships between
   these clusters show how intragenomic variation in the ribosomal array
   diverges among closely related eukaryotic genomes. The strong
   correlation between phylogenetically independent lineages with different
   ecological and physiological attributes establishes a clear basis for
   assigning species designations to members of the genus Symbiodinium.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones in ecotones can be useful model systems for the study of
   evolutionary processes that shape the distribution and discreteness of
   species. Such studies could be important for an improved understanding
   of the complex biogeography of Madagascar, which is renowned for its
   outstanding degree of small-scale endemism. Certain forest remnants in
   central Madagascar indicate that transitional corridors across the
   island could have connected microendemics in different forest types in
   the past. Evolutionary processes in such corridors are difficult to
   study because most of these corridors have disappeared due to
   deforestation in central Madagascar. We studied a hybrid zone in one of
   the few remaining ecotonal corridors between dry and humid forests in
   Madagascar, which connects two species of mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   griseorufus in dry spiny forest and Microcebus murinus in humid littoral
   forest. We sampled 162 mouse lemurs at nine sites across this boundary.
   Morphometric analyses revealed intermediate morphotypes of many
   individuals in transitional habitat. Bayesian clustering of
   microsatellite genotypes and assignment tests yielded evidence for a
   mixed ancestry of mouse lemurs in the ecotone, where we also observed
   significant linkage disequilibria and heterozygote deficiency. In
   contrast to these observations, mitochondrial haplotypes displayed a
   sharply delimited boundary at the eastern edge of spiny forest, which
   was noncoincident with the signals from microsatellite data. Among
   several alternative scenarios, we propose asymmetric nuclear
   introgression due to male-biased dispersal, divergent environmental
   selection, and an expansion of dry spiny forest in the course of
   aridification as a probable explanation of our observations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of past climatic events on species may
   facilitate predictions of how species will respond to future climate
   change. To this end, we sampled populations of the common pond snail
   Radix balthica over the entire species range (northwestern Europe).
   Using a recently developed analytical framework that employs ecological
   niche modelling to obtain hypotheses that are subsequently tested with
   statistical phylogeography, we inferred the range dynamics of R.
   balthica over time. A Maxent modelling for present-day conditions was
   performed to infer the climate envelope for the species, and the
   modelled niche was used to hindcast climatically suitable range at the
   last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 21 000 years ago. Ecological niche
   modelling predicted two suitable areas at the LGM within the present
   species range. Phylogeographic model selection on a COI mitochondrial
   DNA data set confirmed that R. balthica most likely spread from these
   two disjunct refuges after the LGM. The match observed between the
   potential range of the species at the LGM given its present climatic
   requirements and the phylogeographically inferred refugial areas was a
   clear argument in favour of niche conservatism in R. balthica, thus
   allowing to predict the future range. The subsequent projection of the
   potential range under a global change scenario predicts a moderate
   pole-ward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of
   areas currently occupied in France, western Great Britain and southern
   Germany.}},

Abstract = {{In order to properly manage and conserve exploited shark species,
   detailed analyses of their population structure is needed. Global
   populations of Galeorhinus galeus are in decline due to the exploitation
   of the fishery over the past 80 years. Currently, the genetic structure
   of eastern Pacific populations of G. galeus is not known and recent
   observations in the northeastern Pacific suggest an increase in numbers.
   To evaluate gene flow among populations of G. galeus, 116 samples were
   collected and analysed from six geographically dispersed locations:
   Australia, North America, South Africa, South America (Argentina and
   Peru), and the UK. Analysis of 968 to 1006 bp of the 1068-bp
   mitochondrial control region revealed 38 unique haplotypes that were
   largely restricted to their collecting locality. Significant genetic
   structure was detected among populations (Phi(ST) = 0.84; P < 0.000001)
   and migration estimates were low (Nm = 0.05-0.97). Due to an apparent
   lack of migration, populations of G. galeus appear to be isolated from
   each other with little to no gene flow occurring among them. As a
   consequence of this isolation, increasing numbers of G. galeus in the
   northeastern Pacific can be best explained by local recruitment and not
   by input from geographically distant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fungus-growing termites live in obligate mutualistic symbiosis with
   species of the basidiomycete genus Termitomyces, which are cultivated on
   a substrate of dead plant material. When the termite colony dies, or
   when nest material is incubated without termites in the laboratory,
   fruiting bodies of the ascomycete genus Xylaria appear and rapidly cover
   the fungus garden. This raises the question whether certain Xylaria
   species are specialised in occupying termite nests or whether they are
   just occasional visitors. We tested Xylaria specificity at four levels:
   (1) fungus-growing termites, (2) termite genera, (3) termite species,
   and (4) colonies. In South Africa, 108 colonies of eight termite species
   from three termite genera were sampled for Xylaria. Xylaria was isolated
   from 69\% of the sampled nests and from 57\% of the incubated fungus
   comb samples, confirming high prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   ITS region revealed 16 operational taxonomic units of Xylaria,
   indicating high levels of Xylaria species richness. Not much of this
   variation was explained by termite genus, species, or colony; thus, at
   level 2-4 the specificity is low. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA
   region, showed that all termite-associated Xylaria belong to a single
   clade, together with only three of the 26 non-termite-associated
   strains. Termite-associated Xylaria thus show specificity for
   fungus-growing termites (level 1). We did not find evidence for
   geographic or temporal structuring in these Xylaria phylogenies. Based
   on our results, we conclude that termite-associated Xylaria are specific
   for fungus-growing termites, without having specificity for lower
   taxonomic levels.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of the phylogenetic structure of communities can help
   reveal contemporary ecological interactions, as well as link community
   ecology with biogeography and the study of character evolution. The
   number of studies employing this broad approach has increased to the
   point where comparison of their results can now be used to highlight
   successes and deficiencies in the approach, and to detect emerging
   patterns in community organization. We review studies of the
   phylogenetic structure of communities of different major taxa and
   trophic levels, across different spatial and phylogenetic scales, and
   using different metrics and null models. Twenty-three of 39 studies
   (59\%) find evidence for phylogenetic clustering in contemporary
   communities, but terrestrial and/or plant systems are heavily
   over-represented among published studies. Experimental investigations,
   although uncommon at present, hold promise for unravelling mechanisms
   underlying the phylogenetic community structure patterns observed in
   community surveys. We discuss the relationship between metrics of
   phylogenetic clustering and tree balance and explore the various
   emerging biases in taxonomy and pitfalls of scale. Finally, we look
   beyond one-dimensional metrics of phylogenetic structure towards
   multivariate descriptors that better capture the variety of ecological
   behaviours likely to be exhibited in communities of species with
   hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Nonrandom dispersal has been recently advanced as a mechanism promoting
   fine-scale genetic differentiation in resident populations, yet how this
   applies to species with high rates of dispersal is still unclear. Using
   a migratory species considered a classical example of male-biased
   dispersal (the greater snow goose, Chen caerulescens atlantica), we
   documented a temporally stable fine-scale genetic clustering between
   spatially distinct rearing sites (5-30 km apart), where family
   aggregates shortly after hatching. Such genetic differentiation can only
   arise if, in both sexes, dispersal is restricted and nonrandom, a
   surprising result considering that pairing occurs among mixed flocks of
   birds more than 3000 km away from the breeding grounds. Fine-scale
   genetic structure may thus occur even in migratory species with high
   gene flow. We further show that looking for genetic structure based on
   nesting sites only may be misleading. Genetically distinct individuals
   that segregated into different rearing sites were in fact spatially
   mixed during nesting. These findings provide new, scale-dependent links
   between genetic structure, pairing, and dispersal and show the
   importance of sampling different stages of the breeding cycle in order
   to detect a spatial genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Landraces are domesticated local plant varieties that did not experience
   a deliberate and intensive selection during a formal breeding programme.
   In Europe, maize landraces are still cultivated, particularly in
   marginal areas where traditional farming is often practiced. Here, we
   have studied the evolution of flint maize landraces from central Italy
   over 50 years of on-farm cultivation, when dent hybrid varieties were
   introduced and their use was widespread. We have compared an `old'
   collection, obtained during the 1950s, before the introduction of
   hybrids, and a recent collection of maize landraces. For comparison, a
   sample of maize landraces from north Italy, and of improved germplasm,
   including hybrids and inbred lines were also used. A total of 296
   genotypes were analysed using 21 microsatellites. Our results show that
   the maize landraces collected in the last 5-10 years have evolved
   directly from the flint landrace gene pool cultivated in central Italy
   before the introduction of modern hybrids. The population structure,
   diversity and linkage disequilibrium analyses indicate a significant
   amount of introgression from hybrid varieties into the recent landrace
   populations. No evidence of genetic erosion of the maize landraces was
   seen, suggesting that in situ conservation of landraces is an efficient
   strategy for preserving genetic diversity. Finally, the level of
   introgression detected was very variable among recent landraces, with
   most of them showing a low level of introgression; this suggests that
   coexistence between different types of agriculture is possible, with the
   adoption of correct practices that are aimed at avoiding introgression
   from undesired genetic sources.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene climate fluctuations shaped the patterns of genetic
   diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North
   America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity
   have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Late Pleistocene for
   East Asia, a region of great topographical complexity and presumably
   milder historical climate, remains poorly understood. We analysed 3.86
   kb of the mitochondrial genome of 186 Chinese Hwamei birds,
   Leucodioptron canorum canorum, and found that contrary to the
   conventional expectation of population decline during cold periods
   (stadials), the demographic history of this species shows continuous
   population growth since the penultimate glacial period (about 170 000
   years ago). Refugia were identified in the south, coastal regions, and
   northern inland areas, implying that topographic complexity played a
   substantial role in providing suitable habitats for the Chinese Hwamei
   during cold periods. Intermittent gene flow between these refugia during
   the warmer periods (interstadials) might have resulted in a large
   effective population of this bird through the last glacial period.}},

Abstract = {{The Balkan Peninsula is one of three major European refugial areas. It
   has high biodiversity and endemism, but data on the age and origin of
   its fauna, especially endemics, are limited. Mitochondrial sequence data
   (COI and 16S genes) were used to study the population structure and
   phylogeography of the caddisfly Drusus croaticus and the phylogeny and
   divergence of seven other Drusus species, mostly range-restricted
   endemics of the Dinaric region of the Balkan Peninsula. The divergence
   of D. croaticus populations in Croatia and allopatric Drusus species in
   Bosnia dated to the Pleistocene, showing the importance of this time
   period for the origin and diversification of Balkan endemic taxa. The
   divergence of more distantly related species dated to the Late
   Miocene/Early Pliocene. Population genetic and phylogeographic analysis
   of 115 individuals from 11 populations of D. croaticus revealed a high
   level of genetic differentiation and absence of gene flow between
   populations separated by more than 10 km. The existence of
   allopatrically fragmented lineages in D. croaticus and the endemic
   Bosnian species is most likely the result of long-term isolation in
   multiple microrefugia, probably due to the specific habitat requirements
   and life-history traits of Drusinae coupled with the topographic
   complexity and historical changes in geomorphology of the region.
   Overall, these findings shed light on the processes generating the high
   genetic complexity of this refugial region that parallels the `refugia
   within refugia' pattern widely reported from the Iberian refugium.}},

Abstract = {{Current taxon assignments at the species level are frequently discordant
   with DNA-based analyses. Recent studies on tiger beetles in the
   Cicindela hybrida complex identified discordance between mtDNA patterns
   and the entities currently defined by the taxonomic literature. To test
   the accuracy of morphologically delimited groups, five named taxa
   (species) from 24 representative sampling sites across Europe were
   scored for 41 external morphological characters. Three of the named taxa
   were `diagnosable', that is, defined by between one and three characters
   unique to each group. Newly sequenced ITS1 and existing mitochondrial
   cox1 markers established 20 and 22 different haplotypes, respectively,
   but only cox1 produced (four) diagnosable units. Phylogenetic analysis
   and statistical parsimony networks showed poor congruence of character
   variation with the taxonomic entities (and each other). Variation in
   morphological characters was therefore tested directly for association
   with DNA-based nesting groups at various hierarchical levels using
   permutational contingency analysis. Significant statistical associations
   of 11 (of 13 variable) morphological characters were observed with
   nesting groups from ITS1 and mitochondrial DNA markers, predominantly at
   the 4-step level. The analysis demonstrates the need for formal tests of
   congruence with morphological variation at the level of individual
   characters, a step that is omitted from recent studies of `integrative
   taxonomy'. In addition, statistical correlation of particular
   morphological characters with DNA-based nesting groups can identify the
   lowest hierarchical level at which various character sets show
   congruence, as a means to define evolutionarily separated entities
   supported by diverse data sources.}},

Title = {{Survival in the Rockies of an endangered hybrid swarm from diverged

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In North America, caribou (Rangifer tarandus) experienced
   diversification in separate refugia before the last glacial maximum.
   Geographical isolation produced the barren-ground caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus groenlandicus) with its distinctive migratory habits, and the
   woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which has sedentary
   behaviour and is now in danger of extinction. Herein we report on the
   phylogenetics, population structure, and migratory habits of caribou in
   the Canadian Rockies, utilizing molecular and spatial data for 223
   individuals. Mitochondrial DNA analyses show the occurrence of two
   highly diverged lineages; the Beringian-Eurasian and North American
   lineages, while microsatellite data reveal that present-day Rockies'
   caribou populations have resulted from interbreeding between these
   diverged lineages. An ice-free corridor at the end of the last
   glaciation likely allowed, for the first time, for barren-ground caribou
   to migrate from the North and overlap with woodland caribou expanding
   from the South. The lack of correlation between nuclear and
   mitochondrial data may indicate that different environmental forces,
   which might also include human-caused habitat loss and fragmentation,
   are currently reshaping the population structure of this postglacial
   hybrid swarm. Furthermore, spatial ecological data show evidence of
   pronounced migratory behaviour within the study area, and suggest that
   the probability of being migratory may be higher in individual caribou
   carrying a Beringian-Eurasian haplotype which is mainly associated with
   the barren-ground subspecies. Overall, our analyses reveal an intriguing
   example of postglacial mixing of diverged lineages. In a landscape that
   is changing due to climatic and human-mediated factors, an understanding
   of these dynamics, both past and present, is essential for management
   and conservation of these populations.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae) dominate the New Zealand
   temperate coastal fish fauna in diversity (26 endemic species, 14
   genera). Most species appear to have evolved as a local radiation and
   mostly occupy sympatric distributions throughout New Zealand. To
   investigate the forces driving current gene-flow patterns and past
   evolutionary histories, we searched for common patterns of population
   genetic subdivision within eight species sampled throughout their
   distributions {[}mitchochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region, n = 1086].
   We hypothesised that common phylogeographical and population
   differentiation patterns would reveal past or ongoing physical
   processes, with differences reflecting stochastic or species-specific
   processes. Striking differences between species were apparent, with
   strong phylogeographical structure detected in Grahamina capito and the
   estuarine species G. nigripenne. G. capito fell into three distinct
   geographically restricted lineages. G. nigripenne largely separated into
   northern and southern lineages (Phi(ST) 0.834). Strong population
   structuring and isolation by distance was evident in Bellapiscis medius,
   B. lesleyae and Forsterygion lapillum (Phi(ST) 0.686, 0.436 and 0.115,
   respectively). High gene flow was apparent in G. gymnota and Ruanoho
   whero, and F. varium. However, for the latter species, isolation was
   apparent with samples collected from the offshore Three Kings Islands.
   Overall, a strong relationship was found between habitat depth and
   population structure among species, and species inhabiting shallower
   water habitats showed lower genetic diversity with higher levels of
   population subdivision. High-latitude populations generally showed low
   haplotype and nucleotide diversity. These data suggest that processes
   resulting from intraspecific differences in habitat preference, climatic
   histories and/or larval ecologies have subdivided populations of shallow
   water triplefin species.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The dating of recent events in the history of organisms needs divergence
   rates based on molecular fingerprint markers. Here, we used amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) of three distantly related alpine
   plant species co-occurring in the Spanish Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees
   and the southwestern Alps/Massif Central to establish divergence rates.
   Within each of these species (Gentiana alpina, Kernera saxatilis and
   Silene rupestris), we found that the degree of AFLP divergence (D(N72))
   between mountain phylogroups was significantly correlated with their
   time of divergence (as inferred from palaeoclimatic/palynological data),
   indicating constant AFLP divergence rates. As these rates did not differ
   significantly among species, a regression analysis based on the pooled
   data was utilized to generate a general AFLP rate. The application of
   this latter rate to AFLP data from other herbaceous plant species
   (Minuartia biflora: Schonswetter et al. 2006; Nigella degenii: Comes et
   al. 2008) resulted in a plausible timing of the recolonization of the
   Svalbard Islands and the separation of populations from the Alps and
   Scandinavia (Minuartia), and of island population separation in the
   Aegean Archipelago (Nigella). Furthermore, the AFLP mutation rate
   obtained in our study is of the same magnitude as AFLP mutation rates
   published previously. The temporal limits of our AFLP rate, which is
   based on intraspecific vicariance events at shallow (i.e. late
   glacial/Early Holocene) time scales, remains to be tested.}},

Abstract = {{How Quaternary climatic oscillations affected range distributions and
   intraspecific divergence of alpine plants on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
   (QTP) remains largely unknown. Here, we report a survey of chloroplast
   DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA
   variation aimed at exploring the phylogeographical history of the QTP
   alpine endemic Aconitum gymnandrum. We sequenced three cpDNA fragments
   (rpl20-rps12 intergenic spacer, the trnV intron and psbA-trnH spacer)
   and also the nuclear (ITS) region in 245 individuals from 23 populations
   sampled throughout the species' range. Two distinct lineages, with
   eastern and western geographical distributions respectively, were
   identified from a phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequence variation. Based
   on a fast substitution rate, these were estimated to have diverged from
   each other in the early Pleistocene approximately 1.45 Ma. The analysis
   of cpDNA variation identified nine chlorotypes that clustered into two
   major clades that were broadly congruent in geographical distribution
   with the two ITS lineages. The east-west split of cpDNA divergence was
   supported by an amova which partitioned approximately half of the total
   variance between these two groups of populations. Analysis of the
   spatial distribution of chlorotypes showed that each clade was
   subdivided into two groups of populations such that a total of four
   population groups existed in the species. It is suggested that these
   different groups derive from four independent glacial refugia that
   existed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and that three of these
   refugia were located at high altitude on the QTP platform itself at that
   time. Coalescent simulation of chlorotype genealogies supported both an
   early Pleistocene origin of the two main cpDNA clades and also the
   `four-refugia' hypothesis during the LGM. Two previous phylogeographical
   studies of QTP alpine plants indicated that such plants retreated to
   refugia at the eastern/south-eastern plateau edge during the LGM and/or
   previous glacial maxima. However, the results for A. gymnandrum suggest
   that at least some of these cold-tolerant species may have also survived
   centrally on the QTP platform throughout the Quaternary.}},

Abstract = {{We use genetic measures of relatedness and observations of female
   bonding to examine the demographic signature of historically heavy
   poaching of a population of free-ranging African elephants. We collected
   dung samples to obtain DNA and observed behaviour from 102 elephant
   families over a 25-month period in 2003-2005 in Mikumi National Park,
   Tanzania. Poaching reduced the population by 75\% in the decade prior to
   the 1989 ivory trade ban; park records indicate that poaching dropped
   significantly in Mikumi following the ban. Using 10 microsatellite loci,
   DNA was genotyped in 203 elephants and pair-wise relatedness was
   calculated among adult females within and between groups. The Mikumi
   population is characterized by small group size, considerable variation
   in group relatedness, females with no first-order adult relatives and
   females that form only weak social bonds. We used gene-drop analysis and
   a model of a genetically intact pedigree to compare our observed Mikumi
   group relatedness to a simulated genetically intact unpoached
   expectation. The majority of groups in Mikumi contain 2 to 3 adults; of
   these, 45\% were classified as genetically disrupted. Bonding,
   quantified with a pair-wise association index, was significantly
   correlated with relatedness; however only half of the females formed
   strong bonds with other females, and relatedness was substantially lower
   for a given bond strength as compared to an unpoached population. Female
   African elephants without kin demonstrated considerable behavioural
   plasticity in this disturbed environment, grouping with other females
   lacking kin, with established groups, or remaining alone, unable to form
   any stable adult female-bonds. We interpret these findings as the
   remaining effect of poaching disturbance in Mikumi, despite a drop in
   the level of poaching since the commercial trade in ivory was banned 15
   years ago.}},

Abstract = {{The kin structure and dispersal pattern of polar bears (Ursus maritimus)
   of the Barents Sea was investigated during the spring mating season
   using two complementary approaches. First, individual genotypes based on
   the analyses of 27 microsatellite loci of 583 polar bears were related
   to field information gathered from 1146 bears in order to reconstruct
   the animals' pedigrees and to infer geographical distances between adult
   bears of different relatedness categories. According to the data, the
   median natal dispersal distance of the male animals was 52 km while that
   of the females was 93 km. Second, the relatedness of pairs of adult
   bears was estimated and correlated to the geographical distance between
   them. The female dyads had a much stronger kin structure than the male
   dyads. The `pedigree approach' revealed a male kin structure which could
   not be detected using the `relatedness approach'. This suggests that, on
   a broader scale, effective dispersal is slightly male biased. Despite
   fidelity to natal areas, male-mediated gene flow may nevertheless
   prevent genetic differentiation. Males might occasionally shift their
   home range which could therefore lead to a male-biased breeding
   dispersal. Our results showed that a nonterritorial species such as the
   polar bear that has a high dispersal potential, lives in a highly
   unstable environment and migrates seasonally is still able to exhibit a
   distinct kin structure during the mating season.}},

Abstract = {{A possible consequence of planting genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
   in centres of crop origin is unintended gene flow into traditional
   landraces. In 2001, a study reported the presence of the transgenic 35S
   promoter in maize landraces sampled in 2000 from the Sierra Juarez of
   Oaxaca, Mexico. Analysis of a large sample taken from the same region in
   2003 and 2004 could not confirm the existence of transgenes, thereby
   casting doubt on the earlier results. These two studies were based on
   different sampling and analytical procedures and are thus hard to
   compare. Here, we present new molecular data for this region that
   confirm the presence of transgenes in three of 23 localities sampled in
   2001. Transgene sequences were not detected in samples taken in 2002
   from nine localities, while directed samples taken in 2004 from two of
   the positive 2001 localities were again found to contain transgenic
   sequences. These findings suggest the persistence or re-introduction of
   transgenes up until 2004 in this area. We address variability in
   recombinant sequence detection by analyzing the consistency of current
   molecular assays. We also present theoretical results on the limitations
   of estimating the probability of transgene detection in samples taken
   from landraces. The inclusion of a limited number of female gametes and,
   more importantly, aggregated transgene distributions may significantly
   lower detection probabilities. Our analytical and sampling
   considerations help explain discrepancies among different detection
   efforts, including the one presented here, and provide considerations
   for the establishment of monitoring protocols to detect the presence of
   transgenes among structured populations of landraces.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization between genetically divergent populations is common in
   nature. By comparing the rate of gene flow throughout the genome, loci
   that impede genetic mixing, and therefore underlie reproductive
   isolation, can be identified, providing key insights into the process of
   speciation. In a previous issue of Molecular Ecology, Geraldes et al.
   (2008) report the geographical distribution of Y chromosome lineages in
   wild populations of rabbits from across the Iberian Peninsula and
   southern France. Y chromosomes showed a high level of differentiation
   between rabbit subspecies on either side of a hybrid zone, despite clear
   evidence for gene flow at other loci. This provocative result suggests a
   role for the Y chromosome in reproductive isolation, and adds to a
   growing list of nascent species with mosaic patterns of differentiation
   across their genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Neutral models characterize evolutionary or ecological patterns expected
   in the absence of specific causal processes, such as natural selection
   or ecological interactions. In this study, we describe and evaluate
   three neutral models that can, in principle, help to explain the
   apparent `twigginess' of asexual lineages on phylogenetic trees without
   involving the negative consequences predicted for the absence of
   recombination and genetic exchange between individuals. Previously, such
   phylogenetic twiggyness of asexual lineages has been uncritically
   interpreted as evidence that asexuality is associated with elevated
   extinction rates and thus represents an evolutionary dead end. Our first
   model uses simple phylogenetic simulations to illustrate that, with
   sexual reproduction as the ancestral state, low transition rates to
   stable asexuality, or low rates of ascertained `speciation' in asexuals,
   can generate twiggy distributions of asexuality, in the absence of high
   extinction rates for asexual lineages. The second model, developed by
   Janko et al. (2008), shows that a dynamic equilibrium between origins
   and neutral losses of asexuals can, under some conditions, generate a
   relatively low mean age of asexual lineages. The third model posits that
   the risk of extinction for asexual lineages may be higher than that of
   sexuals simply because asexuals inhabit higher latitudes or altitudes,
   and not due to effects of their reproductive systems. Such neutral
   models are useful in that they allow quantitative evaluation of whether
   empirical data, such as phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns of sex
   and asexuality, indeed support the idea that asexually reproducing
   lineages persist over shorter evolutionary periods than sexual lineages,
   due to such processes as mutation accumulation, slower rates of adaptive
   evolution, or relatively lower levels of genetic variability.}},

Abstract = {{The correlation of landscape features with genetic discontinuities
   reveals barriers to dispersal that can contribute to understanding
   present and future spread of wildlife diseases. This knowledge can then
   be used for targeting control efforts. The impact of natural barriers on
   raccoon dispersal was assessed through genetic analysis of samples from
   two regions, Niagara (N = 666) and St. Lawrence (N = 802). These areas
   are transected by major rivers and are at the northern front of a
   raccoon rabies epizootic. Genetic clusters were identified in each
   region using Bayesian clustering algorithms. In the Niagara region, two
   clusters were identified corresponding to either side of the Niagara
   River. For the St. Lawrence region, spatially congruent clusters were
   not identified, despite the presence of the intervening St. Lawrence
   River. These genetic data are consistent with raccoon rabies incidence
   data where rabies has been detected across the St. Lawrence River in
   Ontario while no cases have been detected in Ontario across the Niagara
   River. This is despite expectations of rabies incidence in Niagara
   before the St. Lawrence based on the progression of rabies from New
   York. The results from the two regions suggest different permeabilities
   to raccoons between New York and Ontario that may be attributed to the
   rivers. However, other factors have also been explored that could
   contribute to this difference between these study sites including the
   shape of the landscape and resource distribution.}},

Title = {{Long-term survival despite low genetic diversity in the critically

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The critically endangered Madagascar fish-eagle (Haliaeetus
   vociferoides) is considered to be one of the rarest birds of prey
   globally and at significant risk of extinction. In the most recent
   census, only 222 adult individuals were recorded with an estimated total
   breeding population of no more than 100-120 pairs. Here, levels of
   Madagascar fish-eagle population genetic diversity based on 47
   microsatellite loci were compared with its sister species, the African
   fish-eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), and 16 of these loci were also
   characterized in the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the
   bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Overall, extremely low genetic
   diversity was observed in the Madagascar fish-eagle compared to other
   surveyed Haliaeetus species. Determining whether this low diversity is
   the result of a recent bottleneck or a more historic event has important
   implications for their conservation. Using a Bayesian coalescent-based
   method, we show that Madagascar fish-eagles have maintained a small
   effective population size for hundreds to thousands of years and that
   its low level of neutral genetic diversity is not the result of a recent
   bottleneck. Therefore, efforts made to prevent Madagascar fish-eagle
   extinction should place high priority on maintenance of habitat
   requirements and reducing direct and indirect human persecution. Given
   the current rate of deforestation in Madagascar, we further recommend
   that the population be expanded to occupy a larger geographical
   distribution. This will help the population persist when exposed to
   stochastic factors (e.g. climate and disease) that may threaten a
   species consisting of only 200 adult individuals while inhabiting a
   rapidly changing landscape.}},

Title = {{Invasion genetics of the Eurasian round goby in North America: tracing
   sources and spread patterns}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-79}},

Abstract = {{The Eurasian round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Apollonia melanostoma)
   invaded the North American Great Lakes in 1990 through ballast water,
   spread rapidly, and now is widely distributed and moving through
   adjacent tributaries. We analyse its genetic diversity and divergence
   patterns among 25 North American (N = 744) and 22 Eurasian (N = 414)
   locations using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene sequences and seven
   nuclear microsatellite loci in order to: (i) identify the invasion's
   founding source(s), (ii) test for founder effects, (iii) evaluate
   whether the invasive range is genetically heterogeneous, and (iv)
   determine whether fringe and central areas differ in genetic diversity.
   Tests include F(ST) analogues, neighbour-joining trees, haplotype
   networks, Bayesian assignment, Monmonier barrier analysis, and
   three-dimensional factorial correspondence analysis. We recovered 13
   cytochrome b haplotypes and 232 microsatellite alleles in North America
   and compared these to variation we previously described across Eurasia.
   Results show: (i) the southern Dnieper River population was the primary
   Eurasian donor source for the round goby's invasion of North America,
   likely supplemented by some alleles from the Dniester and Southern Bug
   rivers, (ii) the overall invasion has high genetic diversity and
   experienced no founder effect, (iii) there is significant genetic
   structuring across North America, and (iv) some expansion areas show
   reduced numbers of alleles, whereas others appear to reflect secondary
   colonization. Sampling sites in Lake Huron's Saginaw Bay and Lake
   Ontario significantly differ from all others, having unique alleles that
   apparently originated from separate introductions. Substantial genetic
   variation, multiple founding sources, large number of propagules, and
   population structure thus likely aided the goby's ecological success.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of spatio-temporal genetic variation at a class II major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus and multiple microsatellite loci
   were analysed within and between three water vole metapopulations in
   Scotland, UK. Comparisons of MHC and microsatellite spatial genetic
   differentiation, based on standardised tests between two demographically
   asynchronous zones within a metapopulation, suggested that spatial MHC
   variation was affected by balancing selection, directional selection and
   random genetic drift, but that the relative effects of these
   microevolutionary forces vary temporally. At the metapopulation level,
   between-year differentiation for MHC loci was significantly correlated
   with that of microsatellites, signifying that neutral factors such as
   migration and drift were primarily responsible for overall temporal
   genetic change at the metapopulation scale. Between metapopulations,
   patterns of genetic differentiation implied that, at large spatial
   scales, MHC variation was primarily affected by directional selection
   and drift. Levels of MHC heterozygosity in excess of Hardy-Weinberg
   expectations were consistent with overdominant balancing selection
   operating on MHC variation within metapopulations. However, this effect
   was not constant among all samples, indicating temporal variation in the
   strength of selection relative to other factors. The results highlight
   the benefit of contrasting variation at MHC with neutral markers to
   separate the effects of stochastic and deterministic microevolutionary
   forces, and add to a growing body of evidence showing that the mode and
   relative strength of selection acting on MHC diversity varies both
   spatially and temporally.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Many East African mountains are characterized by an exceptionally high
   biodiversity. Here we assess the hypothesis that climatic fluctuations
   during the Plio-Pleistocene led to ecological fragmentation with
   subsequent genetic isolation and speciation in forest habitats in East
   Africa. Hypotheses on speciation in savannah lineages are also
   investigated. To do this, mitochondrial DNA sequences from a group of
   bush crickets consisting of both forest and savannah inhabiting taxa
   were analysed in relation to Plio-Pleistocene range fragmentations
   indicated by palaeoclimatic studies. Coalescent modelling and mismatch
   distributions were used to distinguish between alternative
   biogeographical scenarios. The results indicate two radiations: the
   earliest one overlaps in time with the global spread of C4 grasslands
   and only grassland inhabiting lineages originated in this radiation.
   Climatically induced retraction of forest to higher altitudes about 0.8
   million years ago, promoting vicariant speciation in species inhabiting
   the montane zone, can explain the second radiation. Although much of the
   biodiversity in East Africa is presently threatened by climate change,
   past climatic fluctuations appear to have contributed to the species
   richness observed in the East African hot spots. Perceiving forests as
   centres of speciation reinforces the importance of conserving the
   remaining forest patches in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The groundwater-dependent springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in
   arid inland Australia represent a unique and threatened ecosystem. These
   incredibly isolated springs support a diverse array of endemic flora and
   fauna. One of the common faunal groups in the GAB springs is the
   freshwater amphipods of the family Chiltoniidae. The morphological
   conservatism and taxonomic uncertainty associated with these amphipods
   has ensured their true biodiversity, phylogeographical history and
   evolutionary affinities have remained unknown. We have used
   mitochondrial DNA and allozyme data to unravel a complicated history of
   isolation, extinction and dispersal among spring amphipod populations
   across the GAB. The results provide evidence for multiple independent
   colonizations in the GAB springs, particularly within the Lake Eyre
   group of springs. The inclusion of a group of Western Australian (WA)
   stygobitic amphipods from populations up to 1500 km away found
   surprising evidence for a shared evolutionary history between stygobitic
   and GAB spring amphipods. Approximate dating of the diversity found
   between major clades suggests the majority of lineages originated in the
   late Miocene, around the time of the aridification of inland Australia.
   The large number of independent lineages and the close connection
   between GAB spring and WA stygobitic amphipods suggest that a
   significantly rich amphipod fauna existed in the much wetter environment
   that once existed in inland Australia. The results also provide evidence
   for a gross underestimation of the species diversity within the springs,
   with 12 putative species identified, a conclusion with significant
   implications for the ongoing conservation of the GAB springs.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the emergence of anthracnose disease has newly
   challenged the health of turfgrasses on North American golf courses,
   resulting in considerable economic loss. The fungus responsible for the
   outbreaks, Colletotrichum cereale, has also been identified from
   numerous natural grasses and cereal crops, although disease symptoms are
   generally absent. Here we utilize phylogenetic and population genetic
   analyses to determine the role of ecosystem in the advancement of
   turfgrass anthracnose and assess whether natural grass and/or cereal
   inhabitants are implicated in the epidemics. Using a four-gene
   nucleotide data set to diagnose the limits of phylogenetic species and
   population boundaries, we find that the graminicolous Colletotrichum
   diverged from a common ancestor into distinct lineages correspondent
   with host physiology (C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathways). In the C4
   lineage, which includes the important cereal pathogens Colletotrichum
   graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. falcatum, C. eleusines, C. caudatum and
   several novel species, host specialization predominates, with
   host-associated lineages corresponding to isolated sibling species.
   Although the C3 lineage - C. cereale - is comprised of one wide
   host-range species, it is divided into 10 highly specialized populations
   corresponding to ecosystem and/or host plant, along with a single
   generalist population spread across multiple habitat types. Extreme
   differentiation between the specialized C. cereale populations suggests
   that asymptomatic nonturfgrass hosts are unlikely reservoirs of
   infectious disease propagules, but gene flow between the generalist
   population and the specialized genotypes provides an indirect mechanism
   for genetic exchange between otherwise isolated populations and
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging diseases are increasing in incidence; therefore, understanding
   how pathogens are introduced into new regions and cause epidemics is of
   importance for the development of strategies that may hinder their
   spread. We used molecular data to study how a vector-borne banana virus,
   Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), spread in Hawaii after it was first
   detected in 1989. Our analyses suggest that BBTV was introduced once
   into Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. All other islands were infected with
   isolates originating from Oahu, suggesting that movement of contaminated
   plant material was the main driving factor responsible for interisland
   spread of BBTV. The rate of mutation inferred by the phylogenetic
   analysis (1.4 x 10(-4) bp/year) was similar to that obtained in an
   experimental evolution study under greenhouse conditions (3.9 x 10(-4)
   bp/year). We used these values to estimate the number of infections
   occurring under field conditions per year. Our results suggest that
   strict and enforced regulations limiting the movement of banana plant
   material among Hawaiian islands could have reduced interisland spread of
   this pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural and trapping studies of the social organization of coypus
   have suggested the occurrence of kin groups and a polygynous mating
   system. We used 16 microsatellite markers to analyse parentage and
   relatedness relationships in two populations (Jauregui and Villa Ruiz)
   in the Argentinean Pampas. At Jauregui, a dominant male monopolized most
   paternities, leading to a high variance in reproductive success between
   males and a high level of polygyny. At Villa Ruiz, variance in
   reproductive success was low among resident males and males were the
   fathers of zero to four offspring each. For females, no significant
   differences were found. Two different social groups in each study site
   were used to assess genetic relatedness within and between groups. These
   groups were neighbouring at Jauregui but not at Villa Ruiz. At Villa
   Ruiz, coypus were significantly more related within than between groups,
   suggesting that behavioural groups were also genetic ones, and adult
   females were more related within than between groups, as should be
   expected for kin groups. This relationship was not found at Jauregui.
   Our results provide support to previous studies based on behavioural and
   trapping data, which indicate that coypus form social groups and have a
   polygynous mating system. However, we found differences in social
   organization between the two populations. This is the first study to
   determine parentage and/or relatedness in coypus.}},

Abstract = {{Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) are dominant ants in open forests
   from India, Australia, China and Southeast Asia, whose leaf nests are
   held together with larval silk. The species, together with its sole
   congener O. longinoda, has been important in research on biological
   control, communication, territoriality and colony integration. Over most
   of the range, only one queen has been found per colony, but the
   occurrence of several queens per nest has been reported for the
   Australian Northern Territory. The number of males mating with each
   queen is little known. Here we report on the colony structure of O.
   smaragdina using published and new microsatellite markers. Worker
   genotype arrays reflect the occurrence of habitual polygyny (more than
   one queen per colony) in 18 colonies from Darwin, Northern Australia,
   with up to five queens inferred per colony. Monogyny (one queen per
   colony) with occasional polygyny was inferred for 14 colonies from
   Queensland, Australia, and 20 colonies from Java, Indonesia. Direct
   genotyping of the sperm carried by 77 Queensland queens and worker
   genotypic arrays of established colonies yielded similar results,
   indicating that less than half of the queens mate only once and some
   mate up to five times. Worker genotype arrays indicated that queens from
   Java and the Northern Territory also often mate with more than one male,
   but less often than those from Queensland. A strong
   isolation-by-distance effect was found for Queensland samples. The
   variation uncovered means that O. smaragdina is a more versatile study
   system than previously supposed.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{169-185}},

Abstract = {{The question of how genetic variation translates into organismal
   diversity has puzzled biologists for decades. Despite recent advances in
   evolutionary and developmental genetics, the mechanisms that underlie
   adaptation, diversification and evolutionary innovation remain largely
   unknown. The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes are
   textbook examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation and
   emerge as powerful model systems to study the genetic basis of animal
   diversification. East Africa's hundreds of endemic cichlid species are
   akin to a natural mutagenesis screen and differ greatly not only in
   ecologically relevant (hence naturally selected) characters such as
   mouth morphology and body shape, but also in sexually selected traits
   such as coloration. One of the most fascinating aspects of cichlid
   evolution is the frequent occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms, which
   has led to the question whether selection alone is sufficient to produce
   these parallel morphologies, or whether a developmental or genetic bias
   has influenced the direction of diversification. Here, I review
   fitness-relevant traits that could be responsible for the cichlids'
   evolutionary success and assess whether these were shaped by sexual or
   natural selection. I then focus on the interaction and the relative
   importance of sexual vs. natural selection in cichlid evolution.
   Finally, I discuss what is currently known about the genes underlying
   the morphogenesis of adaptively relevant traits and highlight the
   importance of the forthcoming cichlid genomes in the quest of the
   genetic basis of diversification in this group.}},

   workers are not aggressive towards conspecifics from different nests,
   even at large geographical scales (up to 3000 km) and between
   populations encompassing a wide range of environmental conditions. By
   contrast, interactions with workers of other species invariably result
   in agonistic behaviours. Genetic analyses reveal that populations have
   low genetic diversity. No genetic differentiation occurs among nests of
   the same population; differentiation between populations, though
   significant, remains weak. Chemical analyses indicate that cuticular
   lipids are similar between colonies of a population, and that
   differentiation between populations is low. Altogether, these results
   indicate that the big-headed ant P. megacephala forms a large
   unicolonial population across northern/eastern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Overexploitation of marine species invariably results in population
   decline but can also have indirect effects on ecological processes such
   as larval dispersal and recruitment that ultimately affect genetic
   diversity and population resilience. We compared microsatellite DNA
   variation among depleted and healthy populations of the black-lip
   abalone Haliotis rubra from Tasmania, Australia, to determine if
   over-fishing had affected genetic diversity. We also used genetic data
   to assess whether variation in the scale and frequency of larval
   dispersal was linked to greater population decline in some regions than
   in others, and if larval dispersal was sufficient to facilitate natural
   recovery of depleted populations. Surprisingly, allelic diversity was
   higher in depleted populations than in healthy populations (P < 0.05).
   Significant subdivision across hundreds of metres among our sampling
   sites (F-ST = 0.026, P < 0.01), coupled with assignment tests, indicated
   that larval dispersal is restricted in all regions studied, and that
   abalone populations across Tasmania are largely self-recruiting. Low
   levels of larval exchange appear to occur at the meso-scale (7-20 km),
   but age estimates based on shell size indicated that successful
   migration of larvae between any two sites may happen only once every few
   years. We suggest that genetic diversity may be higher in depleted
   populations due to the higher relative ratio of migrant to
   self-recruiting larvae. In addition, we expect that recovery of depleted
   abalone populations will be reliant on sources of larvae at the
   meso-scale (tens of km), but that natural recovery is only likely to
   occur on a timescale unacceptable to fishers and resource managers.}},

Abstract = {{The red alga, Asparagopsis taxiformis, has recently expanded its
   distribution range into the Western Mediterranean Sea, and populations
   have now even been found on the Portuguese South coast. All Western
   Mediterranean populations belong to a single mitochondrial cryptic
   lineage (referred to as lineage 2 in earlier studies) and probably
   result from a recent invasion of Indo-Pacific origin. Here we
   investigate fine-scale population genetic diversity and structure within
   and among Mediterranean populations of lineage 2 using eight
   microsatellite loci and compare the obtained patterns with those
   observed in a Californian population of the same lineage. To generate an
   appropriate analytical method suitable to the polyploid status of this
   species, we score microsatellite loci as in a dominant marker system.
   Thereafter, we produce robust descriptors inferred from frequencies of
   both microsatellite alleles and multilocus genotypes. Populations from
   California and the Mediterranean Sea differ considerably in their levels
   of genetic diversity. In the Mediterranean, populations reproduce
   predominantly sexually and exhibit high levels of genotypic variation,
   suggestive either of multiple introductions or of a single introduction
   by a genetically diverse and large group of individuals. Bayesian
   clustering revealed one or possibly two weakly supported panmictic
   subpopulations, indicative of extensive admixture. The expansion of this
   lineage is rapid, possibly due to the absence of eco-physiological
   barriers to gene flow throughout its invasive trajectory.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Bothriocroton hydrosauri is a three-host ixodid tick that infests large
   reptiles in southeastern Australia, where its most common host is a
   large scincid lizard Tiliqua rugosa. Based on previous ecological and
   behavioural studies of this system, we propose a `ripple' model of tick
   population dynamics, where only a few female ticks succeed in producing
   surviving offspring. These females then are the centres of ripples of
   their progeny spreading into the broader landscape. The model predicts
   higher relatedness among larvae than among nymphs or adults on a host,
   and significant spatial autocorrelation in larvae extending further than
   for the later life stages. The model also predicts that adult ticks are
   likely to encounter related partners and that this will generate
   inbreeding within the population. We tested those predictions using nine
   polymorphic microsatellite loci on a sample of 848 ticks (464 larvae,
   140 nymphs and 244 adults) collected from 98 lizard hosts from near
   Bundey Bore Station in South Australia. Our data support the predictions
   and indicate that the dynamics of transmission among hosts play an
   important role in parasite population structure.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{235-247}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of landscape-level processes on the population
   biology of amphibians is critical, especially for species inhabiting
   anthropogenically modified landscapes. Many pond-breeding amphibians are
   presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the
   extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow
   measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of
   population structure than direct measures of migration. This is
   especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians.
   We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic
   population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum)
   breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by
   roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety
   of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a
   model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed
   patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical
   distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a
   relationship between population structure and several indices of
   landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to
   dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among
   ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a
   network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River;
   however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to
   disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors.}},

Abstract = {{The Indo-West Pacific (IWP), from South Africa in the western Indian
   Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, contains some of the most
   biologically diverse marine habitats on earth, including the greatest
   biodiversity of chondrichthyan fishes. The region encompasses various
   densities of human habitation leading to contrasts in the levels of
   exploitation experienced by chondrichthyans, which are targeted for
   local consumption and export. The demersal chondrichthyan, the zebra
   shark, Stegostoma fasciatum, is endemic to the IWP and has two current
   regional International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red
   List classifications that reflect differing levels of exploitation:
   `Least Concern' and `Vulnerable'. In this study, we employed
   mitochondrial ND4 sequence data and 13 microsatellite loci to
   investigate the population genetic structure of 180 zebra sharks from 13
   locations throughout the IWP to test the concordance of IUCN zones with
   demographic units that have conservation value. Mitochondrial and
   microsatellite data sets from samples collected throughout northern
   Australia and Southeast Asia concord with the regional IUCN
   classifications. However, we found evidence of genetic subdivision
   within these regions, including subdivision between locations connected
   by habitat suitable for migration. Furthermore, parametric F(ST)
   analyses and Bayesian clustering analyses indicated that the primary
   genetic break within the IWP is not represented by the IUCN
   classifications but rather is congruent with the Indonesian throughflow
   current. Our findings indicate that recruitment to areas of high
   exploitation from nearby healthy populations in zebra sharks is likely
   to be minimal, and that severe localized depletions are predicted to
   occur in zebra shark populations throughout the IWP region.}},

Abstract = {{The lizard genus Kentropyx (Squamata: Teiidae) comprises nine species,
   which have been placed in three species groups (calcarata group,
   associated to forests ecosystems; paulensis and striata groups,
   associated to open ecosystems). We reconstructed phylogenetic
   relationships of Kentropyx based on morphology (pholidosis and
   coloration) and mitochondrial DNA data (12S and 16S), using maximum
   parsimony and Bayesian methods, and evaluated biogeographic scenarios
   based on ancestral areas analyses and molecular dating by Bayesian
   methods. Additionally, we tested the life-history hypothesis that
   species of Kentropyx inhabiting open ecosystems (under seasonal
   environments) produce larger clutches with smaller eggs and that species
   inhabiting forest ecosystems (under aseasonal conditions) produce
   clutches with fewer and larger eggs, using Stearns'
   phylogenetic-subtraction method and canonical phylogenetic ordination to
   take in to account the effects of phylogeny. Our results showed that
   Kentropyx comprises three monophyletic groups, with K. striata occupying
   a basal position in opposition to previous suggestions of relationships.
   Additionally, Bayesian analysis of divergence time showed that Kentropyx
   may have originated at the Tertiary (Eocene/Oligocene) and the
   `Pleistocene Refuge Hypothesis' may not explain the species
   diversification. Based on ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating,
   we argued that a savanna ancestor is more likely and that historical
   events during the Tertiary of South America promoted the differentiation
   of the genus, coupled with recent Quaternary events that were important
   as dispersion routes and for the diversification at populational levels.
   Clutch size and egg volume were not significantly different between
   major clades and ecosystems of occurrence, even accounting for the
   phylogenetic effects. Finally, we argue that phylogenetic constraints
   and phylogenetic inertia might be playing essential roles in life
   history evolution of Kentropyx.}},

Abstract = {{A phylogeographical analysis of the scald pathogen Rhynchosporium
   secalis was conducted using nuclear DNA sequences from two neutral
   restriction fragment length polymorphism loci and the mating-type
   idiomorphs. Approximately 500 isolates sampled from more than 60 field
   populations from five continents were analysed to infer migration
   patterns and the demographic history of the fungus. Migration rates
   among continents were generally low, consistent with earlier reports of
   significant population subdivision among continents. Northern Europe was
   mainly a source population for global migration. We hypothesize that the
   pathogen only recently moved out of its centre of origin, resulting in
   founder populations that are reproductively isolated due to the
   contemporary absence of long-distance gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The all black carrion crow (Corvus corone corone) and the grey and black
   hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) meet in a narrow hybrid zone across
   Europe. To evaluate the degree of genetic differentiation over the
   hybrid zone, we genotyped crows from the centre and edges of the zone,
   and from allopatric populations in northern (Scotland-Denmark-Sweden)
   and southern Europe (western-central northern Italy), at 18
   microsatellites and at a plumage candidate gene, the MC1R gene.
   Allopatric and edge populations were significantly differentiated on
   microsatellites, and populations were isolated by distance over the
   hybrid zone in Italy. Single-locus analyses showed that one locus,
   CmeH9, differentiated populations on different sides of the zone at the
   same time as showing only weak separation of populations on the same
   side of the zone. Within the hybrid zone there was no differentiation of
   phenotypes at CmeH9 or at the set of microsatellites, no excess of
   heterozygotes among hybrids and low levels of linkage disequilibrium
   between markers. We did not detect any association between phenotypes
   and nucleotide variation at MC1R, and the two most common haplotypes
   occurred in very similar frequencies in carrion and hooded crows. That
   we found a similar degree of genetic differentiation between allopatric
   and edge populations irrespectively of their location in relation to the
   hybrid zone, no differentiation between phenotypes within the hybrid
   zone, and neither heterozygote excess nor consistent linkage
   disequilibrium in the hybrid zone, is striking considering that carrion
   and hooded crows are phenotypically distinct and sometimes recognised as
   separate species.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Phylogeographical studies are typically based on haplotype data,
   occasionally on nuclear markers such as microsatellites, but rarely
   combine both. This is unfortunate because the use of markers with
   contrasting modes of inheritance and rates of evolution might provide a
   more accurate and comprehensive understanding of a species' history.
   Here we present a detailed study of the phylogeography of the greater
   horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using 1098 bp of the
   mitochondrial ND2 gene from 45 localities from across its Palaearctic
   range to infer population history. In addition, we re-analysed a large
   microsatellite data set available for this species and compared the
   results of both markers to infer population relationships and the
   historical processes influencing them. We show that mtDNA, the most
   popular marker in phylogeography studies, yielded a misleading result,
   and would have led us to conclude erroneously that a single expansion
   had taken place in Europe. Only by combining the mitochondrial and
   microsatellite data sets are we able to reconstruct the species' history
   and show two colonization events in Europe, one before the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM) and one after it. Combining markers also revealed the
   importance of Asia Minor as an ancient refugium for this species and a
   source population for the expansion of the greater horseshoe bat into
   Europe before the LGM.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nested clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA) and approximate Bayesian
   computation (ABC) have been used to test phylogeographical hypotheses.
   Multilocus NCPA tests null hypotheses, whereas ABC discriminates among a
   finite set of alternatives. The interpretive criteria of NCPA are
   explicit and allow complex models to be built from simple components.
   The interpretive criteria of ABC are ad hoc and require the
   specification of a complete phylogeographical model. The conclusions
   from ABC are often influenced by implicit assumptions arising from the
   many parameters needed to specify a complex model. These complex models
   confound many assumptions so that biological interpretations are
   difficult. Sampling error is accounted for in NCPA, but ABC ignores
   important sources of sampling error that creates pseudo-statistical
   power. NCPA generates the full sampling distribution of its statistics,
   but ABC only yields local probabilities, which in turn make it
   impossible to distinguish between a good fitting model, a
   non-informative model, and an over-determined model. Both NCPA and ABC
   use approximations, but convergences of the approximations used in NCPA
   are well defined whereas those in ABC are not. NCPA can analyse a large
   number of locations, but ABC cannot. Finally, the dimensionality of
   tested hypothesis is known in NCPA, but not for ABC. As a consequence,
   the `probabilities' generated by ABC are not true probabilities and are
   statistically non-interpretable. Accordingly, ABC should not be used for
   hypothesis testing, but simulation approaches are valuable when used in
   conjunction with NCPA or other methods that do not rely on highly
   parameterized models.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic flagellates play a major role in the digestion of
   lignocellulose in the hindgut of lower termites. Many termite gut
   flagellates harbour a distinct lineage of bacterial endosymbionts,
   so-called Endomicrobia, which belong to the candidate phylum Termite
   Group 1. Using an rRNA-based approach, we investigated the phylogeny of
   Trichonympha, the predominant flagellates in a wide range of termite
   species, and of their Endomicrobia symbionts. We found that Trichonympha
   species constitute three well-supported clusters in the Parabasalia
   tree. Endomicrobia were detected only in the apical lineage (Cluster I),
   which comprises flagellates present in the termite families Termopsidae
   and Rhinotermitidae, but apparently absent in the basal lineages
   (Clusters II and III) consisting of flagellates from other termite
   families and from the wood-feeding cockroach, Cryptocercus punctulatus.
   The endosymbionts of Cluster I form a monophyletic group distinct from
   many other lineages of Endomicrobia and seem to have cospeciated with
   their flagellate host. The distribution pattern of the symbiotic pairs
   among different termite species indicates that cospeciation of
   flagellates and endosymbionts is not simply the result of a spatial
   separation of the flagellate lineages in different termite species, but
   that Endomicrobia are inherited among Trichonympha species by vertical
   transmission. We suggest extending the previously proposed candidatus
   name `Endomicrobium trichonymphae' to all Endomicrobia symbionts of
   Trichonympha species, and estimate that the acquisition by an ancestor
   of Trichonympha Cluster I must have occurred about 40-70 million years
   ago, long after the flagellates entered the termites.}},

Abstract = {{Adelges cooleyi is a host-alternating, gall-making insect native to the
   Rocky Mountains and Cascade Mountains in western North America. The
   insect's primary hosts are Picea (spruce) species, and its secondary
   host is Pseudotsuga menziesii, Douglas fir. To determine whether there
   are large-scale patterns of genetic variation in this specialist insect,
   we created molecular phylogenies of geographically separate samples of
   A. cooleyi using sequence data from two mitochondrial (mtDNA) genes and
   amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Three divergent mtDNA
   lineages were identified. Analysis of mtDNA and AFLP genetic variation
   revealed that samples from southeastern Arizona are genetically isolated
   from all other samples. AFLP data identified possible gene flow between
   individuals from divergent mtDNA lineages in an area in the central
   Rocky Mountains. Factors that likely affected divergence within A.
   cooleyi were identified by comparing our conclusions with well-known
   changes in the distribution of vegetation in response to glaciations and
   previous phylogeographical work conducted on this specialist insect's
   host-plants. In addition to documenting previously unknown patterns of
   genetic variation in A. cooleyi, our work provides the basis for a
   testable hypothesis regarding the extent to which the distribution of
   variation in Picea and Pseudotsuga hosts mediates the distribution of
   genetic variation for this specialist insect.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen-mediated gene flow was measured in two populations of black
   cottonwood using direct (paternity analysis) and indirect (correlated
   paternity) methods. The Marchel site was an area with an approximate
   radius of 250 m in a large continuous stand growing in a mesic habitat
   in western Oregon. In contrast, the Vinson site was an area with a
   radius of approximately 10 km and consisted of small, disjunct and
   isolated stands in the high desert of eastern Oregon. Pollen immigration
   was extensive in both populations, and was higher in the Marchel site
   (0.54 +/- 0.02) than in the substantially larger and more isolated
   Vinson site (0.32 +/- 0.02). Pollen pool differentiation among mothers
   was approximately five times stronger in the Vinson population (Phi(FT)
   = 0.253, N = 27 mothers) than in the Marchel population (Phi(FT) =
   0.052, N = 5 mothers). Pollen dispersal was modelled using a mixed
   dispersal curve that incorporated pollen immigration. Predicted
   pollination frequencies generated based on this curve were substantially
   more accurate than those based on the widely used exponential power
   dispersal curve. Male neighbourhood sizes (Wright 1946) estimated using
   paternity analysis and pollen pool differentiation were remarkably
   similar. They were three to five times smaller in the Vinson population,
   which reflected the substantial ecological and demographic differences
   between the two populations. When the same mathematical function was
   used, applying direct and indirect methods resulted in similar pollen
   dispersal curves, thus confirming the value of indirect methods as a
   viable lower-cost alternative to paternity analysis.}},
