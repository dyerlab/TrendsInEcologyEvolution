Abstract = {{The negative effects of human-induced habitat disturbance and
   modification on multiple dimensions of biological diversity are well
   chronicled (Turner 1996; Harding et al. 1998; Lawton et al. 1998; Sakai
   et al. 2001). Among the more insidious consequences is secondary contact
   between formerly allopatric taxa (Anderson \& Hubricht 1938; Perry et
   al. 2002; Seehausen 2006). How the secondary contact will play out is
   unpredictable (Ellstrand et al. 2010), but if the taxa are not fully
   reproductively isolated, hybridization is likely, and if the resulting
   progeny are fertile, the eventual outcome is often devastating from a
   conservation perspective (Rhymer \& Simberloff 1996; Wolf et al. 2001;
   McDonald et al. 2008). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Steeves et
   al. (2010) present an analysis of hybridization between two avian
   species, one of which is critically endangered and the other of which is
   invasive. Their discovery that the endangered species has not yet been
   hybridized to extinction is promising and not what one would necessarily
   expect from theory.}},

Abstract = {{New technologies promise to revolutionize the field of molecular
   ecology. This technological progress comes with its own set of
   challenges. Among the most important ones is the analysis and
   interpretation of the data in a way that tells us about the molecular
   causes of the phenotype of interest and its consequences. In this issue,
   Whitehead et al. (2010) reveal part of the mechanistic basis of evolved
   pollution tolerance by studying the developmental and transcriptional
   response of tolerant and sensitive fish embryos to polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), a pollutant commonly found in coastal waters of the
   United States. By integrating their gene expression profiling data with
   phenotypic data on individuals along with what is known about pathways
   by which this pollutant acts in zebrafish and mammals, they are able to
   suggest detailed mechanisms that have evolved to allow a fish population
   to adapt to a very damaging pollutant and develop normally.}},

Abstract = {{All-female `species' of fish have been shown to be great models in
   ecological and evolutionary studies because of the insights they can
   provide into the origin and evolution of asexuality, the ecology of
   hybrids, associations between genotype and environment, and the
   maintenance of sex. Gynogenetic organisms that evolved from sexual
   ancestors, and combine the disadvantageous traits from sexuality and
   asexuality, have long baffled evolutionary biologists trying to
   understand their origin and persistence with their sympatric sexual
   counterparts. In this issue, a new study using an integrated molecular
   phylogenetic and classical genetic approach has uncovered compelling
   evidence regarding the obscure asexual origin of the Amazon molly,
   Poecilia formosa. By performing an extensive phylogeographic analysis,
   Stock et al. (2010) provide evidence that the Amazon molly arose only
   once within its history, with monophyly being strongly supported by
   mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analyses. This result, combined
   with an elaborate failed attempt to resynthesize the lineage, suggests
   that vertebrate gynogens such as the Amazon molly are not rare because
   they are at a disadvantage to their sexual counterparts, but because the
   genomic conditions under which they arise are rare. Organisms that
   apparently combine the disadvantages of both sexuality and asexuality
   remain difficult to understand from both an ecological and an
   evolutionary perspective, and Stock et al. (2010) highlight several
   outstanding important questions. Nonetheless, given that we now have a
   better knowledge of the origin and history of this unique `species',
   this should allow researchers to better understand how these frozen F1's
   can persist amidst the masterpiece of nature.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization facilitated by human activities has dramatically altered
   the evolutionary trajectories of threatened taxa around the globe.
   Whereas introduced mammalian predators and widespread habitat loss and
   degradation clearly imperil the recovery and survival of the New Zealand
   endemic black stilt or kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae), the risk
   associated with hybridization between this critically endangered endemic
   and its self-introduced congener, the pied stilt or poaka (Himantopus
   himantopus leucocephalus) is less clear. Here, we combine Bayesian
   admixture analyses of microsatellite data with mitochondrial DNA
   sequence data to assess the levels of hybridization and introgression
   between kaki and poaka. We show that birds classified as hybrids on the
   basis of adult plumage are indeed of hybrid origin and that
   hybridization between kaki and poaka is both extensive and
   bidirectional. Despite this, we found almost no evidence for
   introgression from poaka to kaki, thus negating the popular belief that
   kaki represent a hybrid swarm. To our knowledge, ours represents the
   first comprehensive study to document a lack of widespread introgression
   for a species at risk despite a recent history of extensive
   bidirectional human-induced hybridization. We attribute this rather
   surprising result, in part, to reduced reproductive success in female
   hybrids combined with a transient male-biased kaki sex ratio. To
   maximize the evolutionary potential of kaki, we use these data to
   recommend conservation management activities aimed to maintain the
   genetic integrity and to maximize the genetic diversity of this iconic
   rare bird.}},

Abstract = {{Colour polymorphisms (CP's) continue to be of interest to evolutionary
   biologists because of their general tractability, importance in studies
   of selection and potential role in speciation. Since some of the
   earliest studies of CP, it has been evident that alternative colour
   morphs often differ in features other than colour. Here we review the
   rapidly accumulating evidence concerning the genetic mechanisms
   underlying correlations between CP and other traits in animals. We find
   that evidence for genetic correlations is now available for
   taxonomically diverse systems and that physical linkage and regulatory
   mechanisms including transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements, and
   hormone systems provide pathways for the ready accumulation or
   modification of these correlations. Moreover, physical linkage and
   regulatory mechanisms may both contribute to genetic correlation in some
   of the best-studied systems. These results raise the possibility that
   negative frequency-dependent selection and disruptive selection might
   often be acting on suites of traits and that the cumulative effects of
   such selection, as well as correlational selection, may be important to
   CP persistence and evolution. We consider additional evolutionary
   implications. We recommend continued efforts to elucidate the mechanisms
   underlying CP-correlated characters and the more frequent application of
   comparative approaches, looking at related species that vary in
   character correlations and patterns of selection. We also recommend
   efforts to elucidate how frequency-dependent selection may act on suites
   of characters.}},

Abstract = {{Acacias across Africa have enormous ecological and economic importance,
   yet their population genetics are poorly studied. We used seven
   microsatellite loci to investigate spatial genetic structure and to
   identify potential ecological and geographic barriers to dispersal in
   the widespread acacia, Senegalia (Acacia) mellifera. We quantified
   variation among 791 individuals from 28 sampling locations, examining
   patterns at two spatial scales: (i) across Kenya including the Rift
   Valley, and (ii) for a local subset of 11 neighbouring locations on
   Mpala Ranch in the Laikipia plateau. Our analyses recognize that
   siblings can often be included in samples used to measure population
   genetic structure, violating fundamental assumptions made by these
   analyses. To address this potential problem, we maximized genetic
   independence of samples by creating a sibship-controlled data set that
   included only one member of each sibship and compared the results
   obtained with the full data set. Patterns of genetic structure and
   barriers to gene flow were essentially similar when the two data sets
   were analysed. Five well-defined geographic regions were identified
   across Kenya within which gene flow was localized, with the two
   strongest barriers to dispersal splitting the Laikipia Plateau of
   central Kenya from the Western and Eastern Rift Valley. At a smaller
   scale, in the absence of geographic features, regional habitat gradients
   appear to restrict gene flow significantly. We discuss the implications
   of our results for the management of this highly exploited species.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of pleiotropy and epistasis in quantitative traits remains
   equivocal. In the case of pleiotropy, multiple quantitative trait loci
   are often taken to be pleiotropic if their confidence intervals overlap,
   without formal statistical tests being used to ascertain if these
   overlapping loci are statistically significantly pleiotropic.
   Additionally, the degree to which the genetic correlations between
   phenotypic traits are reflected in these pleiotropic quantitative trait
   loci is often variable, especially in the case of antagonistic
   pleiotropy. Similarly, the extent of epistasis in various morphological,
   behavioural and life-history traits is also debated, with a general
   problem being the sample sizes required to detect such effects.
   Domestication involves a large number of trade-offs, which are reflected
   in numerous behavioural, morphological and life-history traits which
   have evolved as a consequence of adaptation to selective pressures
   exerted by humans and captivity. The comparison between wild and
   domestic animals allows the genetic analysis of the traits that differ
   between these population types, as well as being a general model of
   evolution. Using a large F(2) intercross between wild and domesticated
   chickens, in combination with a dense SNP and microsatellite marker map,
   both pleiotropy and epistasis were analysed. The majority of traits were
   found to segregate in 11 tight `blocks' and reflected the trade-offs
   associated with domestication. These blocks were shown to have a
   pleiotropic `core' surrounded by more loosely linked loci. In contrast,
   epistatic interactions were almost entirely absent, with only six pairs
   identified over all traits analysed. These results give insights both
   into the extent of such blocks in evolution and the development of
   domestication itself.}},

Title = {{Habitat distribution influences dispersal and fine-scale genetic
   population structure of eastern foxsnakes (Mintonius gloydi) across a

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a fundamental attribute of species in nature and shapes
   population dynamics, evolutionary trajectories and genetic variation
   across spatial and temporal scales. It is increasingly clear that
   landscape features have large impacts on dispersal patterns. Thus,
   understanding how individuals and species move through landscapes is
   essential for predicting impacts of landscape alterations. Information
   on dispersal patterns, however, is lacking for many taxa, particularly
   reptiles. Eastern foxsnakes (Mintoinus gloydi) are marsh and prairie
   specialists that avoid agricultural fields, but they have persisted
   across a fragmented region in southwestern Ontario and northern Ohio.
   Here, we combined habitat suitability modelling with population genetic
   analyses to infer how foxsnakes disperse through a habitat mosaic of
   natural and altered landscape features. Boundary regions between the
   eight genetic clusters, identified through assignment tests, were
   comprised of low suitability habitat (e. g. agricultural fields). Island
   populations were grouped into a single genetic cluster, and
   comparatively low F-ST values between island and mainland populations
   suggest open water presents less of a barrier than nonsuitable
   terrestrial habitat. Isolation by resistance and least-cost path
   analysis produced similar results with matrices of pairwise individual
   genetic distance significantly more correlated to matrices of resistance
   values derived from habitat suitability than models with an
   undifferentiated landscape. Spatial autocorrelation results matched
   better with assignment results when incorporating resistance values
   rather than straight-line distances. All analyses used in our study
   produced similar results suggesting that habitat degradation limits
   dispersal for foxsnakes, which has had a strong effect on the genetic
   population structure across this region.}},

Abstract = {{Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) are frequently used to
   examine the relationship between genetic diversity and fitness. Most
   studies have reported positive HFCs, although there is a strong bias
   towards investigating HFCs in genetically impoverished populations. We
   investigated HFCs in a large genetically diverse breeding population of
   Kentish plovers Charadrius alexandrinus in southern Turkey. This small
   shorebird exhibits highly variable mating and care systems, and it is
   becoming an ecological model species to understand breeding system
   evolution. Using 11 conserved and six anonymous microsatellite markers,
   we tested whether and how heterozygosity was associated with chick
   survival, tarsus and body mass growth controlling for nongenetic effects
   (chick sex, hatching date, length of biparental care and site quality)
   that influence survival and growth. There was no genome-wide effect of
   heterozygosity on fitness, and we did not find any significant effects
   of heterozygosity on growth rates. However, two of the 11 conserved
   markers displayed an association with offspring survival: one marker
   showed a positive HFC, whereas the other marker showed a negative HFC.
   Heterozygosity at three further conserved loci showed significant
   interaction with nongenetic variables. In contrast, heterozygosity based
   on anonymous microsatellite loci was not associated with fitness or
   growth. Markers that were correlated with chick survival were not more
   likely to be located in exons or introns than other markers that lacked
   this association.}},

Abstract = {{Wild populations of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus resident in
   heavily contaminated North American Atlantic coast estuaries have
   recently and independently evolved dramatic, heritable, and adaptive
   pollution tolerance. We compared physiological and transcriptome
   responses to embryonic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures between
   one tolerant population and a nearby sensitive population to gain
   insight into genomic, physiological and biochemical mechanisms of
   evolved tolerance in killifish, which are currently unknown. The PCB
   exposure concentrations at which developmental toxicity emerged, the
   range of developmental abnormalities exhibited, and global as well as
   specific gene expression patterns were profoundly different between
   populations. In the sensitive population, PCB exposures produced
   dramatic, dose-dependent toxic effects, concurrent with the alterations
   in the expression of many genes. For example, PCB-mediated
   cardiovascular system failure was associated with the altered expression
   of cardiomyocyte genes, consistent with sarcomere mis-assembly. In
   contrast, genome-wide expression was comparatively refractory to PCB
   induction in the tolerant population. Tolerance was associated with the
   global blockade of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling
   pathway, the key mediator of PCB toxicity, in contrast to the strong
   dose-dependent up-regulation of AHR pathway elements observed in the
   sensitive population. Altered regulation of signalling pathways that
   cross-talk with AHR was implicated as one candidate mechanism for the
   adaptive AHR signalling repression and the pollution tolerance that it
   affords. In addition to revealing mechanisms of PCB toxicity and
   tolerance, this study demonstrates the value of comparative
   transcriptomics to explore molecular mechanisms of stress response and
   evolved adaptive differences among wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the advantage of avoiding the costs of sexual reproduction,
   asexual vertebrates are very rare and often considered evolutionarily
   disadvantaged when compared to sexual species. Asexual species, however,
   may have advantages when colonizing (new) habitats or competing with
   sexual counterparts. They are also evolutionary older than expected,
   leaving the question whether asexual vertebrates are not only rare
   because of their `inferior' mode of reproduction but also because of
   other reasons. A paradigmatic model system is the unisexual Amazon
   molly, Poecilia formosa, that arose by hybridization of the Atlantic
   molly, Poecilia mexicana, as the maternal ancestor, and the sailfin
   molly, Poecilia latipinna, as the paternal ancestor. Our extensive
   crossing experiments failed to resynthesize asexually reproducing
   (gynogenetic) hybrids confirming results of previous studies. However,
   by producing diploid eggs, female F-1-hybrids showed apparent
   preadaptation to gynogenesis. In a range-wide analysis of mitochondrial
   sequences, we examined the origin of P. formosa. Our analyses point to
   very few or even a single origin(s) of its lineage, which is estimated
   to be approximately 120 000 years old. A monophyletic origin was
   supported from nuclear microsatellite data. Furthermore, a considerable
   degree of genetic variation, apparent by high levels of clonal
   microsatellite diversity, was found. Our molecular phylogenetic evidence
   and the failure to resynthesize the gynogenetic P. formosa together with
   the old age of the species indicate that some unisexual vertebrates
   might be rare not because they suffer the long-term consequences of
   clonal reproduction but because they are only very rarely formed as a
   result of complex genetic preconditions necessary to produce viable and
   fertile clonal genomes and phenotypes ('rare formation hypothesis').}},

Abstract = {{Population studies have revealed that the fungal ectomycorrhizal
   morphospecies Tricholoma scalpturatum consists of at least two
   genetically distinct groups that occur sympatrically in several
   geographical areas. This discovery prompted us to examine species
   boundaries and relationships between members formerly assigned to T.
   scalpturatum and allied taxa using phylogenetic analyses. Sequence data
   were obtained from three nuclear DNA regions {[}internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS), gpd and tef], from 101 carpophores collected over a large
   geographical range in Western Europe, and some reference sequences from
   public databases. The ITS was also tested for its applicability as DNA
   barcode for species delimitation. Four highly supported phylogenetic
   clades were detected. The two previously detected genetic groups of T.
   scalpturatum were assigned to the phylospecies Tricholoma argyraceum and
   T. scalpturatum. The two remaining clades were referred to as Tricholoma
   cingulatum and Tricholoma inocybeoides. Unexpectedly, T. cingulatum
   showed an accelerated rate of evolution that we attributed to narrow
   host specialization. This study also reveals recombinant ITS sequences
   in T. inocybeoides, suggesting a hybrid origin. The ITS was a useful
   tool for the determination of species boundaries: the mean value of
   intraspecific genetic distances in the entire ITS region (including 5.8S
   rDNA) was <0.2\%, whereas interspecific divergence estimates ranged from
   1.78\% to 4.22\%. Apart from giving insights into the evolution of the
   T. scalpturatum complex, this study contributes to the establishment of
   a library of taxonomically verified voucher specimens, an a posteriori
   correlation between phenotype and genotype, and DNA barcoding of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Animals with internal fertilization often exhibit marked diversification
   in genital morphology among closely related species. However, our
   knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying genital evolution is
   still limited. We constructed genetic linkage maps and analysed
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) for F(2) hybrids of two closely related
   species of the carabid beetles Carabus (Ohomopterus) iwawakianus and C.
   (O.) maiyasanus, which show matching male and female genital shapes
   within species, but marked differences in genital morphologies between
   species. The linkage maps comprised both amplified fragment length
   polymorphism and microsatellite markers. Composite interval mapping to
   detect QTL for three traits of male copulatory piece (length, width,
   weight) and two traits for female vaginal appendix (length, width)
   resulted in the detection of one to five significant QTL for each trait.
   The QTL explained large proportions of phenotypic variance. Thus, the
   interspecific difference in the genital morphologies appeared to be
   determined by relatively small numbers of genes with large genetic
   effects. QTL of different traits for the same or different sexes
   co-occurred on five of eight linkage groups with significant QTL; in
   particular, three QTL for different male and female genital traits
   occurred almost at the same position. Each of the male genital traits
   showed uniform signs of additive genetic effects, suggesting that
   directional selection has led to species-specific morphologies. However,
   the signs of additive genetic effects in each female genital trait were
   not uniform, suggesting that coevolution between sexes is not
   necessarily concerted. This result requires further assessment because
   the sample size of F(2) females was small.}},

Abstract = {{In the Southern and Southeastern Brazilian highlands, a clade of seven
   species of Petunia that are endemic to the region (P. altiplana, P.
   bonjardinensis, P. guarapuavensis, P. mantiqueirensis, P. reitzii, P.
   saxicola and P. scheideana) exists in association with grassland
   formations. These formations are isolated in high-altitude regions,
   being surrounded by forested areas, and experienced
   contraction-expansion cycles associated with the glacial cycles of the
   Pleistocene. To understand the evolutionary history of this group, the
   divergence of which is probably linked to these past shifts in habitat,
   we analysed the sequences of the plastidial intergenic spacers trnH-psbA
   and trnS-trnG from populations throughout the known distributions of all
   seven species. The common ancestor of this highland clade started to
   differentiate similar to 0.9 million years (Myr) ago, which corresponds
   to a high diversification rate of 2.06 species per Myr in the
   intervening period. The high level of haplotype sharing among several
   species in the clade and the absence of reciprocal monophyly suggest the
   persistence of ancestral polymorphisms during speciation events and/or
   past hybridization, because no hybrid was found. Four of the five
   species displayed very low genetic diversity and possessed either one or
   two haplotypes, which is consistent with long-term isolation in
   restricted areas. The three more diverse species displayed significant
   population structure, and P. altiplana showed a clear signs of
   population growth during the last glacial period. These results suggest
   that diversification occurred as a result of expansion of the ancestral
   species of the clade during glacial periods followed by fragmentation
   and isolation during retraction in interglacial periods.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the distributions and routes of colonization of two
   commensal subspecies of house mouse in Norway: Mus musculus domesticus
   and M. m. musculus. Five nuclear markers (Abpa, D11 cenB2, Btk, SMCY and
   Zfy2) and a morphological feature (tail length) were used to
   differentiate the two subspecies and assess their distributions, and
   mitochondrial (mt) D-loop sequences helped to elucidate their
   colonization history. M. m. domesticus is the more widespread of the two
   subspecies, occupying the western and southern coast of Norway, while M.
   m. musculus is found along Norway's southeastern coast and east from
   there to Sweden. Two sections of the hybrid zone between the two
   subspecies were localized in Norway. However, hybrid forms also occur
   well away from that hybrid zone, the most prevalent of which are mice
   with a M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome and an otherwise M. m.
   domesticus genome. MtDNA D-loop sequences of the mice revealed a complex
   phylogeography within M. m. domesticus, reflecting passive human
   transport to Norway, probably during the Viking period. M. m. musculus
   may have colonized earlier. If so, that leaves open the possibility that
   M. m. domesticus replaced M. m. musculus from much of Norway, with the
   widely distributed hybrids a relict of this process. Overall, the
   effects of hybridization are evident in house mice throughout Norway.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing species' range-wide cytoplasmic diversity provides valuable
   insights regarding their dispersal and adaptive potential in a changing
   environment. Transcontinental chloroplast (cpDNA) and mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) population structures were compared to identify putative
   ancestral and new cytoplasmic genome assemblages in black spruce (Picea
   mariana), a North American boreal conifer. Mean within-population
   diversity and allelic richness for cpSSR markers were 0.80 and 4.21,
   respectively, and diminished westward. Population differentiation based
   on G(ST) was lower for cpDNA than for mtDNA (G(ST) = 0.104 and 0.645,
   respectively) but appeared comparable when estimated using Jost
   differentiation index (D = 0.459 and 0.537, respectively). Further
   analyses resulted in the delineation of at least three genetically
   distinct cpDNA lineages partially congruent with those inferred from
   mtDNA data, which roughly corresponded to western, central and eastern
   Canada. Additionally, the patterns of variation in Alaska for both cpDNA
   and mtDNA markers suggested that black spruce survived the last glacial
   maximum in this northern region. The range-wide comparison of the
   geographic extent of cytoplasmic DNA lineages revealed that extensive
   pollen gene flow between ancestral lineages occurred preferentially from
   west to east during the postglacial expansion of the species, while
   seed-mediated gene flow remained geographically restricted. This
   differential gene flow promoted intraspecific cytoplasmic capture that
   generated new assemblages of cpDNA and mtDNA genomes during the
   Holocene. Hence, black spruce postglacial colonization unexpectedly
   resulted in an increase in genetic diversity with possible adaptive
   consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-bias in natal dispersal patterns can have important genetic and
   evolutionary consequences; however, reliable information about
   sex-biased dispersal can be difficult to obtain with observational
   methods. We analysed the sex-specific patterns of genetic
   differentiation among three Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)
   populations, using 11 autosomal and six Z-chromosomal microsatellite
   markers. Irrespective of marker-type and indices used (viz. F(ST),
   average pairwise relatedness and effective number of immigrants), all
   analyses provided strong evidence for male-biased dispersal. Population
   structuring at autosomal loci (F(ST) = 0.046, P < 0.05) exceeded that at
   Z-chromosomal loci (F(ST) = 0.033, P < 0.05), and levels of
   introgression were inferred to be significantly higher for Z-chromosomal
   when compared to autosomal loci. Of the three populations studied,
   levels of genetic variability were the lowest in the southernmost fringe
   population, despite the fact that it harboured a group of divergent
   Z-chromosomal haplotypes that were not found in the other two
   populations. In general, the results provide strong genetic evidence for
   male-biased dispersal in Siberian jays, where observational data have
   previously suggested male philopatry. The results also highlight the
   utility of Z-chromosomal markers for gaining insights into the genetic
   diversity and structuring of populations.}},

Abstract = {{Mating with attractive or dominant males is often predicted to offer
   indirect genetic benefits to females, but it is still largely unclear
   how important such non-random mating can be with regard to embryo
   viability. We sampled a natural population of adult migratory brown
   trout (Salmo trutta), bred them in vitro in a half-sib breeding design
   to separate genetic from maternal environmental effects, raised 2098
   embryos singly until hatching, and exposed them experimentally to
   different levels of pathogen stress at a late embryonic stage. We found
   that the embryos' tolerance to the induced pathogen stress was linked to
   the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of their parents, i.e.
   certain MHC genotypes appeared to provide better protection against
   infection than others. We also found significant additive genetic
   variance for stress tolerance. Melanin-based dark skin patterns revealed
   males with `good genes', i.e. embryos fathered by dark coloured males
   had a high tolerance to infection. Mating with large and dominant males
   would, however, not improve embryo viability when compared to random
   mating. We used simulations to provide estimates of how mate choice
   based on MHC or melanin-based skin patterns would influence embryos'
   tolerance to the experimentally induced pathogen stress.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple introductions can play a prominent role in explaining the
   success of biological invasions. One often cited mechanism is that
   multiple introductions of invasive species prevent genetic bottlenecks
   by parallel introductions of several distinct genotypes that, in turn,
   provide heritable variation necessary for local adaptation. Here, we
   show that the invasion of Aegilops triuncialis into California, USA,
   involved multiple introductions that may have facilitated invasion into
   serpentine habitats. Using microsatellite markers, we compared the
   polymorphism and genetic structure of populations of Ae. triuncialis
   invading serpentine soils in California to that of accessions from its
   native range. In a glasshouse study, we also compared phenotypic
   variation in phenological and fitness traits between invasive and native
   populations grown on loam soil and under serpentine edaphic conditions.
   Molecular analysis of invasive populations revealed that Californian
   populations cluster into three independent introductions (i.e. invasive
   lineages). Our glasshouse common garden experiment found that all
   Californian populations exhibited higher fitness under serpentine
   conditions. However, the three invasive lineages appear to represent
   independent pathways of adaptation to serpentine soil. Our results
   suggest that the rapid invasion of serpentine habitats in California may
   have been facilitated by the existence of colonizing Eurasian genotypes
   pre-adapted to serpentine soils.}},

Abstract = {{Separating historical effects from recent anthropogenic pressures on
   population structure is paramount for understanding how species have
   persisted over time and how conservation efforts should best proceed. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Chiucchi \& Gibbs (2010) have separated
   the impacts of ancient and modern habitat fragmentation on genetic
   structure and migration rates in an endangered species of rattlesnake,
   the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus). Previous studies have
   ignored ancient processes, estimated genetic isolation and migration
   using collections from different timescales, used markers with different
   rates of evolution or compared contemporary populations in both
   continuous and fragmented habitats (Keyghobadi 2007). Here, Chiucchi \&
   Gibbs (2010) estimate migration parameters from microsatellites at two
   timescales using coalescent methods. Results strongly suggest that
   massasaugas are characterized by the low levels of migration with strong
   regional and range-wide differences, typical of many organisms residing
   in the patches of habitat surrounded by seas of agriculture, but that
   these patterns have existed since the Pleistocene. The novel methodology
   and hypotheses addressed in Chiucchi \& Gibbs (2010) highlight future
   avenues for examining the impacts of fragmentation through time.}},

Abstract = {{The present-day spatial distribution of interspecific contact zones and
   intraspecific phylogeographical breaks provides a window into the past
   ecological and evolutionary processes that underlie speciation and
   species ranges. The clustering of contact zones and/or phylogeographical
   breaks in space indicates the suturing of diverged biotas. The presence
   of such suture zones indicates that similar ecological and historical
   factors have influenced the past and present distributions of
   populations and their divergence. Thus, suture zones are ideal natural
   laboratories for studying divergence, secondary contact and speciation
   across many different taxa. The concept of suture zones was formalized
   decades ago by Remington (1968), but only a few detailed and
   quantitative investigations of suture zones exist (Swenson \& Howard
   2004, 2005; Whinnett et al. 2005; Moritz et al. 2009). This limited
   number of investigations is largely because of a lack of detailed
   geographical data and sophisticated analytical tools. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Rissler \& Smith (2010) have accomplished a detailed
   investigation into the suturing of amphibian lineages in the United
   States which uses both detailed geographical data and sophisticated
   analytical methods. The work greatly enhances our knowledge of suture
   zones by extending previous work that has focused less on amphibians and
   by explicitly considering the relationship between species richness and
   suture zones.}},

   mitochondrial DNA. By design, each locus was `deep sequenced' to enable
   SNP identification. To demonstrate the reliability of their data, the
   work included samples from six captive chimps, which allowed for a
   comparison between presumably genuine SNPs obtained from blood and
   potentially flawed SNPs deduced from faeces. Thus, with this method,

Abstract = {{Genomic-level analyses of DNA from non-invasive sources would facilitate
   powerful conservation and evolutionary studies in natural populations of
   endangered and otherwise elusive species. However, the typical low
   quantity and poor quality of DNA that is extracted from non-invasive
   samples have generally precluded such work. Here we apply a modified DNA
   capture protocol that, when used in combination with massively-parallel
   sequencing technology, facilitates efficient and highly-accurate
   resequencing of megabases of specified nuclear genomic regions from
   fecal DNA samples. We validated our approach by comparing genetic
   variants identified from corresponding fecal and blood DNA samples of
   six western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) across more than 1.5
   megabases of chromosome 21, chromosome X, and the complete mitochondrial
   genome. Our results suggest that it is now feasible to conduct genomic
   studies in natural populations for which constraints on invasive
   sampling have otherwise long been a barrier. The data we collected also
   provided an opportunity to examine western chimpanzee genetic diversity
   at unprecedented scale. Despite high mitochondrial genome diversity (pi
   = 0.585\%), western chimpanzees have a low ratio (0.42) of X chromosomal
   (pi = 0.034\%) to autosomal (chromosome 21 pi = 0.081\%) sequence
   diversity, a pattern that may reflect an unusual demographic history of
   this subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of endangered taxa in recently fragmented habitats often
   show high levels of genetic structure, but the role that contemporary
   versus historical processes play in generating this pattern is unclear.
   The eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus c. catenatus) is an
   endangered snake that presently occurs throughout central and eastern
   North America in a series of populations that are isolated because of
   habitat fragmentation and destruction. Here, we use data from 19
   species-specific microsatellite DNA loci to assess the levels of genetic
   differentiation, genetic effective population size, and contemporary and
   historical levels of gene flow for 19 populations sampled across the
   range of this snake. Eastern massasaugas display high levels of genetic
   differentiation (overall 0(Fst) = 0.21) and a Bayesian clustering method
   indicates that each population represents a unique genetic cluster even
   at regional spatial scales. There is a twofold variation in genetically
   effective population sizes but little genetic evidence that populations
   have undergone recent or historical declines in size. Finally, both
   contemporary and historical migration rates among populations were low
   and similar in magnitude even for populations located <7 km apart. A
   test of alternate models of population history strongly favours a model
   of long-term drift-migration equilibrium over a recent isolation
   drift-only model. These results suggest that recent habitat
   fragmentation has had little effect on the genetic characteristics of
   these snakes, but rather that this species has historically existed in
   small isolated populations that may be resistant to the long-term
   negative effects of inbreeding.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of population structure and genetic diversity and the
   spatio-temporal demographic processes affecting populations is crucial
   for effective wildlife preservation, yet these factors are still poorly
   understood for organisms with large continuous ranges. Available
   population genetic data reveal that widespread mammals have for the most
   part only been carefully studied at the local population scale, which is
   insufficient for understanding population processes at larger scales.
   Here, we provide data on population structure, genetic diversity and
   gene flow in a brown bear population inhabiting the large territory of
   northwestern Eurasia. Analysis of 17 microsatellite loci indicated
   significant population substructure, consisting of four genetic groups.
   While three genetic clusters were confined to small geographical
   areas-located in Estonia, southern Finland and Leningrad oblast,
   Russia-the fourth cluster spanned a very large area broadly falling
   between northern Finland and the Arkhangelsk and Kirov oblasts of
   Russia. Thus, the data indicate a complex pattern where a fraction of
   the population exhibits large-scale gene flow that is unparalleled by
   other wild mammals studied to date, while the remainder of the
   population appears to have been structured by a combination of
   demographic history and landscape barriers. These results based on
   nuclear data are generally in good agreement with evidence previously
   derived using mitochondrial markers, and taken together, these markers
   provide complementary information about female-specific and
   population-level processes. Moreover, this study conveys information
   about spatial processes occurring over multiple generations that cannot
   be readily gained using other approaches, e. g. telemetry.}},

Abstract = {{The bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, is a widespread exotic
   species in Japan that is considered to have originated from 15 fish
   introduced from Guttenberg, Iowa, in 1960. Here, the genetic and
   phenotypic traits of Japanese populations were examined, together with
   11 native populations of the USA using 10 microsatellite markers and six
   meristic traits. Phylogenetic analysis reconfirmed a single origin of
   Japanese populations, among which populations established in the 1960s
   were genetically close to Guttenberg population, keeping high genetic
   diversity comparable to the ancestral population. In contrast, genetic
   diversity of later-established populations significantly declined with
   genetic divergence from the ancestral population. Among the 1960s
   established populations, that from Lake Biwa showed a significant
   isolation-by-distance pattern with surrounding populations in which
   genetic bottlenecks increased with geographical distance from Lake Biwa.
   Although phenotypic divergence among populations was recognized in both
   neutral and adaptive traits, P(ST)-F(ST) comparisons showed that it is
   independent of neutral genetic divergence. Divergent selection was
   suggested in some populations from reservoirs with unstable habitats,
   while stabilizing selection was dominant. Accordingly, many Japanese
   populations of L. macrochirus appear to have derived from Lake Biwa
   population, expanding their distribution with population bottlenecks.
   Despite low propagule pressure, the invasion success of L. macrochirus
   is probably because of its drastic population growth in Lake Biwa
   shortly after its introduction, together with artificial
   transplantations. It not only enabled the avoidance of a loss in genetic
   diversity but also formed a major gene pool that supported local
   adaptation with high phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression divergence is one of the mechanisms thought to be
   involved in the emergence of incipient species. Next-generation
   sequencing has become an extremely valuable tool for the study of this
   process by allowing whole transcriptome sequencing, or RNA-Seq. We have
   conducted a 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing experiment to refine our
   understanding of adaptive divergence between dwarf and normal lake
   whitefish species (Coregonus clupeaformis spp.). The objectives were to:
   (i) investigate transcriptomic divergence as measured by liver RNA-Seq;
   (ii) test the correlation between divergence in expression and sequence
   polymorphism; and (iii) investigate the extent of allelic imbalance. We
   also compared the results of RNA-seq with those of a previous microarray
   study performed on the same fish. Following de novo assembly, results
   showed that normal whitefish overexpressed more contigs associated with
   protein synthesis while dwarf fish overexpressed more contigs related to
   energy metabolism, immunity and DNA replication and repair. Moreover, 63
   SNPs showed significant allelic imbalance, and this phenomenon prevailed
   in the recently diverged dwarf whitefish. Results also showed an absence
   of correlation between gene expression divergence as measured by RNA-Seq
   and either polymorphism rate or sequence divergence between normal and
   dwarf whitefish. This study reiterates an important role for gene
   expression divergence, and provides evidence for allele-specific
   expression divergence as well as evolutionary decoupling of regulatory
   and coding sequences in the adaptive divergence of normal and dwarf
   whitefish. It also demonstrates how next-generation sequencing can lead
   to a more comprehensive understanding of transcriptomic divergence in a
   young species pair.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying congruence in the geographical position of lineage breaks
   and species range limits across multiple taxa is a focus of the field of
   comparative phylogeography. These regions are biogeographical hotspots
   for investigations into the processes driving divergence at multiple
   phylogenetic levels. We used spatially explicit statistical methods to
   identify these regions for amphibians across the United States.
   Significant clustering occurred in the Appalachian Mountains and in the
   general area of Alabama - a region underappreciated as an important
   amphibian hotspot. When the orders Caudata and Anura were examined
   separately, spatial clustering was still found in Alabama for both.
   However, in Caudata the Appalachians and California were also important,
   and for Anura, the Great Lakes region was highlighted. When species
   richness was statistically controlled, cluster hotspots shifted out of
   Alabama and the Appalachians and moved to broader swaths of the Great
   Lakes region, southwestern United States and California. The exact
   location of particular suture zones is probably a result of complex
   interactions between historical and ecological factors including
   physiography, climate and distance from glacial refugia. These contact
   zone and phylogeographical break hotspots are ideal arenas in which to
   test alternative speciation hypotheses and examine the extent of
   reproductive isolation using novel, integrative approaches combining
   modern methods in statistical phylogeography, ecological niche modelling
   and genomics.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a study of the Pipistrellus pipistrellus species
   complex, a highly diversified bat group with a radiation centre in the
   Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. The study sample comprised 583
   animals from 118 localities representatively covering the bats' range in
   the western Palearctic. We used fast-evolving markers (the mitochondrial
   D-loop sequence and 11 nuclear microsatellites) to describe the
   phylogeography, demography and population structure of this model taxon
   and address details of its diversification. The overall pattern within
   this group includes a mosaic of phylogenetically basal, often
   morphologically distant, relatively small and mostly allopatric demes in
   the Mediterranean Basin, as well as two sympatric sibling species in the
   large continental part of the range. The southern populations exhibit
   constant size, whereas northern populations show a demographic trend of
   growth associated with range expansion during the Pleistocene climate
   oscillations. There is evidence of isolation by distance and female
   philopatry in P. pipistrellus sensu stricto. Although the northern
   populations are reproductively isolated, we detected introgression
   events among several Mediterranean lineages. This pattern implies
   incomplete establishment of reproductive isolating mechanisms in these
   populations as well as the existence of a past reinforcement stage in
   the continental siblings. The occurrence of reticulations in the
   radiation centre among morphologically and ecologically derived relict
   demes suggests that adaptive unequal gene exchange within hybridizing
   populations could play a role in speciation and adaptive radiation
   within this group.}},

Abstract = {{Hotspots of intraspecific diversity have been observed in most species,
   often within areas of putative Pleistocene refugia. They have thus
   mostly been viewed as the outcome of prolonged stability of large
   populations within the refugia. However, recent evidence has suggested
   that several other microevolutionary processes could also be involved in
   their formation. Here, we investigate the contribution of these
   processes to current range-wide patterns of genetic diversity in the
   Italian endemic mole Talpa romana, using both nuclear (30 allozyme loci)
   and mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b sequences). Southern populations
   of this species showed an allozyme variation that is amongst the highest
   observed in small mammals (most populations had an expected
   heterozygosity of 0.10 or above), which was particularly unexpected for
   a subterranean species. Population genetic, phylogeographic and
   historical demographic analyses indicated that T. romana populations
   repeatedly underwent allopatric differentiations followed by secondary
   admixture within the refugial range in southern Italy. A prolonged
   demographic stability was reliably inferred from the mitochondrial DNA
   data only for a population group located north and east of the Calabrian
   peninsula, showing comparatively lower levels of allozyme variability,
   and lacking evidence of secondary admixture with other groups. Thus, our
   results point to the admixture between differentiated lineages as the
   main cause of the higher levels of diversity of refugial populations.
   When compared with the Pleistocene evolutionary history recently
   inferred for species from both the same and other geographic regions,
   these results suggest the need for a reappraisal of the role of gene
   exchange in the formation of intraspecific hotspots of genetic
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Strait of Gibraltar (SG) is reputed for being both a bridge and a
   geographic barrier to biological exchanges between Europe and Africa.
   Major genetic breaks associated with this strait have been identified in
   various taxa, but it is unknown whether these disjunctions have been
   produced simultaneously or by independent biogeographic processes. Here,
   the genetic structure of five conifers distributed on both sides of the
   SG was investigated using mitochondrial (nad1 b/c, nad5-1, nad5-4 and
   nad7-1) and chloroplast (Pt1254, Pt15169, Pt30204, Pt36480, Pt71936 and
   Pt87268) DNA markers. The distribution of genetic variation was
   partially congruent between types of markers within the same species.
   Across taxa, there was a significant overlapping between the SG and the
   genetic breaks detected, especially for the four Tertiary species
   surveyed (Abies pinsapo complex, Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster and Taxus
   baccata). For most of these taxa, the divergence of populations across
   the SG could date back to long before the Pleistocene glaciations.
   However, their strongly different cpDNA G(ST) and R-ST values point out
   that they have had dissimilar population histories, which might include
   contrasting amounts of pollen-driven gene flow since their initial
   establishment in the region. The fifth species, Pinus halepensis, was
   genetically depauperated and homogenous on both sides of the SG. A
   further analysis of nuclear DNA sequences with coalescent-based
   isolation with migration models suggests a Pleistocene divergence of P.
   halepensis populations across the SG, which is in sharp contrast with
   the pre-Pleistocene divergence dates obtained for P. pinaster.
   Altogether, these results indicate that the genetic breaks observed
   across this putative biogeographical barrier have been produced by
   independent evolutionary processes related to the biological history of
   each individual species instead of a common vicariant phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of the African tropical rainforests as a hotspot
   of biodiversity, their history and the processes that have structured
   their biodiversity are understood poorly. With respect to past
   demographic processes, new insights can be gained through characterizing
   the distribution of genetic diversity. However, few studies of this type
   have been conducted in Central Africa, where the identification of
   species in the field can be difficult. We examine here the distribution
   of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) diversity in Lower Guinea in two tree species
   that are difficult to distinguish, Erythrophleum ivorense and
   Erythrophleum suaveolens (Fabaceae). By using a blind-sampling approach
   and comparing molecular and morphological markers, we first identified
   retrospectively all sampled individuals and determined the limits of the
   distribution of each species. We then performed a phylogeographic study
   using the same genetic data set. The two species displayed essentially
   parapatric distributions that were correlated well with the rainfall
   gradient, which indicated different ecological requirements. In
   addition, a phylogeographic structure was found for E. suaveolens and,
   for both species, substantially higher levels of diversity and allelic
   endemism were observed in the south (Gabon) than in the north (Cameroon)
   of the Lower Guinea region. This finding indicated different histories
   of population demographics for the two species, which might reflect
   different responses to Quaternary climate changes. We suggest that a
   recent period of forest perturbation, which might have been caused by
   humans, favoured the spread of these two species and that their poor
   recruitment at present results from natural succession in their forest
   formations.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural transmission is thought to be a mechanism by which migratory
   animals settle into habitats, but little evidence exists in wild
   populations because of the difficulty of following individuals over
   successive generations and wide geographical distances. Cultural
   inheritance of migration routes represents a mechanism whereby
   geographical isolation can arise between separate groups and could
   constrain individuals to potentially suboptimal sites within their
   range. Conversely, adopting the parental migratory route in adult life,
   rather than dispersing randomly, may increase an individual's
   reproductive success because that strategy has already been proven to
   allow successful breeding. We combined a pedigree of related
   light-bellied Brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) with 6 years of
   observations of marked birds to calculate the dispersal distances of
   adult offspring from their parents in both Ireland and Iceland. In both
   countries, the majority of offspring were found to recruit into or near
   their parental sites, indicating migratory connectivity in the flyway.
   Despite this kin structure, we found no evidence of genetic
   differentiation using genotype data from 1127 individuals across 15
   microsatellite loci. We suggest that the existence of migratory
   connectivity of subpopulations is far more common than previous research
   indicates and that cultural information may play an important role in
   structuring reproductive isolation among them.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting ecology and population studies indicate that diamondback
   terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) exhibit nest site fidelity and high
   habitat fidelity. However, genetic studies indicate high levels of gene
   flow. Because dispersal affects the genetics and population dynamics of
   a species, we used six highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to
   investigate sex-biased dispersal and natal philopatry of M. terrapin in
   Barnegat Bay, NJ. We compared results of spatial autocorrelation
   analysis, assignment methods and Wright's FST estimators to a
   mark-recapture analysis. Mark-recapture analysis over a 4-year period
   indicated that most individuals have relatively small home ranges (<2
   km), with mature females displaying greater home ranges than males.
   Goodness of fit analysis of our mark-recapture study indicated that some
   juvenile males were likely transient individuals moving through our
   study location. Mean assignment indices and first-generation migrant
   tests indicated that mature males were more prone to disperse than
   mature females, but first-generation migrant tests indicated that per
   capita there are more female than male dispersers. Thus, the relative
   importance of males and females on gene flow in terrapin populations may
   change in relation to population sex ratios. Spatial autocorrelation
   analysis indicated that mature females exhibited natal philopatry to
   nesting beaches, but first-generation migrant tests indicated that a
   small number of females failed to nest on natal beaches. Finally, we
   discuss the important conservation implications of male-biased dispersal
   and natal philopatry in the diamondback terrapin.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific aggregations in terrestrial and aquatic organisms can have a
   significant effect on an individual's survival, growth and reproductive
   fitness, particularly if these aggregations are composed of closely
   related individuals. Such aggregations can form passively, as a
   consequence of dispersal, or actively, as a consequence of kin
   recognition. In this study, we investigated the genetic composition of
   individuals in conspecific aggregations in the simultaneous
   hermaphroditic marine bryozoan Bugula stolonifera. Conspecific larvae
   routinely metamorphose on adult colonies; the possibility that larvae
   select or avoid their maternal colony was investigated utilizing 10
   newly developed polymorphic microsatellite loci. Adult colonies were
   collected from Eel Pond, Woods Hole, Massachusetts and inspected for the
   presence of attached individuals. Adult colonies and their attached
   individuals were genotyped and compared to assess genetic relatedness
   within and among these groups relative to the overall genetic
   variability of the sampling site. Overall, the population of B.
   stolonifera at this site was found to be outside Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium because of significant levels of inbreeding. No significant
   genetic differentiation, however, was found between any groups,
   documenting that a group containing an adult colony and its attached
   individuals had as much genetic variability as was found for the entire
   sampling site. Parentage-exclusion analyses showed that the vast
   majority of attached individuals (>93\%) could not have derived from the
   colony on which they were attached. Kinship analyses showed that the
   majority of attached individuals (approximate to 63\%) shared less than
   a half-sibling relationship. These results suggest that a colony's
   nearest neighbours are not composed of siblings, and thus, larval
   settlement preference can maximize outcrossing in this inbreeding
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The general patterns of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the
   equator have been well documented for large terrestrial organisms such
   as plants and vertebrates but are largely unknown for microbiota. In
   contrast to macrobiota, microbiota have long been assumed to exhibit
   cosmopolitan, random distributions and a lack of spatial patterns. To
   evaluate the assumption, we conducted a survey of nematode diversity
   within the soil, litter and canopy habitats of the humid lowland
   tropical rainforest of Costa Rica using an ultrasequencing
   ecometagenetic approach at a species-equivalent taxonomic level. Our
   data indicate that both richness and diversity of nematode communities
   in the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica are high and exceed observed
   values from temperate ecosystems. The majority of nematode species were
   unknown to science, providing evidence for the presence of highly
   endemic (not cosmopolitan) species of still completely undiscovered
   biodiversity. Most importantly, the greater taxonomic resolution used
   here allowed us to reveal predictable habitat associations for specific
   taxa and thus gain insights into their nonrandom distribution patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The composition and dynamics of the gastrointestinal bacterial
   communities in birds is determined by both host-specific and
   environmental exposure factors yet these are poorly understood. We
   selected the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as the host species to
   examine the diversity and temporal stability of the faecal microflora in
   a bird, owing to its importance as a model organism in avian ecology,
   neuroscience and evolution studies. The stability of the gut bacterial
   community of individual male and female zebra finches was assessed
   through repeat faecal sampling via culture and temperature gradient gel
   electrophoresis and partial sequencing of PCR-amplified eubacterial 16S
   rRNA gene products. Nineteen bacterial genera were detected across all
   samples (n = 99), with each bird carrying on average six operational
   taxonomic units. Using a novel statistical approach, we showed that
   bacterial assemblages and community richness varied between individual
   birds but remained stable over time within individuals. Neither the
   composition nor richness of bacterial communities differed significantly
   between the sexes. Our results show that zebra finches housed together
   under controlled conditions show consistent variation between
   individuals in their gut microflora that is not attributable to
   differences in host exposure to environmental microbial sources. Future
   studies could usefully explore the origin of this individual-specific
   variation and its consequences for host fitness and sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens is
   determined largely by distribution patterns of mosquito bites among wild
   animal populations. Although mosquitoes are crucial for transmission of
   avian malaria parasites, little is known about the ecology of natural
   vectors. We examined bloodmeal and parasite incidence in Culex pipiens
   pallens by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure to
   determine how the feeding pattern of mosquitoes govern transmission
   dynamics of avian malaria parasites in Japanese wild birds. We collected
   881 unfed and 486 blood-fed Cx. pipiens pallens resting on vegetation in
   a park in Tokyo. The mosquitoes were separated into abdomen and thorax
   prior to PCR screening. Abdomens of unfed mosquitoes were combined into
   95 pools. From these, we amplified Plasmodium DNA in 32 (33.7\%) pools.
   Among blood-fed mosquitoes, 371 individuals were screened for
   blood-sources and Plasmodium parasites. Plasmodium DNA was amplified
   from mosquitoes fed on 6 of 13 avian species identified as
   blood-sources. Ten Plasmodium lineages were identified on the basis of
   478 bp of the cytochrome b gene, with 0.2-10\% sequence divergence. The
   three commonest Plasmodium lineages (CXPIP09, SGS1 and PADOM02) were
   detected in both the abdomens and thoraxes of mosquitoes, strongly
   suggesting transmission of these lineages. Jungle crow (Corvus
   macrorhynchos) served as a natural host for the three commonest
   Plasmodium lineages and made up 63.8\% of blood-sources. As a
   significant increase in feeding of vector mosquitoes on jungle crows
   coincided with their breeding season, jungle crows were considered to be
   the primary reservoir of Plasmodium transmission in this study.}},

Title = {{Quantifying microbial communities with 454 pyrosequencing: does read
   abundance count?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{5555-5565}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pyrosequencing technologies have revolutionized how we describe and
   compare complex microbial communities. In 454 pyrosequencing data sets,
   the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly
   interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for
   quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic
   biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing,
   however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative
   metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and
   biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known
   quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our
   results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among
   species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution
   gradient varied from R-2 of 0.96-0.54. Read-quality based processing
   stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing
   long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level
   composition of background environmental fungal communities determined
   from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning
   and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We
   conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within
   species, but between-species comparisons can be biased by innate
   sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence
   quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence
   processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing
   hypotheses using read abundance data.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial cycles have played a dominant role in shaping the genetic
   structure and distribution of biota in northwestern North America. The
   two major ice age refugia of Beringia and the Pacific Northwest were
   connected by major mountain chains and bordered by the Pacific Ocean. As
   a result, numerous refugial options were available for the regions taxa
   during glacial advances. We reviewed the importance of glaciations and
   refugia in shaping northwestern North America's phylogeographic history.
   We also tested whether ecological variables were associated with
   refugial history. The recurrent phylogeographic patterns that emerged
   were the following: (i) additional complexity, i.e. refugia within
   refugia, in both Beringia and the Pacific Northwest; and (ii) strong
   evidence for cryptic refugia in the Alexander Archipelago and Haida
   Gwaii, the Canadian Arctic and within the ice-sheets. Species with
   contemporary ranges that covered multiple refugia, or those with high
   dispersal ability, were significantly more likely to have resided in
   multiple refugia. Most of the shared phylogeographic patterns can be
   attributed to multiple refugial locales during the last glacial maximum
   or major physiographic barriers like rivers and glaciers. However, some
   of the observed patterns are much older and appear connected to the
   orogeny of the Cascade-Sierra chain or allopatric differentiation during
   historic glacial advances. The emergent patterns from this review
   suggest we should refine the classic Beringian-southern refugial
   paradigm for northwestern North American biota and highlight the
   ecological and evolutionary consequences of colonization from multiple
   refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Natural populations that evolve under extreme climates are likely to
   diverge because of selection in local environments. To explore whether
   local adaptation has occurred in redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss
   gairdneri) occupying differing climate regimes, we used a limited genome
   scan approach to test for candidate markers under selection in
   populations occurring in desert and montane streams. An environmental
   approach to identifying outlier loci, spatial analysis method and linear
   regression of minor allele frequency with environmental variables
   revealed six candidate markers (P < 0.01). Putatively neutral markers
   identified high genetic differentiation among desert populations
   relative to montane sites, likely due to intermittent flows in desert
   streams. Additionally, populations exhibited a highly significant
   pattern of isolation by temperature (P < 0.0001) and those adapted to
   the same environment had similar allele frequencies across candidate
   markers, indicating selection for differing climates. These results
   imply that many genes are involved in the adaptation of redband trout to
   differing environments, and selection acts to reinforce localization.
   The potential to predict genetic adaptability of individuals and
   populations to changing environmental conditions may have profound
   implications for species that face extensive anthropogenic disturbances.}},

Number = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the last decade, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have
   become one of the most widely used molecular markers to study the
   genetic structure of natural populations. Most of the statistical
   methods available to study the genetic structure of populations using
   AFLPs consider these markers as dominant and are thus unable to
   distinguish between individuals being heterozygous or homozygous for the
   dominant allele. Some attempts have been made to treat AFLPs as
   codominant markers by using AFLP band intensities to infer the most
   likely genotype of each individual. These two approaches have some
   drawbacks, the former discarding potentially valuable information and
   the latter being sometimes unable to correctly assign genotypes to
   individuals. In this study, we propose an alternative likelihood-based
   approach, which does not attempt at inferring the genotype of each
   individual, but rather incorporate the uncertainty about genotypes into
   a Bayesian framework leading to the estimation of population-specific
   FIS and FST coefficients. We show with simulations that the accuracy of
   our method is much higher than one using AFLP as dominant markers and is
   generally close to what would be obtained by using the same number of
   Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. The method is applied to a
   data set of four populations of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) from
   Grisons in Switzerland, for which we obtained 562 polymorphic AFLP
   markers. Our approach is very general and has the potential to make AFLP
   markers as useful as SNP data for nonmodel species.}},

Title = {{Distinguishing between population bottleneck and population subdivision

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4648-4660}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although most natural populations are genetically subdivided, they are
   often analysed as if they were panmictic units. In particular, signals
   of past demographic size changes are often inferred from genetic data by
   assuming that the analysed sample is drawn from a population without any
   internal subdivision. However, it has been shown that a bottleneck
   signal can result from the presence of some recent immigrants in a
   population. It thus appears important to contrast these two alternative
   scenarios in a model choice procedure to prevent wrong conclusions to be
   made. We use here an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to
   infer whether observed patterns of genetic diversity in a given sample
   are more compatible with it being drawn from a panmictic population
   having gone through some size change, or from one or several demes
   belonging to a recent finite island model. Simulations show that we can
   correctly identify samples drawn from a subdivided population in up to
   95\% of the cases for a wide range of parameters. We apply our model
   choice procedure to the case of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and
   find conclusive evidence that Western and Eastern chimpanzee samples are
   drawn from a spatially subdivided population.}},

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing debate on the scale of pelagic larval dispersal in
   promoting connectivity among populations of shallow, benthic marine
   organisms. The linearly arranged Hawaiian Islands are uniquely suited to
   study scales of population connectivity and have been used extensively
   as a natural laboratory in terrestrial systems. Here, we focus on
   Hawaiian populations of the lobe coral Porites lobata, an ecosystem
   engineer of shallow reefs throughout the Pacific. Patterns of recent
   gene flow and population structure in P. lobata samples (n = 318) from
   two regions, the Hawaiian Islands (n = 10 sites) and from their nearest
   neighbour Johnston Atoll, were analysed with nine microsatellite loci.
   Despite its massive growth form, similar to 6\% of the samples from both
   regions were the product of asexual reproduction via fragmentation.
   Cluster analysis and measures of genetic differentiation indicated that
   P. lobata from the Hawaiian Islands are strongly isolated from those on
   Johnston Atoll (F-ST = 0.311; P < 0.001), with the descendants of recent
   migrants (n = 6) being clearly identifiable. Within the Hawaiian
   Islands, P. lobata conforms to a pattern of isolation by distance. Here,
   over 37\% (P = 0.001) of the variation in genetic distance was explained
   by geographical distance. This pattern indicates that while the majority
   of ongoing gene flow in Hawaiian P. lobata occurs among geographically
   proximate reefs, inter-island distances are insufficient to generate
   strong population structure across the archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the degree of population connectivity and investigating
   factors driving genetic exchange at various geographical scales are
   essential to understanding population dynamics and spread potential of
   invasive species. Here, we explore these issues in the highly invasive
   vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, a species whose invasion history has
   been obscured by its poorly understood taxonomy and population genetics.
   Recent phylogenetic and comparative genomic studies suggest that C.
   intestinalis is a cryptic species complex consisting of at least three
   species. We reconstructed phylogenies based on both mitochondrial
   (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3-NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 region and
   NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene) and nuclear (internal transcribed
   spacer 1) sequences, results of which support four major phylogroups
   corresponding to the previously reported spA, spB and Ciona spp. (spC)
   as well as an undescribed cryptic species (spD). While spC and spD
   remain restricted to their native ranges in the Mediterranean Sea and
   Black Sea, respectively, the highly invasive species (spA and spB) have
   disjunct global distributions. Despite extensive interspecific
   divergences, we identified low phylogeographical structure within these
   two invasive species. Haplotype network analyses revealed comparatively
   limited mutation steps among haplotypes within each species. Population
   genetic analyses based on two mtDNA fragments and eight unlinked
   microsatellites illustrated relatively low population differentiation
   and high population connectivity at both regional and continental scales
   in the two invasive species. Human-mediated dispersal coupled with a
   high potential for natural dispersal is probably responsible for the
   observed genetic homogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The study of speciation has advanced considerably in the last decades
   because of the increased application of molecular tools. In particular,
   the quantification of gene flow between recently diverged species could
   be addressed. Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana diverged,
   probably allopatrically, from a common ancestor approximately 250 000
   years ago. However, these species share one mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   haplotype indicative of a recent episode of introgression. To study the
   extent of gene flow between these species, we took advantage of a large
   sample of D. mauritiana and employed a range of different markers, i.e.
   nuclear and mitochondrial sequences, and microsatellites. This allowed
   us to detect two new mtDNA haplotypes (MAU3 and MAU4). These haplotypes
   diverged quite recently from haplotypes of the siII group present in
   cosmopolitan populations of D. simulans. The mean divergence time of the
   most diverged haplotype (MAU4) is approximately 127 000 years, which is
   more than 100 000 years before the assumed speciation time.
   Interestingly, we also found some evidence for gene flow at the nuclear
   level because an excess of putatively neutral loci shows significantly
   reduced differentiation between D. simulans and D. mauritiana. Our
   results suggest that these species are exchanging genes more frequently
   than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of recent evolutionary processes is essential for the
   successful conservation and management of contemporary populations,
   especially where they concern the introduction or invasion of species
   outside their natural range. However, the potentially negative
   implications of intraspecific introductions and invasions have attracted
   less attention, although they also represent a potential threat to
   biodiversity, and are commonly facilitated through human activities. The
   European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a small cyprinid fish that
   decreased greatly in its distribution during the 1970s and 1980s and was
   subsequently included on many European conservation lists. This decline
   appears to have reversed, and the extent of its distribution now exceeds
   its former range. We used a combination of 12 microsatellite markers and
   cytochrome b sequences on a large data set (693 individuals) across the
   current range of the European bitterling to investigate possible
   scenarios for its colonization of Europe. We show that the inferred
   history of colonization of Europe was largely congruent between
   mitochondrial and nuclear markers. The most divergent mtDNA lineages
   occur in the Aegean region but probably are not reproductively isolated
   as the Aegean populations also displayed mtDNA haplotypes from other
   lineages and nuclear data indicated their close relationship to Danubian
   populations. Much of Europe is currently populated by descendants of two
   main lineages that came to natural secondary contact in western Europe.
   An approximate Bayesian computation analysis indicates different dates
   for admixture events among western and central European populations
   ranging from the last deglaciation (natural) to the last few centuries
   (human-assisted translocations).}},

Abstract = {{Rivers provide an excellent system to study interactions between
   patterns of biodiversity structure and ecological processes. In these
   environments, gene flow is restricted by the spatial hierarchy and
   temporal variation of connectivity within the drainage network. In the
   Australian arid zone, this variability is high and rivers often exist as
   isolated waterholes connected during unpredictable floods. These
   conditions cause boom/bust cycles in the population dynamics of taxa,
   but their influence on spatial genetic diversity is largely unknown. We
   used a landscape genetics approach to assess the effect of hydrological
   variability on gene flow, spatial population structure and genetic
   diversity in an Australian freshwater fish, Macquaria ambigua. Our
   analysis is based on microsatellite data of 590 samples from 26
   locations across the species range. Despite temporal isolation of
   populations, the species showed surprisingly high rates of dispersal,
   with population genetic structure only evident among major drainage
   basins. Within drainages, hydrological variability was a strong
   predictor of genetic diversity, being positively correlated with
   spring-time flow volume. We propose that increases in flow volume during
   spring stimulate recruitment booms and dispersal, boosting population
   size and genetic diversity. Although it is uncertain how the
   hydrological regime in arid Australia may change under future climate
   scenarios, management strategies for arid-zone fishes should mitigate
   barriers to dispersal and alterations to the natural flow regime to
   maintain connectivity and the species' evolutionary potential. This
   study contributes to our understanding of the influence of spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity on population and landscape processes.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions are rapid evolutionary events in which populations
   are usually subject to a founder event during introduction followed by
   rapid adaptation to the new environment. Molecular tools and Bayesian
   approaches have shown their utility in exploring different evolutionary
   scenarios regarding the invasion routes of introduced species. We
   examined the situation for the tobacco aphid, Myzus persicae nicotianae,
   a recently introduced aphid species in Chile. Using seven microsatellite
   loci and approximate Bayesian computation, we studied populations of the
   tobacco aphid sampled from several American and European countries,
   identifying the most likely source populations and tracking the route of
   introduction to Chile. Our population genetic data are consistent with
   available historical information, pointing to an introduction route of
   the tobacco aphid from Europe and/or from other putative populations (e.
   g. Asia) with subsequent introduction through North America to South
   America. Evidence of multiple introductions to North America from
   different genetic pools, with successive loss of genetic diversity from
   Europe towards North America and a strong bottleneck during the
   southward introduction to South America, was also found. Additionally,
   we examined the special case of a widespread multilocus genotype that
   was found in all American countries examined. This case provides further
   evidence for the existence of highly successful genotypes or
   `superclones' in asexually reproducing organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic diversity and population structure of Arabidopsis thaliana
   populations from Norway were studied and compared to a worldwide sample
   of A. thaliana to investigate the demographic history and elucidate
   possible colonization routes of populations at the northernmost species
   limit. We genotyped 282 individuals from 31 local populations using 149
   single nucleotide polymorphism markers. A high level of population
   subdivision (F(ST) = 0.85 +/- 0.007) was found indicating that A.
   thaliana is highly structured at the regional level. Significant
   relationships between genetic and geographical distances were found,
   suggesting an isolation by distance mode of evolution. Genetic diversity
   was much lower, and the level of linkage disequilibrium was higher in
   populations from the north (65-68 degrees N) compared to populations
   from the south (59-62 degrees N); this is consistent with a northward
   expansion pattern. A neighbour-joining tree showed that populations from
   northern Norway form a separate cluster, while the remaining populations
   are distributed over a few minor clusters. Minimal gene flow seems to
   have occurred between populations in different regions, especially
   between the geographically distant northern and southern populations.
   Our data suggest that northern populations represent a homogenous group
   that may have been established from a few founders during northward
   expansions, while populations in the central part of Norway constitute
   an admixed group established by founders of different origins, most
   probably as a result of human-mediated gene flow. Moreover, Norwegian
   populations appeared to be homogenous and isolated compared to a
   worldwide sample of A. thaliana, but they are still grouped with Swedish
   populations, which may indicate common colonization histories.}},

Abstract = {{There has been much debate over the origin of species diversity in
   biodiversity hotspots, particularly the rate of speciation over
   extinction and the geographic mode of speciation. Here, we looked at
   speciation with varying degrees of sympatry in a biodiversity hotspot,
   focusing on a distinct morphological clade in the Cape Floristic Region
   in southern Africa, the Gladiolus carinatus species complex (Iridaceae).
   We investigate the mechanisms involved in population and species
   differentiation through a combination of ecological and genomic
   approaches. We estimated spatial and phenological overlap, differences
   in floral morphology, genetic isolation and genomic selection. A genetic
   coalescent analysis estimated that the time of divergence between
   lineages followed the establishment of available habitat in the Cape
   littoral plain where these species currently overlap geographically.
   Marked shifts in flowering time and morphology, which act as barriers to
   gene flow, have developed to varying degrees over the last 0.3-1.4
   million years. An amplified fragment length polymorphism genome scan
   revealed signatures of divergent and balancing selection, although half
   of the loci consistently behaved neutrally. Divergent species outliers
   (1\%) and floral morph outliers (3\%) represent a small proportion of
   the genome, but these loci produced clear genetic clusters of species
   and significant associations with floral traits. These results indicate
   that the G. carinatus complex represents a continuum of recent
   speciation. We provide further evidence for ecological adaptation in the
   face of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Rodents of the Praomys daltoni complex are typical inhabitants of the
   Sudanian savanna ecosystem in western Africa and represent a suitable
   model for testing the effects of Quaternary climatic oscillations on
   extant genetic variation patterns. Phylogeographical analyses of
   mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b) across the distribution range
   of the complex revealed several well-defined clades that do not support
   the division of the clade into the two species currently recognized on
   the basis of morphology, i.e. P. daltoni (Thomas, 1892) and Praomys
   derooi (Van der Straeten \& Verheyen 1978). The observed genetic
   structure fits the refuge hypothesis, suggesting that only a small
   number of populations repeatedly survived in distinct forest-savanna
   mosaic blocks during the arid phases of the Pleistocene, and then
   expanded again during moister periods. West African rivers may also have
   contributed to genetic differentiation, especially by forming barriers
   after secondary contact of expanding populations. The combination of
   three types of genetic markers (mtDNA sequences, microsatellite loci,
   cytogenetic data) provides evidence for the presence of up to three
   lineages, which most probably represent distinct biological species.
   Furthermore, incongruence between nuclear and mtDNA markers in some
   individuals unambiguously points towards a past introgression event. Our
   results highlight the importance of combining different molecular
   markers for an accurate interpretation of genetic data.}},

Abstract = {{The diversification of neotenic beetle lineages has not been studied,
   despite the potential for defining biodiversity hotspots and elucidating
   the history of regional faunas. Additionally, neotenics may provide
   insight into the process of speciation in small populations with
   extremely low dispersal ability and a limited range. Here, we used two
   rDNA and three mtDNA markers to investigate the phylogeny of Scarelus, a
   neotenic lineage endemic to Southeast Asian rainforests. Most genetic
   differentiation was associated with Palaeogene geographical divisions,
   which remain distinct despite temporary connections. Dispersal events
   were rare, with only two inferred for Scarelus: from Borneo to the
   Philippines 28.3 million years ago (Ma) and from Sumatra to Java 13.9
   Ma. We suggest that speciation resulted from allopatric range
   fragmentation, and Scarelus diversified readily when conditions were
   favourable; in this case, at different times in the eastern (19.3-39.1
   Ma) and western (3.5-13.9 Ma) parts of Sundaland. The observed strong
   phenotypic similarity was preserved under speciation through complete
   allopatry. Neotenic Lycidae have survived for a long time in very stable
   habitats, and extremely low dispersal activity has not limited their
   persistence; however, the long-term diversification rate of neotenics is
   low and diversification is nonexistent under stable conditions. The
   modern ranges of neotenic lineages are indicative of ancient rainforest
   refugia and may be used in biodiversity conservation management. Most
   neotenics are at risk of extinction because of their small ranges and a
   low dispersal potential.}},

Abstract = {{For many taxa, introgression represents an important source of genetic
   variation, but the specific contexts allowing locally introgressed
   material to spread and largely replace native allelic lineages
   throughout a species range remain poorly understood. Recent
   demographic-genetic simulations of spatial expansions show that the
   stochastic surfing of alien alleles during range expansions may
   constitute a general mechanism leading to extensive introgression, but
   empirical evidence remain scarce and difficult to distinguish from
   selection. In this study, we report a compelling case of such a
   phenomenon in the estuarine alga Fucus ceranoides. We re-assessed the
   phylogenetic relationships among F. ceranoides and its marine congeners
   F. vesiculosus and F. spiralis using nuclear, mitochondrial and
   chloroplast sequence data, and conducted a mtDNA phylogeographic survey
   in F. ceranoides. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed a recent and
   asymmetric introgression of a single F. vesiculosus cytoplasm into F.
   ceranoides. The phylogeographic scope of introgression was striking,
   with native and introgressed mtDNA displaying disjunct distributions
   south and north of the English Channel. A putative Pleistocene climatic
   refugium was detected in NW Iberia, and the extensive and exclusive
   spread of the alien cytoplasm throughout Northern Europe was inferred to
   have occurred concurrently with the species post-glacial, northwards
   range expansion. This massive spread of a foreign organelle throughout
   the entire post-glacial recolonization range represents good empirical
   evidence of an alien cytoplasm surfing the wave of a range expansion and
   the first description of such a phenomenon in the marine realm.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining quantitative information concerning pollinator behaviour has
   become a primary objective of pollination studies, but methodological
   limitations hinder progress towards this goal. Here, we use molecular
   genetic methods in an ecological context to demonstrate that endemic
   Hawaiian Hylaeus bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) selectively collect
   pollen from native plant species in Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes
   National Parks. We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal
   storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3
   years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite
   the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each
   study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from
   more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword
   (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86\% of all
   pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both
   parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae)
   pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in
   flower during our study. Furthermore, 100\% of Hylaeus crops from which
   we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The
   molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level
   information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not
   require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput
   visual pollen identification. Building upon this approach, future
   studies can thus develop appropriate and customized criteria for
   assessing mixed pollen loads from a broader range of sources and from
   other global regions.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation biologists understand that linking demographic histories of
   species at risk with causal biotic and abiotic events should help us
   predict the effects of ongoing biotic and abiotic change. In parallel,
   researchers have started to use ancient genetic information (aDNA) to
   explore the demographic histories of a number of species present in the
   Pleistocene fossil record (see, e. g. Shapiro et al. 2004). However,
   aDNA studies have primarily focused on identifying long-term population
   trends, linked to climate variability and the role of early human
   activity. Population trends over more recent time, e. g. during the
   Holocene, have been poorly explored, partly owing to analytical
   limitations. In this issue, Campos et al. (2010a) highlight the
   potential of aDNA to investigate demographic patterns over such recent
   time periods for the compelling and endangered saiga antelope Saiga
   tatarica (Fig. 1). The time may come when past and current demography
   can be combined to produce a seamless record.}},

Abstract = {{Explosive speciation in ancient lakes has fascinated biologists for
   centuries and has inspired classical work on the tempo and modes of
   speciation. Considerable attention has been directed towards the
   extrinsic forces of speciation-the geological, geographical and
   ecological peculiarities of ancient lakes. Recently, there has been a
   resurgence of interest in the intrinsic nature of these radiations, the
   biological characteristics conducive to speciation. While new species
   are thought to arise mainly by the gradual enhancement of reproductive
   isolation among geographically isolated populations, ancient lakes
   provide little evidence for a predominant role of geography in
   speciation. Recent phylogenetic work provides strong evidence that
   multiple colonization waves were followed by parallel intralacustrine
   radiations that proceeded at relatively rapid rates despite long-term
   gene flow through hybridization and introgression. Several studies
   suggest that hybridization itself might act as a key evolutionary
   mechanism by triggering major genomic reorganization/revolution and
   enabling the colonization of new ecological niches in ancient lakes.
   These studies propose that hybridization is not only of little
   impediment to diversification but could act as an important force in
   facilitating habitat transitions, promoting postcolonization adaptations
   and accelerating diversification. Emerging ecological genomic approaches
   are beginning to shed light on the long-standing evolutionary dilemma of
   speciation in the face of gene flow. We propose an integrative programme
   for future studies on speciation in ancient lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular markers, such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci,
   are widely studied to assess population genetics and phylogeography;
   however, the selective neutrality of these markers is increasingly being
   questioned. Given the importance of molecular markers in fisheries
   science and conservation, we evaluated the neutrality of both mtDNA and
   microsatellite loci through their associations with population size. We
   surveyed mtDNA and microsatellite data from the primary literature and
   determined whether genetic diversity increased with abundance across a
   total of 105 marine and freshwater fishes, with both global fisheries
   catch data and body size as proxies for abundance ( with an additional
   57 species for which only body size data were assessed). We found that
   microsatellite data generally yielded higher associations with abundance
   than mtDNA data, and within mtDNA analyses, number of haplotypes and
   haplotype diversity were more strongly associated with abundance than
   nucleotide diversity, particularly for freshwater fishes. We compared
   genetic diversity between freshwater and marine fishes and found that
   marine fishes had higher values of all measures of genetic diversity
   than freshwater fishes. Results for both mtDNA and microsatellites
   generally conformed to neutral expectations, although weaker
   relationships were often found between mtDNA nucleotide diversity and
   `abundance' compared to any other genetic statistic. We speculate that
   this is because of historical events unrelated to natural selection,
   although a role for selection cannot be ruled out.}},

Title = {{Ancient DNA sequences point to a large loss of mitochondrial genetic

Abstract = {{Prior to the Holocene, the range of the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica)
   spanned from France to the Northwest Territories of Canada. Although its
   distribution subsequently contracted to the steppes of Central Asia,
   historical records indicate that it remained extremely abundant until
   the end of the Soviet Union, after which its populations were reduced by
   over 95\%. We have analysed the mitochondrial control region sequence
   variation of 27 ancient and 38 modern specimens, to assay how the
   species' genetic diversity has changed since the Pleistocene.
   Phylogenetic analyses reveal the existence of two well-supported, and
   clearly distinct, clades of saiga. The first, spanning a time range from
   >49 500 C-14 ybp to the present, comprises all the modern specimens and
   ancient samples from the Northern Urals, Middle Urals and Northeast
   Yakutia. The second clade is exclusive to the Northern Urals and
   includes samples dating from between 40 400 to 10 250 C-14 ybp. Current
   genetic diversity is much lower than that present during the
   Pleistocene, an observation that data modelling using serial coalescent
   indicates cannot be explained by genetic drift in a population of
   constant size. Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses show the
   observed data is more compatible with a drastic population size
   reduction (c. 66-77\%) following either a demographic bottleneck in the
   course of the Holocene or late Pleistocene, or a geographic
   fragmentation (followed by local extinction of one subpopulation) at the
   Holocene/Pleistocene transition.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of genetic diversity is a product of recent and
   historical ecological processes, as well as anthropogenic activities. A
   current challenge in population and conservation genetics is to
   disentangle the relative effects of these processes, as a first step in
   predicting population response to future environmental change. In this
   investigation, we compare the influence of contemporary population
   decline, contemporary ecological marginality and postglacial range
   shifts. Using classical model comparison procedures and Bayesian
   methods, we have identified postglacial range shift as the clear
   determinant of genetic diversity, differentiation and bottlenecks in 29
   populations of butternut, Juglans cinerea L., a North American
   outcrossing forest tree. Although butternut has experienced dramatic
   20th century decline because of an introduced fungal pathogen, our
   analysis indicates that recent population decline has had less genetic
   impact than postglacial recolonization history. Location within the
   range edge vs. the range core also failed to account for the observed
   patterns of diversity and differentiation. Our results suggest that the
   genetic impact of large-scale recent population losses in forest trees
   should be considered in the light of Pleistocene-era large-scale range
   shifts that may have had long-term genetic consequences. The data also
   suggest that the population dynamics and life history of wind-pollinated
   forest trees may provide a buffer against steep population declines of
   short duration, a result having important implications for habitat
   management efforts, ex situ conservation sampling and population
   viability analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how crop species spread and are introduced to new areas
   provides insights into the nature of species range expansions. The
   domesticated species Oryza sativa or Asian rice is one of the key
   domesticated crop species in the world. The island of Madagascar off the
   coast of East Africa was one of the last major Old World areas of
   introduction of rice after the domestication of this crop species and
   before extensive historical global trade in this crop. Asian rice was
   introduced in Madagascar from India, the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia
   approximately 800-1400 years ago. Studies of domestication traits
   characteristic of the two independently domesticated Asian rice
   subspecies, indica and tropical japonica, suggest two major waves of
   migrations into Madagascar. A population genetic analysis of rice in
   Madagascar using sequence data from 53 gene fragments provided insights
   into the dynamics of island founder events during the expansion of a
   crop species' geographic range and introduction to novel agro-ecological
   environments. We observed a significant decrease in genetic diversity in
   rice from Madagascar when compared to those in Asia, likely the result
   of a bottleneck on the island. We also found a high frequency of a
   unique indica type in Madagascar that shows clear population
   differentiation from most of the sampled Asian landraces, as well as
   differential exchange of alleles between Asia and Madagascar populations
   of the tropical japonica subspecies. Finally, despite partial
   reproductive isolation between japonica and indica, there was evidence
   of indica/japonica recombination resulting from their hybridization on
   the island.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may disrupt original patterns of gene flow and
   lead to drift-induced differentiation among local population units. Top
   predators such as the jaguar may be particularly susceptible to this
   effect, given their low population densities, leading to small effective
   sizes in local fragments. On the other hand, the jaguar's high dispersal
   capabilities and relatively long generation time might counteract this
   process, slowing the effect of drift on local populations over the time
   frame of decades or centuries. In this study, we have addressed this
   issue by investigating the genetic structure of jaguars in a recently
   fragmented Atlantic Forest region, aiming to test whether loss of
   diversity and differentiation among local populations are detectable,
   and whether they can be attributed to the recent effect of drift. We
   used 13 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic diversity
   present in four remnant populations, and observed marked differentiation
   among them, with evidence of recent allelic loss in local areas.
   Although some migrant and admixed individuals were identified, our
   results indicate that recent large-scale habitat removal and
   fragmentation among these areas has been sufficiently strong to promote
   differentiation induced by drift and loss of alleles at each site. Low
   estimated effective sizes supported the inference that genetic drift
   could have caused this effect within a short time frame. These results
   indicate that jaguars' ability to effectively disperse across the
   human-dominated landscapes that separate the fragments is currently very
   limited, and that each fragment contains a small, isolated population
   that is already suffering from the effects of genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, there is concern over the decline of bees, an ecologically
   important group of pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights
   into population structure that are crucial for conservation management
   but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological
   methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily
   focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary
   bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes
   floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and
   Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was
   surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the
   extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish
   populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among
   populations was detected; multilocus F-ST was up to 0.53, and G'(ST) and
   D-est were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern
   of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water
   appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated
   by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations
   are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift
   equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as
   a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight
   the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline
   of this and potentially other rare solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity vary among
   species. This may be attributed to the interacting effects of species
   traits and landscape structure. While widely distributed and abundant
   species are often considered less susceptible to fragmentation, this may
   be different if they are small sized and show limited dispersal. Under
   intensive land use, habitat fragmentation may reach thresholds at which
   gene flow among populations of small-sized and dispersal-limited species
   becomes disrupted. Here, we studied the genetic diversity of two
   abundant and widespread bush crickets along a gradient of habitat
   fragmentation in an agricultural landscape. We applied traditional
   (G(ST), theta) and recently developed (G'(ST), D) estimators of genetic
   differentiation on microsatellite data from each of twelve populations
   of the grassland species Metrioptera roeselii and the forest-edge
   species Pholidoptera griseoaptera to identify thresholds of habitat
   fragmentation below which genetic population structure is affected.
   Whereas the grassland species exhibited a uniform genetic structuring
   (G(ST) = 0.020-0.033; D = 0.085-0.149) along the whole fragmentation
   gradient, the forest-edge species' genetic differentiation increased
   significantly from D < 0.063 (G(ST) < 0.018) to D = 0.166 (G(ST) =
   0.074), once the amount of suitable habitat dropped below a threshold of
   20\% and its proximity decreased substantially at the landscape scale.
   The influence of fragmentation on genetic differentiation was
   qualitatively unaffected by the choice of estimators of genetic
   differentiation but quantitatively underestimated by the traditional
   estimators. These results indicate that even for widespread species in
   modern agricultural landscapes fragmentation thresholds exist at which
   gene flow among suitable habitat patches becomes restricted.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the spatial distribution of genetic diversity to infer gene
   flow for Baillonella toxisperma Pierre (Moabi), a threatened
   entomophilous pollinated and animal-dispersed Central African tree, with
   typically low density (5-7 adults trees/km(2)). Fifteen nuclear and
   three universal chloroplast microsatellites markers were used to type
   247 individuals localized in three contiguous areas with differing past
   logging intensity. These three areas were within a natural forest block
   of approximately 2886 km(2) in Gabon. Expected heterozygosity and
   chloroplast diversity were He(nuc) = 0.570 and H(cp) = 0.761,
   respectively. F(IS) was only significant in one area (F(IS) = 0.076, P <
   0.01) and could be attributed to selfing. For nuclear loci, Bayesian
   clustering did not detect discrete gene pools within and between the
   three areas and global differentiation (F(STnuc) = 0.007, P > 0.05) was
   not significant, suggesting that they are one population. At the level
   of the whole forest, both nuclear and chloroplast markers revealed a
   weak correlation between genetic relatedness and spatial distance
   between individuals: Sp(nuc) = 0.003 and Sp(cp) = 0.015, respectively.
   The extent of gene flow (sigma) was partitioned into global gene flow
   (sigma(g)) from 6.6 to 9.9 km, seed dispersal (sigma(s)) from 4.0 to 6.3
   km and pollen dispersal (sigma(p)) from 9.8 to 10.8 km. These uncommonly
   high dispersal distances indicate that low-density canopy trees in
   African rainforests could be connected by extensive gene flow, although,
   given the current threats facing many seed disperser species in Central
   Africa, this may no longer be the case.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to ecologically distinct environments can coincide with the
   emergence of reproductive barriers. The outcome of this process is
   highly variable and can range along a continuum from weak population
   differentiation all the way to complete, genome-wide divergence. The
   factors determining how far diverging taxa will move along this
   continuum remain poorly understood but are most profitably investigated
   in taxa under replicate divergence. Here, we explore determinants of
   progress towards speciation by comparing phenotypic and molecular
   divergence within young (<150 years) lake-stream stickleback pairs from
   Central Europe to divergence in older (thousands of years) archetypal
   lake-stream pairs from Vancouver Island, Canada. We generally find
   relatively weak divergence in most aspects of foraging morphology (gill
   raker number, body shape) in the European pairs, although substantial
   adaptive divergence is seen in gill raker length. Combined with striking
   overall phenotypic differences between the continents, this argues for
   genetic and time constraints on adaptive divergence in the European
   pairs. The European lake-stream pairs also do not display the strong
   habitat-related differentiation in neutral (microsatellite) markers seen
   in the Canadian watersheds. This indicates either the lack of strong
   reproductive barriers owing to weak adaptive divergence, or
   alternatively that neutral markers are poorly suited for detecting
   reproductive barriers if these emerge rapidly. Overall, our comparative
   approach suggests constraints on speciation due to genetic architecture
   and limited time for divergence. The relative importance of these
   factors remains to be quantified by future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated two hypotheses for the origin of the root rot fungus
   Heterobasidion annosum species complex: (i) that geology has been an
   important factor for the speciation (ii) that co-evolutionary processes
   with the hosts drove the divergence of the pathogen species. The H.
   annosum species complex consists of five species: three occur in Europe,
   H. annosum s.s., Heterobasidion parviporum and Heterobasidion abietinum,
   and two in North America, Heterobasidion irregulare and Heterobasidion
   occidentale; all with different but partially overlapping host
   preferences. The evolution of the H. annosum species complex was studied
   using six partially sequenced genes, between 10 and 30 individuals of
   each species were analysed. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed for
   each gene, and a Bayesian tree was built for the combined data set. In
   addition, haplotype networks were constructed to illustrate the species
   relationships. For three of the genes, H. parviporum and H. abietinum
   share haplotypes supporting recent divergence and/or possible gene flow.
   We propose that the H. annosum species complex originated in Laurasia
   and that the H. annosum s.s./H. irregulare and H. parviporum/H.
   abietinum/H. occidentale ancestral species emerged between 45 and 60 Ma
   in the Palaearctic, well after the radiation of the host genera. Our
   data imply that H. irregulare and H. occidentale were colonizing North
   America via different routes. In conclusion, plate tectonics are likely
   to have been the main factor influencing Heterobasidion speciation and
   biogeography.}},

Abstract = {{Truffles (Tuber) are ectomycorrhizal fungi characterized by hypogeous
   fruitbodies. Their biodiversity, host associations and geographical
   distributions are not well documented. ITS rDNA sequences of Tuber are
   commonly recovered from molecular surveys of fungal communities, but
   most remain insufficiently identified making it difficult to determine
   whether these sequences represent conspecific or novel taxa. In this
   meta-analysis, over 2000 insufficiently identified Tuber sequences from
   76 independent studies were analysed within a phylogenetic framework.
   Species ranges, host associates, geographical distributions and
   intra-and interspecific ITS variability were assessed. Over 99\% of the
   insufficiently identified Tuber sequences grouped within clades composed
   of species with little culinary value (Maculatum, Puberulum and Rufum).
   Sixty-four novel phylotypes were distinguished including 36 known only
   from ectomycorrhizae or soil. Most species of Tuber showed 1-3\%
   intraspecific ITS variability and >4\% interspecific ITS sequence
   variation. We found 123 distinct phylotypes based on 96\% ITS sequence
   similarity and estimated that Tuber contains a minimum of 180 species.
   Based on this meta-analysis, species in Excavatum, Maculatum and Rufum
   clades exhibit preference for angiosperm hosts, whereas those in the
   Gibbosum clade are preferential towards gymnosperms. Sixteen Tuber
   species (>13\% of the known diversity) have putatively been introduced
   to continents or islands outside their native range.}},

Abstract = {{Previous phylogeographical and palaeontological studies on the biota of
   northern North America have revealed a complex scenario of glacial
   survival in multiple refugia and differing patterns of postglacial
   recolonization. Many putative refugial regions have been proposed both
   north and south of the ice sheets for species during the Last Glacial
   Maximum, but the locations of many of these refugia remain a topic of
   great debate. In this study, we used a phylogeographical approach to
   elucidate the refugial and recolonization history of the herbaceous
   plant species Orthilia secunda in North America, which is found in
   disjunct areas in the west and east of the continent, most of which were
   either glaciated or lay close to the limits of the ice sheets. Analysis
   of 596 bp of the chloroplast trnS-trnG intergenic spacer and five
   microsatellite loci in 84 populations spanning the species' range in
   North America suggests that O. secunda persisted through the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM) in western refugia, even though palaeodistribution
   modelling indicated a suitable climate envelope across the entire south
   of the continent. The present distribution of the species has resulted
   from recolonization from refugia north and south of the ice sheets, most
   likely in Beringia or coastal regions of Alaska and British Columbia,
   the Washington/Oregon region in the northwest USA, and possibly from the
   region associated with the putative `ice-free corridor' between the
   Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Our findings also highlight the
   importance of the Pacific Northwest as an important centre of
   intraspecific genetic diversity, owing to a combination of refugial
   persistence in the area and recolonization from other refugia.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Most relatives of the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic nematode model
   organism Caenorhabditis elegans reproduce via obligate outbreeding
   between males and females, which also represents the ancestral mode of
   reproduction within the genus. However, little is known about the scope
   of genetic diversity and differentiation within such gonochoristic
   species, especially those found outside of temperate Europe and North
   America. It is critical to understand the evolutionary processes
   operating in these species to provide a framework for deciphering the
   evolution of hermaphroditism and a baseline for the application of
   outcrossing Caenorhabditis to problems in evolutionary genetics. Here,
   we investigate for the first time molecular sequence variation for
   Caenorhabditis sp. 5, a species found commonly in eastern Asia. We
   identify enormous levels of standing genetic variation that approach the
   levels observed in the marine broadcast-spawning sea squirt, Ciona
   savignyi. Although we document significant isolation by distance, we
   demonstrate that the high polymorphism within C. sp. 5 is not because of
   strong differentiation among populations or to the presence of cryptic
   species. These findings illustrate that molecular population genetic
   approaches to studying obligately outbreeding species of Caenorhabditis
   will prove powerful in identifying and characterizing functionally and
   evolutionarily important features of the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Hypotheses of diversification in eastern North American freshwater
   fishes have focused primarily on allopatric distributions of species
   between disjunct highland areas and major river systems. However, these
   hypotheses do not fully explain the rich diversity of species within
   highland regions and river systems. Relatively old diversification
   events at small geographic scales have been observed in the Barcheek
   Darter subclade that occurs in the Cumberland River drainage (CRD) in
   Kentucky and Tennessee, United States of America, but it is unknown if
   this pattern is consistent in other darter subclades. We explored
   phylogeographic diversity in two species of Nothonotus darters, N.
   microlepidus and N. sanguifluus, endemic to the CRD to compare
   phylogenetic patterns between Barcheek Darters and species of
   Nothonotus. We collected sequence data for a mitochondrial gene (cytb)
   and three nuclear genes (MLL, S7 and RAG1) from 19 N. microlepidus and
   35 N. sanguifluus specimens. Gene trees were estimated using maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian methods, and a `species tree' was inferred using
   a Bayesian method. These trees indicate that species diversity in
   Nothonotus is underestimated. Five distinct lineages were evident,
   despite retained ancestral polymorphism and unsampled extirpated
   populations. Comparison of chronograms for Barcheek Darters and
   Nothonotus revealed that microendemism resulting from species
   diversification at small geographic scales in the CRD is a consistent
   pattern in both old and young darter subclades. Our analyses reveal that
   geographic isolating mechanisms that result in similar phylogeographic
   patterns in the CRD are persistent through long expanses of evolutionary
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Coalescent samplers are computational time machines for inferring the
   historical demographic genetic processes that have given rise to
   observable patterns of spatial genetic variation among contemporary
   populations. We have used traditional characterizations of population
   structure and coalescent-based inferences about demographic processes to
   reconstruct the population histories of two co-distributed marine
   species, the frilled dog whelk, Nucella lamellosa, and the bat star,
   Patiria miniata. Analyses of population structure were consistent with
   previous work in both species except that additional samples of N.
   lamellosa showed a larger regional genetic break on Vancouver Island
   (VI) rather than between the southern Alexander Archipelago as in P.
   miniata. Our understanding of the causes, rather than just the patterns,
   of spatial genetic variation was dramatically improved by coalescent
   analyses that emphasized variation in population divergence times.
   Overall, gene flow was greater in bat stars (planktonic development)
   than snails (benthic development) but spatially homogeneous within
   species. In both species, these large phylogeographic breaks
   corresponded to relatively ancient divergence times between populations
   rather than regionally restricted gene flow. Although only N. lamellosa
   shows a large break on VI, population separation times on VI are
   congruent between species, suggesting a similar response to late
   Pleistocene ice sheet expansion. The absence of a phylogeographic break
   in P. miniata on VI can be attributed to greater gene flow and larger
   effective population size in this species. Such insights put the
   relative significance of gene flow into a more comprehensive historical
   biogeographic context and have important implications for conservation
   and landscape genetic studies that emphasize the role of contemporary
   gene flow and connectivity in shaping patterns of population
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic markers are widely used to determine the parentage of
   individuals in studies of mating systems, reproductive success,
   dispersals, quantitative genetic parameters and in the management of
   conservation populations. These markers are, however, imperfect for
   parentage analyses because of the presence of genotyping errors and
   undetectable alleles, which may cause incompatible genotypes
   (mismatches) between parents and offspring and thus result in false
   exclusions of true parentage. Highly polymorphic markers widely used in
   parentage analyses, such as microsatellites, are especially prone to
   genotyping errors. In this investigation, I derived the probabilities of
   excluding a random (related) individual from parentage and the
   probabilities of Mendelian-inconsistent errors (mismatches) and
   Mendelian-consistent errors (which do not cause mismatches) in
   parent-offspring dyads, when a marker having null alleles, allelic
   dropouts and false alleles is used in a parentage analysis. These
   probabilities are useful in evaluating the impact of various types of
   genotyping errors on the information content of a set of markers in and
   thus the power of a parentage analysis, in determining the threshold
   number of genetic mismatches that is appropriate for a parentage
   exclusion analysis and in estimating the rates of genotyping errors and
   frequencies of null alleles from observed mismatches between known
   parent-offspring dyads. These applications are demonstrated by numerical
   examples using both hypothetical and empirical data sets and discussed
   in the context of practical parentage exclusion analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have become the
   target of choice for studies wishing to examine adaptively important
   genetic diversity in natural populations. Within Molecular Ecology
   alone, there have been 71 papers on aspects of MHC evolution over the
   past few years, with an increasing year on year trend. This focus on the
   MHC is partly driven by the hypothesized links between MHC gene dynamics
   and ecologically interesting and relevant traits, such as mate choice
   and host-parasite interactions. However, an ability to pin down the
   evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of MHC variation in
   natural populations has proven challenging and has been hampered by the
   very issue that is attractive about MHC genes - their high levels of
   diversity. Linking high levels of MHC diversity to ecological factors in
   inherently complex natural populations requires a level of experimental
   design and analytical rigour that is extremely difficult to achieve
   owing to a plethora of potentially confounding and interacting
   variables. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Smith et al. (2010)
   elegantly overcome the challenge of detecting complex interactions in
   complex systems by using an intricate analytical approach to demonstrate
   a role for MHC in the reproductive ability of a natural population of
   the European hare Lepus europaeus (Fig. 1). Also in this issue, Oppelt
   et al. (2010) demonstrate a role for MHC variation in determining levels
   of hepatic coccidian infection in the European rabbit Oryctolagus

Abstract = {{Gravity is the one constant, ubiquitous force that has shaped life on
   Earth over its 4.8 billion years of evolution. But the sheer
   inescapability of Earth's gravitational pull has meant that its
   influence on Earth's organisms is difficult to study. Neutralization of
   the gravity vector (so-called simulated microgravity) by random movement
   in three-dimensional space is the best option for Earth-based
   experiments, with spaceflight alone offering the possibility to assess
   the effects of an extremely reduced gravitational field (microgravity).
   However, the technical constraints associated with spaceflight introduce
   complications that can compromise the interpretation of microgravity
   experiments. It can be unclear whether changes detected in these
   experiments reflect additional spaceflight-related stresses (temperature
   shifts, vibrational effects, radiation exposure, and so on) as opposed
   to the loss of gravitational force per se. In this issue, Herranz et al.
   (2010) report a careful study in which the effects of simulated and
   actual microgravity on gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster were
   compared and the effects of the flight-associated stresses on the
   microgravity responses were investigated. A striking finding emerged.
   The additional stresses associated with the spaceflight experiment
   altered the response to microgravity. Despite controlling for the
   effects of these stresses/constraints, the group found that responses to
   microgravity are much stronger in the stressed/constrained background
   than in its absence. This interaction of gravity with other
   environmental influences is a novel finding with important implications
   for microgravity research and other situations where multiple stress
   factors are combined.}},

Abstract = {{Quorum sensing is the phenomenon, whereby bacteria use signal molecules
   to communicate with each other. For example, to establish a successful
   infection, pathogenic bacteria become virulent only when they reach a
   certain local concentration in their host. Bassler and others have
   highlighted the surprising observation that quorum sensing seems to
   repress Vibrio cholerae virulence factor expression (e.g. cholera
   toxin), in contrast to what has been observed for virulence gene
   expression in other bacteria. Here, I present a novel insight that may
   clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes.
   Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are
   frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are
   natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae
   up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin
   protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the
   eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against
   chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year,
   V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics
   of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are
   much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V.
   cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to
   their role in chironomids rather than humans. Further research is needed
   to understand the role of cholera toxin in the environmental existence
   of V. cholerae.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed knowledge about the geographical pathways followed by
   propagules from their source to the invading populations-referred to
   here as routes of invasion-provides information about the history of the
   invasion process and the origin and genetic composition of the invading
   populations. The reconstruction of invasion routes is required for
   defining and testing different hypotheses concerning the environmental
   and evolutionary factors responsible for biological invasions. In
   practical terms, it facilitates the design of strategies for controlling
   or preventing invasions. Most of our knowledge about the introduction
   routes of invasive species is derived from historical and observational
   data, which are often sparse, incomplete and, sometimes, misleading. In
   this context, population genetics has proved a useful approach for
   reconstructing routes of introduction, highlighting the complexity and
   the often counterintuitive nature of the true story. This approach has
   proved particularly useful since the recent development of new
   model-based methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation, making it
   possible to make quantitative inferences in the complex evolutionary
   scenarios typically encountered in invasive species. In this review, we
   summarize some of the fundamental aspects of routes of invasion, explain
   why the reconstruction of these routes is useful for addressing both
   practical and theoretical questions, and comment on the various
   reconstruction methods available. Finally, we consider the main insights
   obtained to date from studies of invasion routes.}},

Abstract = {{The link between adaptive genetic variation, individual fitness and
   wildlife population dynamics is fundamental to the study of ecology and
   evolutionary biology. In this study, a Bayesian modelling approach was
   employed to examine whether individual variability at two major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II loci (DQA and DRB) and eight
   neutral microsatellite loci explained variation in female reproductive
   success for wild populations of European brown hare (Lepus europaeus).
   We examined two aspects of reproduction: the ability to reproduce
   (sterility) and the number of offspring produced (fecundity). Samples
   were collected from eastern Austria, experiencing a sub-continental
   climatic regime, and from Belgium with a more Atlantic-influenced
   climate. As expected, reproductive success (both sterility and
   fecundity) was significantly influenced by age regardless of sampling
   locality. For Belgium, there was also a significant effect of DQA
   heterozygosity in determining whether females were able to reproduce
   (95\% highest posterior density interval of the regression parameter
   {[}-3.64, -0.52]), but no corresponding effect was found for Austria. In
   neither region was reproduction significantly associated with
   heterozygosity at the DRB locus. DQA heterozygotes from both regions
   also showed a clear tendency, but not significantly so, to produce a
   larger number of offspring. Predictive simulations showed that, in
   Belgium, sub-populations of homozygotes will have higher rates of
   sterile individuals and lower average offspring numbers than
   heterozygotes. No similar effect is predicted for Austria. The mechanism
   for the spatial MHC effect is likely to be connected to mate choice for
   increased heterozygosity or to the linkage of certain MHC alleles with
   lethal recessives at other loci.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed nucleotide diversity at two candidate genes LeNCED1 and
   pLC30-15, involved in an ABA (abscisic acid) signalling pathway, in two
   closely related tomato species Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense.
   Our six population samples (three for each species) cover a range of
   mesic to very dry habitats. The ABA pathway plays an important role in
   the plants' response to drought stress. LeNCED1 is an upstream gene
   involved in ABA biosynthesis, and pLC30-15 is a dehydrin gene positioned
   downstream in the pathway. The two genes show very different patterns of
   nucleotide variation. LeNCED1 exhibits very low nucleotide diversity
   relative to the eight neutral reference loci that were previously
   surveyed in these populations. This suggests that strong purifying
   selection has been acting on this gene. In contrast, pLC30-15 exhibits
   higher levels of nucleotide diversity and, in particular in S. chilense,
   higher genetic differentiation between populations than the reference
   loci, which is indicative of local adaptation. In the more
   drought-tolerant species S. chilense, one population (from Quicacha)
   shows a significant haplotype structure, which appears to be the result
   of positive (diversifying) selection.}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a fundamental
   role in the vertebrate immune response and are amongst the most
   polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. It is generally agreed that the
   highly polymorphic nature of the MHC is maintained through host-parasite
   co-evolution. Two nonexclusive mechanisms of selection are supposed to
   act on MHC genes: superiority of MHC heterozygous individuals
   (overdominance) and an advantage for rare MHC alleles. However, the
   precise mechanisms and their relative importance are still unknown.
   Here, we examined MHC dependent parasite load in European rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from a distinct population with low MHC
   diversity (three alleles, six genotypes). Using a multivariate approach,
   we tested for associations of individual MHC class II DRB constitution
   and the rabbits' intestinal burden with nematodes and coccidia. Rabbits
   having a particular allele showed lower infestations with hepatic
   coccidia (E. stiedai). However, a comparison of all six genotypes in the
   population revealed that carriers of this allele only benefit when they
   are heterozygous, and furthermore, MHC heterozygosity in general did not
   affect individual parasite load. In conclusion, this study suggests an
   immunogenetic basis of European rabbit resistance to hepatic
   coccidiosis, which can strongly limit survival to maturity in this
   species. Our study gives a complex picture of MHC-parasite correlations,
   unveiling the limits of the classical hypotheses of how MHC polymorphism
   is maintained in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization is common among cyclical parthenogens, especially in
   zooplankton species assemblages of the genus Daphnia. To explore
   hybridization dynamics and the extent of clonal diversity in the Daphnia
   longispina complex, we analysed population structure in eight permanent
   lakes. Based on 15 microsatellite loci, three major taxonomic units
   emerged: two species, D. galeata and D. longispina and their F1 hybrids,
   supported by factorial correspondence analysis and two Bayesian methods.
   At the same time, the detection of backcross classes differed between
   methods. Mean clonal diversity was lowest in the F1 hybrids, as expected
   from the high rate of asexual reproduction. Within taxa, replicated
   genotypes were of clonal origin, but clonal lineages persisted in
   subsequent years in only one of three resampled lakes. In another lake,
   the taxon composition changed from being dominated by hybrids to
   complete dominance by one parental taxon. Such a year-to-year taxon
   replacement has not been reported for the D. longispina complex before.
   Our data on this hybrid complex illustrate that high-resolution
   genotyping is essential for the understanding of ecological and
   evolutionary outcomes of hybridization in partially clonal taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how spatial genetic patterns respond to landscape change
   is crucial for advancing the emerging field of landscape genetics. We
   quantified the number of generations for new landscape barrier
   signatures to become detectable and for old signatures to disappear
   after barrier removal. We used spatially explicit, individual-based
   simulations to examine the ability of an individual-based statistic
   {[}Mantel's r using the proportion of shared alleles' statistic (Dps)]
   and population-based statistic (F(ST)) to detect barriers. We simulated
   a range of movement strategies including nearest neighbour dispersal,
   long-distance dispersal and panmixia. The lag time for the signal of a
   new barrier to become established is short using Mantel's r (1-15
   generations). F(ST) required approximately 200 generations to reach 50\%
   of its equilibrium maximum, although G'(ST) performed much like Mantel's
   r. In strong contrast, F(ST) and Mantel's r perform similarly following
   the removal of a barrier formerly dividing a population. Also, given
   neighbour mating and very short-distance dispersal strategies,
   historical discontinuities from more than 100 generations ago might
   still be detectable with either method. This suggests that historical
   events and landscapes could have long-term effects that confound
   inferences about the impacts of current landscape features on gene flow
   for species with very little long-distance dispersal. Nonetheless,
   populations of organisms with relatively large dispersal distances will
   lose the signal of a former barrier within less than 15 generations,
   suggesting that individual-based landscape genetic approaches can
   improve our ability to measure effects of existing landscape features on
   genetic structure and connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{An important question for the conservation of species dwelling in
   fragmented habitats is whether changes to the intervening landscape
   create a barrier to gene flow. Here, we make use of the spatial
   distribution of the granite outcrop-dwelling lizard, Ctenophorus
   ornatus, to compare inferred levels of gene flow between outcrops in a
   nature reserve with that between outcrops in the adjacent agricultural
   land. Genetic variation, relatedness and subdivision were compared
   within groups of individuals from different outcrops similar in size and
   distance apart at each site. In the agricultural land, we found
   significantly lower genetic variation within outcrops and greater
   genetic differentiation between outcrops than in the reserve. Further,
   the rate at which genetic divergence between outcrops increased over
   geographical distance was significantly greater in the agricultural land
   than in the reserve. We also found that individuals were more closely
   related within outcrops but more distantly related between outcrops in
   the cleared land. These effects occur over a small spatial scale with an
   average distance between outcrops of less than five kilometres. Thus,
   even though land clearing around the outcrops leaves outcrop size
   unchanged, it restricts gene flow, reducing genetic variation and
   increasing population structure, with potentially negative consequences
   for the long-term persistence of the lizards on these outcrops.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying microevolutionary processes acting in populations of marine
   species with larval dispersal is a challenging but crucial task because
   of its conservation implications. In this context, recent improvements
   in the study of spatial genetic structure (SGS) are particularly
   promising because they allow accurate insights into the demographic and
   evolutionary processes at stake. Using an exhaustive sampling and a
   combination of image processing and population genetics, we highlighted
   significant SGS between colonies of Corallium rubrum over an area of
   half a square metre, which sheds light on a number of aspects of its
   population biology. Based on this SGS, we found the mean dispersal range
   within sites to be between 22.6 and 32.1 cm, suggesting that the
   surveyed area approximately corresponded to a breeding unit. We then
   conducted a kinship analysis, which revealed a complex half-sib family
   structure and allowed us to quantify the level of self-recruitment and
   to characterize aspects of the mating system of this species.
   Furthermore, significant temporal variations in allele frequencies were
   observed, suggesting low genetic drift. These results have important
   conservation implications for the red coral and further our
   understanding of the microevolutionary processes acting within
   populations of sessile marine species with a larval phase.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary potential of plant species that reproduce via
   predominantly clonal means and the conditions under which clonality is
   favoured are not well known. Long-term clonal reproduction is expected
   to result in a number of readily detectable genetic signals not present
   in populations that reproduce by sexual means. We use a hierarchical
   sampling strategy to assess genotype probabilities and confirm that two
   rare sister taxa of Banksia ionthocarpa have contrasting modes of
   reproduction. Banksia ionthocarpa subsp. chrysophoenix reproduces
   clonally. Populations had low levels of genotypic diversity and were
   comprised of large clonal patches consisting of many ramets that covered
   hundreds of square metres and showed little intermixing. The taxon was
   genetically depauperate (mean N-a = 1.97, mean P = 0.66, mean H-e =
   0.282), had high levels of genetic differentiation between populations
   (theta = 0.481), and populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and
   linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci, suggesting historically high
   levels of clonality. In contrast, the sister taxon B. ionthocarpa subsp.
   ionthocarpa, which occurs in an area with more than twice the annual
   rainfall and less extreme minimum and maximum temperatures, showed no
   evidence of clonality, high levels of genotypic diversity, greater
   genetic diversity (mean N-a = 3.31, mean P = 0.81, mean H-e = 0.405),
   lower levels of genetic differentiation between populations (theta =
   0.253) and no evidence of excess heterozygosity or LD among loci. We
   suggest that the development of clonality in subsp. chrysophoenix is
   associated with its more marginal environment and enhanced by response
   to recurrent fires.}},

   patterns of differentiation and isolation-by-distance estimates,

Abstract = {{We investigated genetic diversity and structure of urban white-footed
   mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, populations in New York City (NYC) using
   variation at 18 microsatellite loci. White-footed mice are `urban
   adapters' that occur at higher population densities as habitat fragments
   are reduced in area but have a limited ability to disperse through
   urbanized areas. We hypothesized that this combination of traits has
   produced substantial genetic structure but minimal loss of genetic
   variation over the last century in NYC. Allelic diversity and
   heterozygosity in 14 NYC populations were high, and nearly all of our
   NYC study sites contained genetically distinct populations of
   white-footed mice as measured by pairwise F(ST), assignment tests, and
   Bayesian clustering analyses performed by Structure and baps. Analysis
   of molecular variance revealed that genetic differences between
   populations separated by a few kilometres are more significant than
   differences between prehistorically isolated landmasses (i.e. Bronx,
   Queens, and Manhattan). Allele size permutation tests and lack of
   isolation by distance indicated that mutation and migration are less
   important than drift as explanations for structure in urban, fragmented
   P. leucopus populations. Peromyscus often exhibit little genetic
   structure over even regional scales, prompting us to conclude that
   urbanization is a particularly potent driver of genetic differentiation
   compared to natural fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels
   during Drosophila metamorphosis in the International Space Station (ISS)
   causes important alterations in gene expression: a large set of
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are observed compared to 1g
   controls. However, the preparation procedures for spaceflight and the
   nonideal environmental conditions on board the ISS subject the organisms
   to additional environmental stresses that demonstrably affect gene
   expression. Simulated microgravity experiments performed on the ground,
   under ideal conditions for the flies, using the random position machine
   (RPM), show much more subtle effects on gene expression. However, when
   the ground experiments are repeated under conditions designed to
   reproduce the additional environmental stresses imposed by spaceflight
   procedures, 79\% of the DEGs detected in the ISS are reproduced by the
   RPM experiment. Gene ontology analysis of them shows they are genes that
   affect respiratory activity, developmental processes and stress-related
   changes. Here, we analyse the effects of microgravity on gene expression
   in relation to the environmental stresses imposed by spaceflight.
   Analysis using `gene expression dynamics inspector' (GEDI)
   self-organizing maps reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome to
   microgravity. Remarkably, hypergravity simulation induces similar
   response of the transcriptome, but in the opposite direction, i.e. the
   genes promoted under microgravity are usually suppressed under
   hypergravity. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely
   tuned to normal gravity and that microgravity, together with
   environmental constraints associated with space experiments, can have
   profound effects on gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones have yielded considerable insight into many evolutionary
   processes, including speciation and the maintenance of species
   boundaries. Presented here are analyses from a hybrid zone that occurs
   among three salamanders -Plethodon jordani, Plethodon metcalfi and
   Plethodon teyahalee- from the southern Appalachian Mountains. Using a
   novel statistical approach for analysis of non-clinal, multispecies
   hybrid zones, we examined spatial patterns of variation at four markers:
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the mtDNA ND2 gene and
   the nuclear DNA ILF3 gene, and the morphological markers of red cheek
   pigmentation and white flecks. Concordance of the ILF3 marker and both
   morphological markers across four transects is observed. In three of the
   four transects, however, the pattern of mtDNA is discordant from all
   other markers, with a higher representation of P. metcalfi mtDNA in the
   northern and lower elevation localities than is expected given the ILF3
   marker and morphology. To explore whether climate plays a role in the
   position of the hybrid zone, we created ecological niche models for P.
   jordani and P. metcalfi. Modelling results suggest that hybrid zone
   position is not determined by steep gradients in climatic suitability
   for either species. Instead, the hybrid zone lies in a climatically
   homogenous region that is broadly suitable for both P. jordani and P.
   metcalfi. We discuss various selective (natural selection associated
   with climate) and behavioural processes (sex-biased dispersal,
   asymmetric reproductive isolation) that might explain the discordance in
   the extent to which mtDNA and nuclear DNA and colour-pattern traits have
   moved across this hybrid zone.}},

Abstract = {{Attempts by biogeographers to understand biotic diversification in the
   Amazon have often employed contemporary species distribution patterns to
   support particular theories, such as Pleistocene rainforest refugia,
   rather than to test among alternative hypotheses. Suture zones, narrow
   regions where multiple contact zones and hybrid zones between taxa
   cluster, have been seen as evidence for past expansion of whole biotas
   that have undergone allopatric divergence in vicariant refuges. We used
   coalescent analysis of mutilocus sequence data to examine population
   split times in 22 pairs of geminate taxa in ithomiine and heliconiine
   butterflies. We test a hypothesis of simultaneous divergence across a
   suture zone in NE Peru. Our results reveal a scattered time course of
   diversification in this suture zone, rather than a tight cluster of
   split times. Additionally, we find rapid diversification within some
   lineages such as Melinaea contrasting with older divergence within
   lineages such as the Oleriina (Hyposcada and Oleria). These results
   strongly reject simple vicariance as a cause of the suture zone. At the
   same time, observed lineage effects are incompatible with a series of
   geographically coincident vicariant events which should affect all
   lineages similarly. Our results suggest that Pleistocene climatic
   forcing cannot readily explain this Peruvian suture zone.
   Lineage-specific biological traits, such as characteristic distances of
   gene flow or varying rates of parapatric divergence, may be of greater
   importance.}},

Abstract = {{The general phylogeographical paradigm for eastern North America (ENA)
   is that many plant and animal species retreated into southern refugia
   during the last glacial period, then expanded northward after the last
   glacial maximum (LGM). However, some taxa of the Gulf and Atlantic
   Coastal Plain (GACP) demonstrate complex yet recurrent distributional
   patterns that cannot be explained by this model. For example, eight
   co-occurring endemic plant taxa with ranges from New York to South
   Carolina exhibit a large disjunction separating northern and southern
   populations by > 300 km. Pyxidanthera (Diapensiaceae), a plant genus
   that exhibits this pattern, consists of two taxa recognized as either
   species or varieties. We investigated the taxonomy and phylogeography of
   Pyxidanthera using morphological data, cpDNA sequences, and amplified
   fragment length polymorphism markers. Morphological characters thought
   to be important in distinguishing Pyxidanthera barbulata and P.
   brevifolia demonstrate substantial overlap with no clear
   discontinuities. Genetic differentiation is minimal and diversity
   estimates for northern and southern populations of Pxyidanthera are
   similar, with no decrease in rare alleles in northern populations. In
   addition, the northern populations harbour several unique cpDNA
   haplotypes. Pyxidanthera appears to consist of one morphologically
   variable species that persisted in or near its present range at least
   through the latter Pleistocene, while the vicariance of the northern and
   southern populations may be comparatively recent. This work demonstrates
   that the refugial paradigm is not always appropriate and GACP endemic
   plants, in particular, may exhibit phylogeographical patterns
   qualitatively different from those of other ENA plant species.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which the distribution of soil bacteria is controlled by
   local environment vs. spatial factors (e.g. dispersal, colonization
   limitation, evolutionary events) is poorly understood and widely
   debated. Our understanding of biogeographic controls in microbial
   communities is likely hampered by the enormous environmental variability
   encountered across spatial scales and the broad diversity of microbial
   life histories. Here, we constrained environmental factors (soil
   chemistry, climate, above-ground plant community) to investigate the
   specific influence of space, by fitting all other variables first, on
   bacterial communities in soils over distances from m to 102 km. We found
   strong evidence for a spatial component to bacterial community structure
   that varies with scale and organism life history (dispersal and survival
   ability). Geographic distance had no influence over community structure
   for organisms known to have survival stages, but the converse was true
   for organisms thought to be less hardy. Community function (substrate
   utilization) was also shown to be highly correlated with community
   structure, but not to abiotic factors, suggesting nonstochastic
   determinants of community structure are important Our results support
   the view that bacterial soil communities are constrained by both edaphic
   factors and geographic distance and further show that the relative
   importance of such constraints depends critically on the taxonomic
   resolution used to evaluate spatio-temporal patterns of microbial
   diversity, as well as life history of the groups being investigated,
   much as is the case for macro-organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The global distribution, abundance, and diversity of microscopic
   freshwater algae demonstrate an ability to overcome significant barriers
   such as dry land and oceans by exploiting a range of biotic and abiotic
   colonization vectors. If these vectors are considered unlimited and
   colonization occurs in proportion to population size, then globally
   ubiquitous distributions are predicted to arise. This model contrasts
   with observations that many freshwater microalgal taxa possess true
   biogeographies. Here, using a concatenated multigene data set, we study
   the phylogeography of the freshwater heterokont alga Synura petersenii
   sensu lato. Our results suggest that this Synura morphotaxon contains
   both cosmopolitan and regionally endemic cryptic species, co-occurring
   in some cases, and masked by a common ultrastructural morphology.
   Phylogenies based on both proteins (seven protein-coding plastid and
   mitochondrial genes) and DNA (nine genes including ITS and 18S rDNA)
   reveal pronounced biogeographic delineations within phylotypes of this
   cryptic species complex while retaining one clade that is globally
   distributed. Relaxed molecular clock calculations, constrained by fossil
   records, suggest that the genus Synura is considerably older than
   currently proposed. The availability of tectonically relevant geological
   time (107-108 years) has enabled the development of the observed,
   complex biogeographic patterns. Our comprehensive analysis of freshwater
   algal biogeography suggests that neither ubiquity nor endemism wholly
   explains global patterns of microbial eukaryote distribution and that
   processes of dispersal remain poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene ice-ages greatly influenced the historical abundances of
   Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, in the North Pacific and its marginal
   seas. We surveyed genetic variation at 11 microsatellite loci and
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA in samples from twelve locations from the Sea of
   Japan to Washington State. Both microsatellite (mean H = 0.868) and
   mtDNA haplotype (mean h = 0.958) diversities were large and did not show
   any geographical trends. Genetic differentiation between samples was
   significantly correlated with geographical distance between samples for
   both microsatellites (F(ST) = 0.028, r2 = 0.33) and mtDNA (F(ST) =
   0.027, r2 = 0.18). Both marker classes showed a strong genetic
   discontinuity between northwestern and northeastern Pacific populations
   that likely represents groups previously isolated during glaciations
   that are now in secondary contact. Significant differences appeared
   between samples from the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea that may reflect
   ice-age isolations in the northwest Pacific. In the northeast Pacific, a
   microsatellite and mtDNA partition was detected between coastal and
   Georgia Basin populations. The presence of two major coastal mtDNA
   lineages on either side of the Pacific Ocean basin implies at least two
   ice-age refugia and separate postglacial population expansions
   facilitated by different glacial histories. Northward expansions into
   the Gulf of Alaska were possible 14-15 kyr ago, but deglaciation and
   colonization of the Georgia Basin probably occurred somewhat later.
   Population expansions were evident in mtDNA mismatch distributions and
   in Bayesian skyline plots of the three major lineages, but the start of
   expansions appeared to pre-date the last glacial maximum.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive, accurate paternity assignment is critical to answering
   numerous questions in evolutionary ecology. Yet, most studies of species
   with extra-pair paternity (EPP) fail to assign sires to all offspring.
   Common limitations include incomplete and biased sampling of offspring
   and males, particularly with respect to male location and social status,
   potentially biasing estimated patterns of paternity. Studies that
   achieve comprehensive sampling and paternity assignment are therefore
   required. Accordingly, we genotyped virtually all males and > 99\% of
   6-day-old offspring over 16 years in a song sparrow (Melospiza melodia)
   population and used three complementary statistical methodologies to
   attempt complete paternity assignment for all 2207 offspring.
   Assignments were highly consistent across maximum likelihood methods
   that used solely genotype data, and heuristic and integrated Bayesian
   analyses that included data describing individual locations. Sires were
   assigned to > 99\% of all genotyped offspring with >= 95\% confidence,
   revealing an EPP rate of c. 28\%. Extra-pair sires primarily occupied
   territories neighbouring their extra-pair offspring; spatial location
   was therefore highly informative for paternity assignment. EPP was
   biased towards paired territorial males, although unpaired territorial
   and floater males sired c. 13\% of extra-pair offspring. Failing to
   sample and include unpaired males as candidate sires would therefore
   substantially reduce assignment rates. These analyses demonstrate the
   integration of genetic and ecological information to achieve
   comprehensive paternity assignment and direct biological insight,
   illustrate the potential biases that common forms of incomplete sampling
   could have on estimated patterns of EPP, and provide an essential basis
   for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of EPP.}},

Abstract = {{Bemisia tabaci, an invasive pest that causes crop damage worldwide, is a
   highly differentiated species complex, divided into biotypes that have
   mainly been defined based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. Although
   endosymbionts can potentially induce population differentiation,
   specialization and indirect selection on mtDNA, studies have largely
   ignored these influential passengers in B. tabaci, despite as many as
   seven bacterial endosymbionts have been identified. Here, we investigate
   the composition of the whole bacterial community in worldwide
   populations of B. tabaci, together with host genetic differentiation,
   focusing on the invasive B and Q biotypes. Among 653 individuals
   studied, more than 95\% of them harbour at least one secondary
   endosymbiont, and multiple infections are very common. In addition,
   sequence analyses reveal a very high diversity of facultative
   endosymbionts in B. tabaci, with some bacterial genus being represented
   by more than one strain. In the B and Q biotypes, nine different strains
   of bacteria have been identified. The mtDNA-based phylogeny of B. tabaci
   also reveals a very high nucleotide diversity that partitions the two
   ITS clades (B and Q) into six CO1 genetic groups. Each genetic group is
   in linkage disequilibrium with a specific combination of endosymbionts.
   All together, our results demonstrate the rapid dynamics of the
   bacterial endosymbiont-host associations at a small evolutionary scale,
   questioning the role of endosymbiotic communities in the evolution of
   the Bemisia tabaci species complex and strengthening the need to develop
   a metacommunity theory of inherited endosymbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Montgomery Slatkin, in a classic article concerning the role of gene
   flow in determining population genetic structure in natural populations
   noted an inconsistency between observations made in the field of limited
   dispersal of weakly flying insect and population genetic analyses of
   genetic structure which revealed extensive gene flow among populations.
   This phenomenon was subsequently termed Slatkin's Paradox. In this
   issue, Yu et al. (2010) provide an example of Slatkin's Paradox in a
   study of seed and pollen gene flow in the dioecious understory fig Ficus
   hirta in southern Asia. Given multiple field observations that showed
   the low vagility of fig wasp pollinators of dioecious figs and the high
   movement capacity of its vertebrate seed dispersers, the authors
   expected to see higher levels of gene movement of seed versus pollen.
   They compared neutral genetic differentiation across 15 populations
   separated by > 2500 km at six nuclear microsatellite and two chloroplast
   loci and found that F. hirta shows an order of magnitude higher level of
   gene flow of pollen relative to seeds that challenges observations of
   limited dispersal of fig wasps that pollinate dioecious figs. They
   propose broadening the application of Slatkin's Paradox beyond insects
   to include situations where an incongruity exists between ecological
   measures of low dispersal and high levels of effective gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Probably no conservation genetics issue is currently more controversial
   than the question of whether grey wolves (Canis lupus) in the Northern
   Rockies have recovered to genetically effective levels. Following the
   dispersal-based recolonization of Northwestern Montana from Canada, and
   reintroductions to Yellowstone and Central Idaho, wolves have vastly
   exceeded population recovery goals of 300 wolves distributed in at least
   10 breeding pairs in each of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. With > 1700
   wolves currently, efforts to delist wolves from endangered status have
   become mired in legal battles over the distinct population segment (DPS)
   clause of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and whether subpopulations
   within the DPS were genetically isolated. An earlier study by vonHoldt
   et al. (2008) suggested Yellowstone National Park wolves were indeed
   isolated and was used against delisting in 2008. Since then, wolves were
   temporarily delisted, and a first controversial hunting season occurred
   in fall of 2009. Yet, concerns over the genetic recovery of wolves in
   the Northern Rockies remain, and upcoming District court rulings in the
   summer of 2010 will probably include consideration of gene flow between
   subpopulations. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, vonHoldt et al.
   (2010) conduct the largest analysis of gene flow and population
   structure of the Northern Rockies wolves to date. Using an impressive
   sampling design and novel analytic methods, vonHoldt et al. (2010) show
   substantial levels of gene flow between three identified subpopulations
   of wolves within the Northern Rockies, clarifying previous analyses and
   convincingly showing genetic recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies demonstrate that natural hybridization in animals is
   more common than thought so far (Mallet 2005), particularly among
   species that originated recently through cycles of population
   contraction-expansion arising from climate changes over the last glacial
   period, the Pleistocene. In addition, the post-glacial global growth of
   human populations has fostered anthropogenic hybridization events,
   mediated by habitat changes, the persecution of large predators and the
   introduction of alien species (Allendorf et al. 2001). The Canis lineage
   shows cases of both natural and anthropogenic hybridization,
   exacerbating the controversy about the number of species that should be
   formally validated in the taxonomic lists, the evolutionary role of
   genetic introgression and the ways to manage hybrids with invading wild
   or domesticated populations. The study by Wheeldon et al. (2010),
   published in this issue of Molecular Ecology, adds a new piece to the
   intricate puzzle of evolution and taxonomy of Canis in North America.
   They show that sympatric wolves (C. lupus) and coyotes (C. latrans) are
   not (extensively) hybridizing in the western North American Great Lakes
   region (GLR). Widespread hybridization between coyotes and a genetically
   distinct, but closely related, wolf-like population (the eastern wolf)
   occurred in the northeastern regions of North America. In Wheeldon et
   al.'s (2010) opinion, these data should prove definitely that two
   different species of wolf (the western gray wolf C. lupus and the
   eastern wolf C. lycaon) and their hybrids are distributed across the
   GLR.}},

Abstract = {{How and why ecological communities change their species membership over
   time and space is a central issue in ecology and evolution.
   Phylogeographic approaches based on animal mitochondrial DNA sequences
   have been important for revealing historical patterns of individual
   species and can provide qualitative comparisons among species. Exciting
   new methods, particularly implementing approximate Bayesian computation
   (ABC - Beaumont et al. 2002), now allow model-based quantitative
   comparisons among species and permit the probabilistic exploration of
   alternative community-level hypotheses (see review by Hickerson et al.
   2010). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Ilves et al. (2010) use an
   ABC approach to bring fresh insights into the well-studied question of
   how North Atlantic coastal species contracted and expanded their ranges
   in response to late Pleistocene/Holocene climate fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-sea hydrothermal vents provide ephemeral habitats for animal
   communities that depend on chemosynthetic primary production. Sporadic
   volcanic and tectonic events destroy local vent fields and create new
   ones. Ongoing dispersal and cycles of extirpation and colonization
   affect the levels and distribution of genetic diversity in vent
   metapopulations. Several species exhibit evidence for stepping-stone
   dispersal along relatively linear, oceanic, ridge axes. Other species
   exhibit very high rates of gene flow, although natural barriers
   associated with variation in depth, deep-ocean currents, and lateral
   offsets of ridge axes often subdivide populations. Various degrees of
   impedance to dispersal across such boundaries are products of
   species-specific life histories and behaviours. Though unrelated to the
   size of a species range, levels of genetic diversity appear to
   correspond with the number of active vent localities that a species
   occupies within its range. Pioneer species that rapidly colonize nascent
   vents tend to be less subdivided and more diverse genetically than
   species that are slow to establish colonies at vents. Understanding the
   diversity and connectivity of vent metapopulations provides essential
   information for designing deep-sea preserves in regions that are under
   consideration for submarine mining of precious metals.}},

Abstract = {{The successful re-introduction of grey wolves to the western United
   States is an impressive accomplishment for conservation science.
   However, the degree to which subpopulations are genetically structured
   and connected, along with the preservation of genetic variation, is an
   important concern for the continued viability of the metapopulation. We
   analysed DNA samples from 555 Northern Rocky Mountain wolves from the
   three recovery areas (Greater Yellowstone Area, Montana, and Idaho),
   including all 66 re-introduced founders, for variation in 26
   microsatellite loci over the initial 10-year recovery period
   (1995-2004). The population maintained high levels of variation (H-O =
   0.64-0.72; allelic diversity k = 7.0-10.3) with low levels of inbreeding
   (F-IS < 0.03) and throughout this period, the population expanded
   rapidly (n(1995) = 101; n(2004) = 846). Individual-based Bayesian
   analyses revealed significant population genetic structure and
   identified three subpopulations coinciding with designated recovery
   areas. Population assignment and migrant detection were difficult
   because of the presence of related founders among different recovery
   areas and required a novel approach to determine genetically effective
   migration and admixture. However, by combining assignment tests, private
   alleles, sibship reconstruction, and field observations, we detected
   genetically effective dispersal among the three recovery areas.
   Successful conservation of Northern Rocky Mountain wolves will rely on
   management decisions that promote natural dispersal dynamics and
   minimize anthropogenic factors that reduce genetic connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of the genetic composition and taxonomic history of
   wolves in the western Great Lakes region (WGLR) of the United States has
   long been debated and has become more important to their conservation
   given the recent changes in their status under the Endangered Species
   Act. Currently, the two competing hypotheses on WGLR wolves are that
   they resulted from hybridization between (i) grey wolves (Canis lupus)
   and western coyotes (C. latrans) or (ii) between grey wolves and eastern
   wolves (C. lycaon). We performed a genetic analysis of sympatric wolves
   and coyotes from the region to assess the degree of reproductive
   isolation between them and to clarify the taxonomic status of WGLR
   wolves. Based on data from maternal, paternal and bi-parental genetic
   markers, we demonstrate a clear genetic distinction between sympatric
   wolves and coyotes and conclude that they are reproductively isolated
   and that wolf-coyote hybridization in the WGLR is uncommon. The data
   reject the hypothesis that wolves in the WGLR derive from hybridization
   between grey wolves and western coyotes, and we conclude that the extant
   WGLR wolf population is derived from hybridization between grey wolves
   and eastern wolves. Grey-eastern wolf hybrids (C. lupus x lycaon)
   comprise a substantial population that extends across Michigan,
   Wisconsin, Minnesota and western Ontario. These findings have important
   implications for the conservation and management of wolves in North
   America, specifically concerning the overestimation of grey wolf numbers
   in the United States and the need to address policies for hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{In flying insects, there is frequently a lack of congruence between
   empirical estimates of local demographic parameters and the prediction
   that differentiation between populations should decrease with increasing
   dispersal, a puzzling phenomenon known as Slatkin's Paradox. Here, we
   generalize Slatkin's Paradox to other taxa, drawing from available
   information on dispersal to predict the relative importance of pollen
   vs. seed migration in structuring broad-scale patterns of genetic
   variation in Ficus hirta, a dioecious fig whose pollen is dispersed by
   minute, species-specific fig wasps and whose seeds are disseminated by a
   variety of vagile vertebrates (especially bats and birds). Local-scale
   observational and genetic studies of dioecious understory figs suggest
   comparable rates of pollen and seed migration. In contrast, we found
   unusually low nuclear differentiation (F(ST) = 0.037, R(ST) = 0.074) and
   high chloroplast differentiation (G(ST) = 0.729, N(ST) = 0.798) among
   populations separated by up to 2850 km, leading us to reject the
   hypothesis of equal pollen and seed migration rates and to obtain an
   equilibrium estimate of the ratio of pollen to seed migration of r =
   16.2-36.3. We reconcile this example of Slatkin's Paradox with
   previously published data for dioecious figs and relate it to the
   picture of exceptionally long-distance wasp-mediated pollen dispersal
   that is emerging for large monoecious fig trees. More generally, we
   argue that Slatkin's Paradox is a general phenomenon and suggest it may
   be common in plants and animals.}},

Abstract = {{Heterozygosity-fitness correlations use molecular measures of
   heterozygosity as proxy estimates of individual inbreeding coefficients
   (f) to examine relationships between inbreeding and fitness traits.
   Heterozygosity-fitness correlations partly depend on the assumption that
   individual heterozygosity and f are strongly and negatively correlated.
   Although theory predicts that this relationship will be strongest when
   mean f and variance in f are high, few studies of heterozygosity-fitness
   correlations include estimates of f based on pedigrees, which allow for
   more thorough examinations of the relationship between f, heterozygosity
   and fitness in nature. We examined relationships between pedigree-based
   estimates of f, multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) and the probability of
   survival to hatch in song sparrow nestmates. f and MLH were weakly, but
   significantly negatively correlated. Inbreeding coefficient predicted
   the probability of survival to hatch. In contrast, MLH did not predict
   the probability of survival to hatch nor did it account for residual
   variation in survival to hatch after statistically controlling for the
   effects of f. These results are consistent with the expectation that
   heterozygosity-f correlations will be weak when mean and variance in f
   are low. Our results also provide empirical support for recent
   simulation studies, which show that variation in MLH among siblings with
   equal f can be large and may obscure MLH-fitness relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the Pleistocene climate oscillations on the structure of
   biodiversity in tropical regions remains poorly understood. In this
   study, the forest refuge theory is examined at the molecular level in
   Milicia excelsa, a dioecious tree with a continuous range throughout
   tropical Africa. Eight nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and two sequences
   and one microsatellite from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) showed a deep divide
   between samples from Benin and those from Lower Guinea. This suggests
   that these populations were isolated in separate geographical regions,
   probably for several glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, and that the
   nuclear gene pools were not homogenized despite M. excelsa's
   wind-pollination syndrome. The divide could also be related to seed
   dispersal patterns, which should be largely determined by the migration
   behaviour of M. excelsa's main seed disperser, the frugivorous bat
   Eidolon helvum. Within Lower Guinea, a north-south divide, observed with
   both marker types despite weak genetic structure (nSSRs: F-ST = 0.035,
   cpDNA: G(ST) = 0.506), suggested the existence of separate Pleistocene
   refugia in Cameroon and the Gabon/Congo region. We inferred a
   pollen-to-seed dispersal distance ratio of c. 1.8, consistent with
   wide-ranging gene dispersal by both wind and bats. Simulations in an
   Approximate Bayesian Computation framework suggested low nSSR and cpDNA
   mutation rates, but imprecise estimates of other demographic parameters,
   probably due to a substantial gene flow between the Lower Guinean gene
   pools. The decline of genetic diversity detected in some Gabonese
   populations could be a consequence of the relatively recent
   establishment of a closed canopy forest, which could negatively affect
   M. excelsa's reproductive system.}},

Abstract = {{Dormant life stages are important strategies for many aquatic organisms.
   The formation of resting stages will provide a refuge from unfavourable
   conditions in the water column, and their successive accumulation in the
   benthos will constitute a genetic reservoir for future planktonic
   populations. We have determined the genetic structure of a common
   bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema marinoi, in the sediment and the
   plankton during spring, summer and autumn two subsequent years
   (2007-2009) in Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish west coast. Eight
   polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to assess the level of genetic
   differentiation and the respective gene diversity of the two different
   habitats. We also determined the degree of genetic differentiation
   between the seed banks inside the fjord and the open sea. The results
   indicate that Gullmar Fjord has one dominant endogenous population of S.
   marinoi, which is genetically differentiated from the open sea
   population. The fjord population is encountered in the plankton and in
   the sediment. Shifts from the dominant population can happen, and in our
   study, two genetically differentiated plankton populations, displaying
   reduced genetic diversity, occurred in September 2007 and 2008. Based on
   our results, we suggest that sill fjords maintain local long-lived and
   well-adapted protist populations, which continuously shift between the
   planktonic and benthic habitats. Intermittently, short-lived and mainly
   asexually reproducing populations can replace the dominant population in
   the water column, without influencing the genetic structure of the
   benthic seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of the fine-scale population dynamics of the mosquito
   Aedes taeniorhynchus is needed to improve our understanding of its role
   as a disease vector in the Galapagos Islands. We used microsatellite
   data to assess the genetic structure of coastal and highland mosquito
   populations and patterns of gene flow between the two habitats through
   time on Santa Cruz Island. In addition, we assessed possible
   associations of mosquito abundance and genetic diversity with
   environmental variables. The coastal and highland mosquito populations
   were highly differentiated from each other all year round, with some
   gene flow detected only during periods of increased precipitation. The
   results support the hypothesis that selection arising from ecological
   differences between habitats is driving adaptation and divergence in A.
   taeniorhynchus, and maintaining long-term genetic differentiation of the
   populations against gene flow. The highland and lowland populations may
   constitute an example of incipient speciation in progress. Highland
   populations were characterized by lower observed heterozygosity and
   allelic richness, suggesting a founder effect and/or lower breeding site
   availability in the highlands. A lack of reduction in genetic diversity
   over time in highland populations suggests that they survive dry periods
   as dormant eggs. Association between mosquito abundance and
   precipitation was strong in the highlands, whereas tide height was the
   main factor affecting mosquito abundance on the coast. Our findings
   suggests differences in the infection dynamics of mosquito-borne
   parasites in the highlands compared to the coast, and a higher risk of
   mosquito-driven disease spread across these habitats during periods of
   increased precipitation.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal and subtidal communities of the western and eastern coasts of
   the North Atlantic Ocean were greatly affected by Pleistocene
   glaciations, with some taxa persisting on both coasts, and others
   recolonizing after being extirpated on one coast during the Last Glacial
   Maximum. In the original spirit of comparative phylogeography, we
   conducted a comparative analysis using mtDNA sequence data and a
   hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for testing
   these two scenarios across 12 intertidal and subtidal coastal
   invertebrates spanning the North Atlantic to determine the temporal
   dynamics of species membership of these two ephemeral communities.
   Conditioning on a low gene-flow model, our results suggested that a
   colonization or mitochondrial selective sweep history was predominant
   across all taxa, with only the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis showing a
   history of trans-Atlantic persistence. Conditioning on a high gene-flow
   model weakened the support for this assemblage-level demographic
   history. The predominance of a colonization-type history also highlights
   concerns about analyses based on single-locus data where genetic
   hitchhiking may be incorrectly inferred as colonization. In conclusion,
   driving factors in shifting species range distributions and membership
   of ephemeral coastal communities could be species-specific environmental
   tolerances, species interactions, and/or stochastic demographic
   extinction. Through a re-examination of a long-standing question of
   North Atlantic phylogeography, we highlight the flexibility and
   statistical honesty of using a model-based ABC approach.}},

Abstract = {{Historical isolation during Pleistocene low sea level periods is thought
   to have contributed to divergence among marine basin populations across
   the Coral Triangle. In the Philippine archipelago, populations in the
   South China Sea, Sulu Sea-inland seas, and Philippine Sea-Celebes Sea
   basins might have been partially isolated. Meanwhile, present-day
   broadscale oceanographic circulation patterns suggest connectivity
   between these basins. To evaluate hypotheses regarding the influence of
   historical and contemporary factors on genetic structure,
   phylogeographic patterns based on mitochondrial control region sequences
   for a reef-associated fish, Siganus fuscescens, were analysed. Three
   distinct lineages were recovered. One lineage was identified as the
   morphologically similar species Siganus canaliculatus, while two
   lineages are monophyletic with S. fuscescens. Clade divergence and
   demographic expansion in S. fuscescens occurred during the Pleistocene.
   A strong signal of latitudinal structure was detected (Theta(CT) =
   0.188), driven by marked differences in clade distribution: one clade is
   widely distributed (clade A), while a second clade (clade B) has a
   restricted northern distribution. Regional structure of clade A is
   consistent with the basin isolation hypothesis (Theta(CT) = 0.040) and
   suggests isolation of the South China Sea (Theta(CT) = 0.091).
   Fine-scale structure was observed in the South China Sea and south
   Philippine Sea, while Sulu Sea and inland seas were unstructured.
   Genetic structure across multiple spatial scales (archipelagic,
   regional, and fine-scale within basins) suggests the influence of
   vicariant barriers and contemporary limits to gene flow in S. fuscescens
   that may be influenced by oceanographic circulation, geographical
   distance between available habitats, and latitudinal temperature
   differences.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4535-4553}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing consensus that much of the contemporary
   phylogeography of northern hemisphere coastal taxa reflects the impact
   of Pleistocene glaciation, when glaciers covered much of the coastline
   at higher latitudes and sea levels dropped by as much as 150 m. The
   genetic signature of postglacial recolonization has been detected in
   many marine species, but the effects of coastal glaciation are not
   ubiquitous, leading to suggestions that species may intrinsically differ
   in their ability to respond to the environmental change associated with
   glacial cycles. Such variation may indeed have a biological basis, but
   apparent differences in population structure among taxa may also stem
   from our heavy reliance on individual mitochondrial loci, which are
   strongly influenced by stochasticity during coalescence. We investigated
   the contemporary population genetics of Syngnathus typhle, one of the
   most widespread European coastal fish species, using a multilocus data
   set to investigate the influence of Pleistocene glaciation and reduced
   sea levels on its phylogeography. A strong signal of postglacial
   recolonization was detected at both the northern and eastern ends of the
   species' distribution, while southern populations appear to have been
   relatively unaffected by the last glacial cycle. Patterns of population
   variation and differentiation at nuclear and mitochondrial loci differ
   significantly, but simulations indicate that these differences can be
   explained by the stochastic nature of the coalescent process. These
   results demonstrate the strength of a multilocus approach to
   phylogeography and suggest that an overdependence on mitochondrial loci
   may provide a misleading picture of population-level processes.}},

Abstract = {{Peripatric speciation and the importance of founder effects have long
   been controversial, and multilocus sequence data and coalescent methods
   now allow hypotheses of peripatric speciation to be tested in a rigorous
   manner. Using a multilocus phylogeographical data set for two species of
   salamanders (genus Hydromantes) from the Sierra Nevada of California,
   hypotheses of recent divergence by peripatric speciation and older,
   allopatric divergence were tested. Phylogeographical analysis revealed
   two divergent lineages within Hydromantes platycephalus, which were
   estimated to have diverged in the Pliocene. By contrast, a low-elevation
   species, Hydromantes brunus, diverged from within the northern lineage
   of H. platycephalus much more recently (mid-Pleistocene), during a time
   of major climatic change in the Sierra Nevada. Multilocus species tree
   estimation and coalescent estimates of divergence time, migration rate,
   and growth rate reject a scenario of ancient speciation of H. brunus
   with subsequent gene flow and introgression from H. platycephalus,
   instead supporting a more recent divergence with population expansion.
   Although the small, peripheral distribution of H. brunus suggests the
   possibility of peripatric speciation, the estimated founding population
   size of the species was too large to have allowed founder effects to be

   recent speciation, most likely tied to the climatic changes of the

   adults in coastal New Zealand: testing an oceanographic hypothesis}},

Abstract = {{Coastal populations are often connected by unidirectional current
   systems, but the biological effects of such asymmetric oceanographic
   connectivity remain relatively unstudied. We used mtDNA analysis to
   determine the phylogeographic origins of beach-cast bull-kelp
   (Durvillaea antarctica) adults in the Canterbury Bight, a 180 km coastal
   region devoid of rocky-reef habitat in southern New Zealand. A
   multi-year, quantitative analysis supports the oceanographically derived
   hypothesis of asymmetric dispersal mediated by the north-flowing
   Southland Current. Specifically, 92\% of beach-cast specimens examined
   had originated south of the Bight, many drifting north for hundreds of
   kilometres, and some traversing at least 500 km of ocean from
   subantarctic sources. In contrast, only 8\% of specimens had dispersed
   south against the prevailing current, and these counter-current
   dispersers likely travelled relatively small distances (tens of
   kilometres). These data show that oceanographic connectivity models can
   provide robust estimates of passive biological dispersal, even for
   highly buoyant taxa. The results also indicate that there are no
   oceanographic barriers to kelp dispersal across the Canterbury Bight,
   indicating that other ecological factors explain the phylogeographic
   disjunction across this kelp-free zone. The large number of
   long-distance dispersal events detected suggests drifting macroalgae
   have potential to facilitate ongoing connectivity between otherwise
   isolated benthic populations.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics has seen rapid growth in number of publications since
   the term was coined in 2003. An extensive literature search from 1998 to
   2008 using keywords associated with landscape genetics yielded 655
   articles encompassing a vast array of study organisms, study designs and
   methodology. These publications were screened to identify 174 studies
   that explicitly incorporated at least one landscape variable with
   genetic data. We systematically reviewed this set of papers to assess
   taxonomic and temporal trends in: (i) geographic regions studied; (ii)
   types of questions addressed; (iii) molecular markers used; (iv)
   statistical analyses used; and (v) types and nature of spatial data
   used. Overall, studies have occurred in geographic regions proximal to
   developed countries and more commonly in terrestrial vs. aquatic
   habitats. Questions most often focused on effects of barriers and/or
   landscape variables on gene flow. The most commonly used molecular
   markers were microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (AFLPs), with AFLPs used more frequently in plants than animals.
   Analysis methods were dominated by Mantel and assignment tests. We also
   assessed differences among journals to evaluate the uniformity of
   reporting and publication standards. Few studies presented an explicit
   study design or explicit descriptions of spatial extent. While some
   landscape variables such as topographic relief affected most species
   studied, effects were not universal, and some species appeared
   unaffected by the landscape. Effects of habitat fragmentation were
   mixed, with some species altering movement paths and others unaffected.
   Taken together, although some generalities emerged regarding effects of
   specific landscape variables, results varied, thereby reinforcing the
   need for species-specific work. We conclude by: highlighting gaps in
   knowledge and methodology, providing guidelines to authors and reviewers
   of landscape genetics studies, and suggesting promising future
   directions of inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded
   in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that
   infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape
   genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological
   processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the
   linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the
   geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and
   parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts
   and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to
   insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and
   control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four
   different motivations for the application of landscape genetics
   approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation
   in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host
   population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological
   dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example,
   gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the
   concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the
   temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing
   and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review,
   we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection
   dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global
   geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional
   `landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the
   spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some
   general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological
   processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future
   directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial analytical methods have been used by biologists for decades, but
   with new modelling approaches and data availability their application is
   accelerating. While early approaches were purely spatial in nature, it
   is now possible to explore the underlying causes of spatial
   heterogeneity of biological variation using a wealth of environmental
   data, especially from satellite remote sensing. Recent methods can not
   only make inferences regarding spatial relationships and the causes of
   spatial heterogeneity, but also create predictive maps of patterns of
   biological variation under changing environmental conditions. Here, we
   review the methods involved in making continuous spatial predictions
   from biological variation using spatial and environmental predictor
   variables, provide examples of their use and critically evaluate the
   advantages and limitations. In the final section, we discuss some of the
   key challenges and opportunities for future work.}},

Abstract = {{Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in
   which spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored.
   In contrast, the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how
   population genetic processes are affected by complex spatial and
   temporal environmental heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and
   relates patterns to processes by combining complex and realistic life
   histories, behaviours, landscape features and genetic data. Central to
   landscape genetics is the connection of spatial patterns of genetic
   variation to the usually highly stochastic space-time processes that
   create them over both historical and contemporary time periods. The
   field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation approaches,
   which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental
   stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic
   processes such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape
   features to affect probability of site occupancy, population size, and
   gene flow, which in turn determine spatial genetic structure.
   Simulations could also be used to compare various statistical methods
   and determine which have correct type I error or the highest statistical
   power to correctly identify spatio-temporal and environmental effects.
   Simulations may also help in evaluating how specific spatial metrics may
   be used to project future genetic trends. This article summarizes some
   of the fundamental aspects of spatial-temporal population genetic
   processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations to determine
   how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to identify
   features of interest, including contrasting locus-specific spatial
   patterns due to micro-scale environmental selection.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape features exist at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and
   these naturally affect spatial genetic structure and our ability to make
   inferences about gene flow. This article discusses how decisions about
   sampling of genotypes (including choices about analytical methods and
   genetic markers) should be driven by the scale of spatial genetic
   structure, the time frame that landscape features have existed in their
   current state, and all aspects of a species' life history. Researchers
   should use caution when making inferences about gene flow, especially
   when the spatial extent of the study area is limited. The scale of
   sampling of the landscape introduces different features that may affect
   gene flow. Sampling grain should be smaller than the average home-range
   size or dispersal distance of the study organism and, for raster data,
   existing research suggests that simplifying the thematic resolution into
   discrete classes may result in low power to detect effects on gene flow.
   Therefore, the methods used to characterize the landscape between
   sampling sites may be a primary determinant for the spatial scale at
   which analytical results are applicable, and the use of only one
   sampling scale for a particular statistical method may lead researchers
   to overlook important factors affecting gene flow. The particular
   analytical technique used to correlate landscape data and genetic data
   may also influence results; common landscape-genetic methods may not be
   suitable for all study systems, particularly when the rate of landscape
   change is faster than can be resolved by common molecular markers.}},

Abstract = {{Measures of genetic structure among individuals or populations collected
   at different spatial locations across a landscape are commonly used as
   surrogate measures of functional (i.e. demographic or genetic)
   connectivity. In order to understand how landscape characteristics
   influence functional connectivity, resistance surfaces are typically
   created in a raster GIS environment. These resistance surfaces represent
   hypothesized relationships between landscape features and gene flow, and
   are based on underlying biological functions such as relative abundance
   or movement probabilities in different land cover types. The biggest
   challenge for calculating resistance surfaces is assignment of
   resistance values to different landscape features. Here, we first
   identify study objectives that are consistent with the use of resistance
   surfaces and critically review the various approaches that have been
   used to parameterize resistance surfaces and select optimal models in
   landscape genetics. We then discuss the biological assumptions and
   considerations that influence analyses using resistance surfaces, such
   as the relationship between gene flow and dispersal, how habitat
   suitability may influence animal movement, and how resistance surfaces
   can be translated into estimates of functional landscape connectivity.
   Finally, we outline novel approaches for creating optimal resistance
   surfaces using either simulation or computational methods, as well as
   alternatives to resistance surfaces (e.g. network and buffered paths).
   These approaches have the potential to improve landscape genetic
   analyses, but they also create new challenges. We conclude that no
   single way of using resistance surfaces is appropriate for every
   situation. We suggest that researchers carefully consider objectives,
   important biological assumptions and available parameterization and
   validation techniques when planning landscape genetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable interpretation of landscape genetic analyses depends on
   statistical methods that have high power to identify the correct process
   driving gene flow while rejecting incorrect alternative hypotheses.
   Little is known about statistical power and inference in
   individual-based landscape genetics. Our objective was to evaluate the
   power of causal-modelling with partial Mantel tests in individual-based
   landscape genetic analysis. We used a spatially explicit simulation
   model to generate genetic data across a spatially distributed population
   as functions of several alternative gene flow processes. This allowed us
   to stipulate the actual process that is in action, enabling formal
   evaluation of the strength of spurious correlations with incorrect
   models. We evaluated the degree to which naive correlational approaches
   can lead to incorrect attribution of the driver of observed genetic
   structure. Second, we evaluated the power of causal modelling with
   partial Mantel tests on resistance gradients to correctly identify the
   explanatory model and reject incorrect alternative models. Third, we
   evaluated how rapidly after the landscape genetic process is initiated
   that we are able to reliably detect the effect of the correct model and
   reject the incorrect models. Our analyses suggest that simple
   correlational analyses between genetic data and proposed explanatory
   models produce strong spurious correlations, which lead to incorrect
   inferences. We found that causal modelling was extremely effective at
   rejecting incorrect explanations and correctly identifying the true
   causal process. We propose a generalized framework for landscape
   genetics based on analysis of the spatial genetic relationships among
   individual organisms relative to alternative hypotheses that define
   functional relationships between landscape features and spatial
   population processes.}},

Abstract = {{Populations in fragmented landscapes experience reduced gene flow, lose
   genetic diversity over time and ultimately face greater extinction risk.
   Improving connectivity in fragmented landscapes is now a major focus of
   conservation biology. Designing effective wildlife corridors for this
   purpose, however, requires an accurate understanding of how landscapes
   shape gene flow. The preponderance of landscape resistance models
   generated to date, however, is subjectively parameterized based on
   expert opinion or proxy measures of gene flow. While the relatively few
   studies that use genetic data are more rigorous, frameworks they employ
   frequently yield models only weakly related to the observed patterns of
   genetic isolation. Here, we describe a new framework that uses expert
   opinion as a starting point. By systematically varying each model
   parameter, we sought to either validate the assumptions of expert
   opinion, or identify a peak of support for a new model more highly
   related to genetic isolation. This approach also accounts for
   interactions between variables, allows for nonlinear responses and
   excludes variables that reduce model performance. We demonstrate its
   utility on a population of mountain goats inhabiting a fragmented
   landscape in the Cascade Range, Washington.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the influence of landscape heterogeneity on genetic
   differentiation between migratory bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)
   populations in Glacier National Park, Montana. An information-theoretic
   approach was used to compare different conceptual models of dispersal
   associated with barriers, different models of isolation by distance, and
   the combined effects of barriers, waterway distance, patch size, and
   intra- and inter-drainage distribution of populations on genetic
   differentiation between bull trout populations. The effect of distance
   between populations on genetic differentiation was best explained by
   partitioning the effects of mainstem and tributary stream sections.
   Models that categorized barriers as having a one-way effect (i.e.
   allowed downstream dispersal) or a two-way effect were best supported.
   Additionally, patch size and the distribution of populations among
   drainages influenced genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation
   between bull trout populations in Glacier National Park is linked to
   landscape features that restrict dispersal. However, this analysis
   illustrates that modelling variability within landscape features, such
   as dispersal corridors, will benefit landscape genetic analyses.
   Additionally, the framework used for evaluating the effects of barriers
   must consider not just barrier presence, but also potential asymmetries
   in barrier effects with respect to the organism under investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining functional connectivity among occupied habitats is crucial
   for understanding metapopulation dynamics and species ecology. Landscape
   genetics has primarily focused on elucidating how ecological features
   between observations influence gene flow. Functional connectivity,
   however, may be the result of both these between-site (landscape
   resistance) landscape characteristics and at-site (patch quality)
   landscape processes that can be captured using network based models. We
   test hypotheses of functional connectivity that include both
   between-site and at-site landscape processes in metapopulations of
   Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) by employing a novel
   justification of gravity models for landscape genetics (eight
   microsatellite loci, 37 sites, n = 441). Primarily used in
   transportation and economic geography, gravity models are a unique
   approach as flow (e.g. gene flow) is explained as a function of three
   basic components: distance between sites, production/attraction (e.g.
   at-site landscape process) and resistance (e.g. between-site landscape
   process). The study system contains a network of nutrient poor high
   mountain lakes where we hypothesized a short growing season and complex
   topography between sites limit R. luteiventris gene flow. In addition,
   we hypothesized production of offspring is limited by breeding site
   characteristics such as the introduction of predatory fish and inherent
   site productivity. We found that R. luteiventris connectivity was
   negatively correlated with distance between sites, presence of predatory
   fish (at-site) and topographic complexity (between-site). Conversely,
   site productivity (as measured by heat load index, at-site) and growing
   season (as measured by frost-free period between-sites) were positively
   correlated with gene flow. The negative effect of predation and positive
   effect of site productivity, in concert with bottleneck tests, support
   the presence of source-sink dynamics. In conclusion, gravity models
   provide a powerful new modelling approach for examining a wide range of
   both basic and applied questions in landscape genetics.}},

   relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99\% of
   the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and
   exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and
   long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed
   almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic
   distances (F(ST) and D(c)) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783
   samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding
   populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape.
   Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not
   improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of
   topographically corrected straight lines (P < 0.01). After testing for
   autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information
   theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil
   type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to
   rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by
   genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land
   cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for
   long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided
   the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the
   least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape
   genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and
   differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be
   used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity between spatially disjoint habitat patches is a
   key factor for the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes.
   Modelling landscape connectivity to identify potential dispersal
   corridors requires information about those landscape features affecting
   dispersal. Here we present a new approach using spatial and genetic data
   of a highly fragmented population of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in
   the Black Forest, Germany, to investigate effects of landscape structure
   on gene flow and to parameterize a spatially explicit corridor model for
   conservation purposes. Mantel tests and multiple regressions on distance
   matrices were employed to detect and quantify the effect of different
   landscape features on relatedness among individuals, while controlling
   for the effect of geographic distance. We extrapolated the results to an
   area-wide landscape permeability map and developed a new corridor model
   that incorporates stochasticity in simulating animal movement. The model
   was evaluated using both a partition of the data previously set apart
   and independent observation data of dispersing birds. Most land cover
   variables (such as coniferous forest, forest edges, agricultural land,
   roads, settlements) and one topographic variable (topographic exposure)
   were significantly correlated with gene flow. Although inter-individual
   relatedness inherently varies greatly and the variance explained by
   geographic distance and landscape structure was low, the permeability
   map and the corridor model significantly explained relatedness in the
   validation data and the spatial distribution of dispersing birds. Thus,
   landscape structure measurably affected within-population gene flow in
   the study area. By converting these effects into spatially explicit
   information our model enables localizing priority areas for the
   preservation or restoration of metapopulation connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The relative influence of habitat loss, fragmentation and matrix
   heterogeneity on the viability of populations is a critical area of
   conservation research that remains unresolved. Using simulation
   modelling, we provide an analysis of the influence both patch size and
   patch isolation have on abundance, effective population size (N-e) and
   F-ST. An individual-based, spatially explicit population model based on
   15 years of field work on the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides
   borealis) was applied to different landscape configurations. The
   variation in landscape patterns was summarized using spatial statistics
   based on O-ring statistics. By regressing demographic and genetics
   attributes that emerged across the landscape treatments against
   proportion of total habitat and O-ring statistics, we show that O-ring
   statistics provide an explicit link between population processes,
   habitat area, and critical thresholds of fragmentation that affect those
   processes. Spatial distances among land cover classes that affect
   biological processes translated into critical scales at which the
   measures of landscape structure correlated best with genetic indices.
   Therefore our study infers pattern from process, which contrasts with
   past studies of landscape genetics. We found that population genetic
   structure was more strongly affected by fragmentation than population
   size, which suggests that examining only population size may limit
   recognition of fragmentation effects that erode genetic variation. If
   effective population size is used to set recovery goals for endangered
   species, then habitat fragmentation effects may be sufficiently strong
   to prevent evaluation of recovery based on the ratio of census:effective
   population size alone.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled biological and physical oceanographic models are powerful tools
   for studying connectivity among marine populations because they simulate
   the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and larval
   characteristics. However, while the models themselves have been
   parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated
   patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field
   observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical
   oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic
   patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing
   these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and
   mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide
   insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal
   ocean. We use a high-resolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model
   for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal
   of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic
   patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices
   did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a
   mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch
   generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that
   including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction
   and/or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit
   between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and
   a range of combined larval retention and southern input values
   dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial
   genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population
   genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can
   provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Marine species frequently show weak and/or complex genetic structuring
   that is commonly dismissed as `chaotic' genetic patchiness and
   ecologically uninformative. Here, using three datasets that individually
   feature weak chaotic patchiness, we demonstrate that combining
   inferences across species and incorporating environmental data can
   greatly improve the predictive value of marine population genetics
   studies on small spatial scales. Significant correlations in genetic
   patterns of microsatellite markers among three species, kelp bass
   Paralabrax clathratus, Kellet's whelk Kelletia kelletii and California
   spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus, in the Southern California Bight
   suggest that slight differences in diversity and pairwise
   differentiation across sampling sites are not simply noise or chaotic
   patchiness, but are ecologically meaningful. To test whether
   interspecies correlations potentially result from shared environmental
   drivers of genetic patterns, we assembled data on kelp bed size, sea
   surface temperature and estimates of site-to-site migration probability
   derived from a high resolution multi-year ocean circulation model. These
   data served as predictor variables in linear models of genetic diversity
   and linear mixed models of genetic differentiation that were assessed
   with information-theoretic model selection. Kelp was the most
   informative predictor of genetics for all three species, but ocean
   circulation also played a minor role for kelp bass. The shared patterns
   suggest a single spatial marine management strategy may effectively
   protect genetic diversity of multiple species. This study demonstrates
   the power of environmental and ecological data to shed light on weak
   genetic patterns and highlights the need for future focus on a
   mechanistic understanding of the links between oceanography, ecology and
   genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic consequences of shifting species distributions
   is critical for evaluating the impact of climate-induced distributional
   changes. However, the demographic expansion associated with the
   colonization process typically takes place across a heterogeneous
   environment, with population sizes and migration rates varying across
   the landscape. Here we describe an approach for coupling
   ecological-niche models (ENMs) with demographic and genetic models to
   explore the genetic consequences of distributional shifts across a
   heterogeneous landscape. Analyses of a flightless grasshopper from the
   sky islands of the Rocky Mountains of North America are used to show how
   biologically informed predictions can be generated about the genetic
   consequences of a colonization process across a spatially and temporally
   heterogeneous landscape (i.e. the suitability of habitats for the
   montane species differs across the landscape and is itself not static,
   with the displacement of contemporary populations into glacial refugia).
   By using (i) ENMs for current climatic conditions and the last glacial
   maximum to (ii) parameterize a demographic model of the colonization
   process, which then (iii) informs coalescent simulations, a set of
   models can be generated that capture different processes associated with
   distributional shifts. We discuss how the proposed approach for model
   generation can be integrated into a statistical framework for estimating
   key demographic parameters and testing hypotheses about the conditions
   for which distributional shifts may (or may not) enhance species
   divergence, including the importance of habitat stability, past
   gene-flow among currently isolated populations, and maintenance of
   refugial populations in multiple geographic regions.}},

   and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this
   manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape
   genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived
   from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially
   confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic
   history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based
   simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of
   genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic
   distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional
   stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance
   D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract
   the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape
   genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert
   succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed
   phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii,
   removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences
   our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of
   spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic
   analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic basis of species adaptation in the context of
   global change poses one of the greatest challenges of this century.
   Although we have begun to understand the molecular basis of adaptation
   in those species for which whole genome sequences are available, the
   molecular basis of adaptation is still poorly understood for most
   non-model species. In this paper, we outline major challenges and future
   research directions for correlating environmental factors with molecular
   markers to identify adaptive genetic variation, and point to research
   gaps in the application of landscape genetics to real-world problems
   arising from global change, such as the ability of organisms to adapt
   over rapid time scales. High throughput sequencing generates vast
   quantities of molecular data to address the challenge of studying
   adaptive genetic variation in non-model species. Here, we suggest that
   improvements in the sampling design should consider spatial dependence
   among sampled individuals. Then, we describe available statistical
   approaches for integrating spatial dependence into landscape analyses of
   adaptive genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of rainforest diversification that simultaneously consider the
   effects of genetic drift and natural selection are rare. We use
   Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism genome scans of the African
   rainforest lizard Trachylepis affinis from Cameroon to examine the
   spatial patterns and environmental associations of both neutrally
   evolving loci and those thought to be under selection. Bayesian
   selection scans revealed that approximately 7\% of the genome may be
   under divergent selection. Using non-linear environmental modelling
   techniques, we fit patterns of genetic differentiation recovered from
   the pooled neutral data and from individual loci showing a signature of
   natural selection. Neutral differentiation occurred along a cline from
   coastal lowland rainforest inland toward the gallery forests-savanna
   mosaic (ecotone), and was associated with both geographic distance and
   changing precipitation patterns. Loci under selection were
   differentiated predominantly along the forest-ecotone gradient-in
   concordance with morphological divergence in traits related to fitness.
   A second set of these loci was differentiated between lowland and
   montane habitats. A third set of loci was indicative of divergent
   selection between rainforest refugia. Niche models and demographic
   signals in mitochondrial sequence data support a population expansion
   out of a core rainforest area into savanna since the last glacial
   maximum. Our findings indicate adaptive diversification in T. affinis
   may be taking place along the forest-ecotone gradient during range
   expansions or contractions, and that refugial isolation augmented by
   divergent adaptation to different rainforest environments appears to
   play a less significant role.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation is often arrayed in latitudinal or altitudinal clines,
   reflecting either adaptation along environmental gradients, migratory
   routes, or both. For forest trees, climate is one of the most important
   drivers of adaptive phenotypic traits. Correlations of single and
   multilocus genotypes with environmental gradients have been identified
   for a variety of forest trees. These correlations are interpreted
   normally as evidence of natural selection. Here, we use a genome-wide
   dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typed from 1730 loci
   in 682 loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees sampled from 54 local
   populations covering the full-range of the species to examine allelic
   correlations to five multivariate measures of climate. Applications of a
   Bayesian generalized linear mixed model, where the climate variable was
   a fixed effect and an estimated variance-covariance matrix controlled
   random effects due to shared population history, identified several
   well-supported SNPs associating to principal components corresponding to
   geography, temperature, growing degree-days, precipitation and aridity.
   Functional annotation of those genes with putative orthologs in
   Arabidopsis revealed a diverse set of abiotic stress response genes
   ranging from transmembrane proteins to proteins involved in sugar
   metabolism. Many of these SNPs also had large allele frequency
   differences among populations (F(ST) = 0.10-0.35). These results
   illustrate a first step towards a ecosystem perspective of population
   genomics for non-model organisms, but also highlight the need for
   further integration of the methodologies employed in spatial statistics,
   population genetics and climate modeling during scans for signatures of
   natural selection from genomic data.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid climate change jeopardizes tree populations by shifting current
   climate zones. To avoid extinction, tree populations must tolerate,
   adapt, or migrate. Here we investigate geographic patterns of genetic
   variation in valley oak, Quercus lobata Nee, to assess how underlying
   genetic structure of populations might influence this species' ability
   to survive climate change. First, to understand how genetic lineages
   shape spatial genetic patterns, we examine historical patterns of
   colonization. Second, we examine the correlation between multivariate
   nuclear genetic variation and climatic variation. Third, to illustrate
   how geographic genetic variation could interact with regional patterns
   of 21st Century climate change, we produce region-specific bioclimatic
   distributions of valley oak using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) models based
   on downscaled historical (1971-2000) and future (2070-2100) climate
   grids. Future climatologies are based on a moderate-high (A2) carbon
   emission scenario and two different global climate models. Chloroplast
   markers indicate historical range-wide connectivity via colonization,
   especially in the north. Multivariate nuclear genotypes show a strong
   association with climate variation that provides opportunity for local
   adaptation to the conditions within their climatic envelope. Comparison
   of regional current and projected patterns of climate suitability
   indicates that valley oaks grow in distinctly different climate
   conditions in different parts of their range. Our models predict widely
   different regional outcomes from local displacement of a few kilometres
   to hundreds of kilometres. We conclude that the relative importance of
   migration, adaptation, and tolerance are likely to vary widely for
   populations among regions, and that late 21st Century conditions could
   lead to regional extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenges facing landscape geneticists studying adaptive
   variation is to include all the environmental variables that might be
   correlated with allele frequencies across the genome. One way of
   identifying loci that are possibly under selection is to see which ones
   are associated with environmental gradient or heterogeneity. Since it is
   difficult to measure all environmental variables, one may take advantage
   of the spatial nature of environmental filters to incorporate the effect
   of unaccounted environmental variables in the analysis. Assuming that
   the spatial signature of these variables is broad-scaled, broad-scale
   Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) can be included as explanatory variables
   in the analysis as proxies for unmeasured environmental variables. We
   applied this approach to two data sets of the alpine plant Arabis
   alpina. The first consisted of 140 AFLP loci sampled at 130 sites across
   the European Alps (large scale). The second one consisted of 712 AFLP
   loci sampled at 93 sites (regional scale) in three mountain massifs
   (local scale) of the French Alps. For each scale, we regressed the
   frequencies of each AFLP allele on a set of eco-climatic and MEM
   variables as predictors. Twelve (large scale) and 11\% (regional scale)
   of all loci were detected as significantly correlated to at least one of
   the predictors (R(adj)(2) > 0.5), and, except for one massif, 17\% at
   the local scale. After accounting for spatial effects, temperature and
   precipitation were the two major determinants of allele distributions.

Abstract = {{Reconstructing the history of populations is a longstanding goal of
   molecular ecologists. In addition to a better understanding of the past,
   it is hoped that this knowledge would also facilitate predictions
   regarding species' responses to future events such as climate change.
   The traditional way of doing this is through the fossil record, but
   these historical records are often incomplete. Inferring historical
   demography from patterns of nucleotide variability can help to fill
   these gaps. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Holliday et al. (2010)
   glimpse into the demographic past of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, an
   economically and ecologically important species native to northwestern
   United States and Canada, by examining the site frequency spectrum (SFS)
   of 153 loci in six populations covering the species entire range.}},

   might be a high number of species waiting to be discovered. In this
   issue Damm et al. (2010) use a combination of genetic, morphological and
   ecological evidence to identify the first cryptic species complex found
   within dragonflies (insect order Odonata). Their findings add more

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have provided some
   of the clearest examples of how natural selection generates discordances
   between adaptive and neutral variation in natural populations. The type
   and intensity of selection as well as the strength of genetic drift are
   believed to be important in shaping the resulting pattern of MHC
   diversity. However, evaluating the relative contribution of multiple
   microevolutionary forces is challenging, and empirical studies have
   reported contrasting results. For instance, balancing selection has been
   invoked to explain high levels of MHC diversity and low population
   differentiation in comparison with other nuclear markers. Other studies
   have shown that genetic drift can sometimes overcome selection and then
   patterns of genetic variation at adaptive loci cannot be discerned from
   those occurring at neutral markers. Both empirical and simulated data
   also indicate that loss of genetic diversity at adaptive loci can occur
   faster than at neutral loci when selection and population bottlenecks
   act simultaneously. Diversifying selection, on the other hand, explains
   accelerated MHC divergence as the result of spatial variation in
   pathogen-mediated selective regimes. Because of all these possible
   scenarios and outcomes, collecting information from as many study
   systems as possible, is crucial to enhance our understanding about the
   evolutionary forces driving MHC polymorphism. In this issue, Miller and
   co-workers present an illuminating contribution by combining neutral
   markers (microsatellites) and adaptive MHC class I loci during the
   investigation of genetic differentiation across island populations of
   tuatara Sphenodon punctatus. Their study of geographical variation
   reveals a major role of genetic drift in shaping MHC variation, yet they
   also discuss some support for diversifying selection.}},

Abstract = {{G(ST)-values and its relatives (F-ST) belong to the most used parameters
   to define genetic differences between populations. Originally, they were
   developed for allozymes with very low number of alleles. Using highly
   polymorphic microsatellite markers it was often puzzling that
   G(ST)-values were very low but statistically significant. In their
   papers, Jost (2008) and Hedrick (2005) explained that G(ST)-values do
   not show genetic differentiation, and Jost suggested calculating
   D-values instead. Theoretical mathematical considerations are often
   difficult to follow; therefore, we chose an applied approach comparing
   two artificial populations with different number of alleles at equal
   frequencies and known genetic divergence. Our results show that even for
   more than one allele per population G(ST)-values do not calculate
   population differentiation correctly; in contrast, D-values do reflect
   the genetic differentiation indicating that data based on G(ST)-values
   need to be re-evaluated. In our approach, statistical evaluations
   remained similar. We provide information about the impact of different
   sample sizes on D-values in relation to number of alleles and genetic
   divergence.}},

Abstract = {{Deviations of the site frequency spectrum of mutations (SFS) from
   neutral expectations may be caused by natural selection or by
   demographic processes such as population subdivision or temporal changes
   in population size. As most widespread temperate and boreal tree species
   have expanded from glacial refugia in the past 13 000 years,
   colonization bottlenecks associated with this migration may have left
   variable demographic signatures among geographic populations
   corresponding to distance from the refugia. To determine whether the
   signature of postglacial re-colonization has skewed the SFS in the
   widely distributed conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.)
   Carr.), we re-sequenced 153 nuclear genes in six populations from across
   the species range. We found that while the SFS for the pooled sample
   produced negative values for Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H, these
   statistics exhibited strong clinal variation when populations were
   analysed separately (R2 = 0.84, P = 0.007 for Tajima's D and R2 = 0.65,
   P = 0.033 for Fay and Wu's H). When historical bottlenecks of varying
   age were simulated using approximate Bayesian computation, distance of
   populations from the southern range limit explained most of the
   variation in bottleneck timing among populations (R2 = 0.89, P = 0.003).
   These data suggest that sequential population bottlenecks during
   postglacial re-colonization have resulted in diverse among-population
   signatures within the contemporary SFS in Sitka spruce, with rare
   variants more common in the south, and medium-frequency variants more
   common in the north. Our results also emphasize the need to consider
   sampling strategy and to explore population-specific null demographic
   models in surveys of nucleotide variation in widely distributed species.}},

Abstract = {{Cave animals have historically attracted the attention of evolutionary
   biologists because of their bizarre `regressive' characters and
   convergent evolution. However, understanding of their biogeographic and
   evolutionary history, including mechanisms of speciation, has remained
   elusive. In the last decade, molecular data have been obtained for
   subterranean taxa and their surface relatives, which have allowed some
   of the classical debates on the evolution of cave fauna to be revisited.
   Here, we review some of the major studies, focusing on the contribution
   of phylogeography in the following areas: biogeographic history and the
   relative roles of dispersal and vicariance, colonization history,
   cryptic species diversity and modes of speciation of cave animals. We
   further consider the limitations of current research and prospects for
   the future. Phylogeographic studies have confirmed that cave species are
   often cryptic, with highly restricted distributions, but have also shown
   that their divergence and potential speciation may occur despite the
   presence of gene flow from surface populations. Significantly,
   phylogeographic studies have provided evidence for speciation and
   adaptive evolution within the confines of cave environments, questioning
   the assumption that cave species evolved directly from surface
   ancestors. Recent technical developments involving `next generation' DNA
   sequencing and theoretical developments in coalescent and population
   modelling are likely to revolutionize the field further, particularly in
   the study of speciation and the genetic basis of adaptation and
   convergent evolution within subterranean habitats. In summary,
   phylogeographic studies have provided an unprecedented insight into the
   evolution of these unique fauna, and the future of the field should be
   inspiring and data rich.}},

Abstract = {{Modern taxonomy requires an analytical approach incorporating all lines
   of evidence into decision-making. Such an approach can enhance both
   species identification and species discovery. The character-based DNA
   barcode method provides a molecular data set that can be incorporated
   into classical taxonomic data such that the discovery of new species can
   be made in an analytical framework that includes multiple sources of
   data. We here illustrate such a corroborative framework in a dragonfly
   model system that permits the discovery of two new, but visually cryptic
   species. In the African dragonfly genus Trithemis three distinct genetic
   clusters can be detected which could not be identified by using
   classical taxonomic characters. In order to test the hypothesis of two
   new species, DNA-barcodes from different sequence markers (ND1 and COI)
   were combined with morphological, ecological and biogeographic data
   sets. Phylogenetic analyses and incorporation of all data sets into a
   scheme called taxonomic circle highly supports the hypothesis of two new
   species. Our case study suggests an analytical approach to modern
   taxonomy that integrates data sets from different disciplines, thereby
   increasing the ease and reliability of both species discovery and
   species assignment.}},

Abstract = {{Neutral genetic markers are commonly used to understand the effects of
   fragmentation and population bottlenecks on genetic variation in
   threatened species. Although neutral markers are useful for inferring
   population history, the analysis of functional genes is required to
   determine the significance of any observed geographical differences in
   variation. The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are
   well-known examples of genes of adaptive significance and are
   particularly relevant to conservation because of their role in pathogen
   resistance. In this study, we survey diversity at MHC class I loci
   across a range of tuatara populations. We compare the levels of MHC
   variation with that observed at neutral microsatellite markers to
   determine the relative roles of balancing selection, diversifying
   selection and genetic drift in shaping patterns of MHC variation in
   isolated populations. In general, levels of MHC variation within tuatara
   populations are concordant with microsatellite variation. Tuatara
   populations are highly differentiated at MHC genes, particularly between
   the northern and Cook Strait regions, and a trend towards diversifying
   selection across populations was observed. However, overall our results
   indicate that population bottlenecks and isolation have a larger
   influence on patterns of MHC variation in tuatara populations than
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal processes of fungal plant pathogens can be inferred from
   analysis of spatial genetic structures resulting from recent range
   expansion. The relative importance of long-distance dispersal (LDD)
   events vs. gradual dispersal in shaping population structures depends on
   the geographical scale considered. The fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis,
   pathogenic on banana, is an example of a recent worldwide epidemic.
   Founder effects in this species were detected at both global and
   continental scale, suggesting stochastic spread of the disease through
   LDD events. In this study, we analysed the structure of M. fijiensis
   populations in two recently (similar to 1979-1980) colonized areas in
   Costa Rica and Cameroon. Isolates collected in 10-15 sites distributed
   along a similar to 250- to 300- km-long transect in each country were
   analysed using 19 microsatellite markers. We detected low-to-moderate
   genetic differentiation among populations in both countries and
   isolation by distance in Cameroon. Combined with historical data, these
   observations suggest continuous range expansion at the scale of
   banana-production area through gradual dispersal of spores. However,
   both countries displayed specific additional signatures of colonization:
   a sharp discontinuity in gene frequencies was observed along the
   Cameroon transect, while the Costa Rican populations seemed not yet to
   have reached genetic equilibrium. These differences in the genetic
   characteristics of M. fijiensis populations in two recently colonized
   areas are discussed in the light of historical data on disease spread
   and ecological data on landscape features.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of dissemination of the environmental human pathogen Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus are uncertain. The O3:K6 clone was restricted to Asia
   until its detection along the Peruvian coasts and in northern Chile in
   1997 in phase with the arrival of El Nino waters. A subsequent emergence
   of O3:K6 strains was detected in austral Chile in 2004. The origin of
   these 1997 and 2004 population radiations has not yet been conclusively
   determined. Multiple loci VNTR analysis using seven polymorphic loci was
   carried out with a number of representative strains from Asia, Peru and
   Chile to determine their genetic characteristics and population
   structure. Asian and Chilean subpopulations were the most genetically
   distant groups with an intermediate subpopulation in Peru. Population
   structure inferred from a minimum-spanning tree and Bayesian analysis
   divided the populations into two genetically distinct groups, consistent
   with the epidemic dynamics of the O3:K6 clone in South America. One
   group comprised strains from the original Asiatic population and strains
   arriving in Peru and Chile in 1997. The second group included the
   remaining Peruvian Strains and Chilean strains obtained from Puerto
   Montt in 2004. The analysis of the arrival of the O3:K6 clone at the
   Pacific coasts of South America has provided novel insights linking the
   origin of the invasion in 1997 to Asian populations and describing the
   successful establishment of the O3:K6 populations, first in Peru and
   subsequently in the South of Chile owing to a possible radiation of
   Peruvian populations.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic monitoring has rarely been used for wildlife translocations
   despite the potential benefits this approach offers, compared to
   traditional field-based methods. We applied genetic monitoring to the
   reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008,
   2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples
   obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic
   and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition.
   Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and
   revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to >
   27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear
   samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region
   surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found
   up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with
   expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41.
   However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates
   were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all
   cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness
   increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was
   extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive
   information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for
   implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in
   the Italian Alps. This study provides a model for other reintroduction
   programmes by demonstrating how genetic monitoring can be implemented to
   uncover aspects of the demography, ecology and genetics of small and
   reintroduced populations that will advance our understanding of the
   processes influencing their viability, evolution, and successful
   restoration.}},

Abstract = {{To become invasive, exotic species have to succeed in the consecutive
   phases of introduction, naturalization, and invasion. Each of these
   phases leaves traces in genetic structure, which may affect the species'
   success in subsequent phases. We examined this interplay of genetic
   structure and invasion dynamics in the South African Ragwort (Senecio
   inaequidens), one of Europe's fastest plant invaders. We used AFLP and
   microsatellite markers to analyze 19 native African and 32 invasive
   European populations. In combination with historic data, we
   distinguished invasion routes and traced them back to the native source
   areas. This revealed that different introduction sites had markedly
   different success in the three invasion phases. Notably, an observed
   lag-phase in Northern Germany was evidently not terminated by factors
   increasing the invasiveness of the resident population but by invasive
   spread from another introduction centre. The lineage invading Central
   Europe was introduced to sites in which winters are more benign than in
   the native source region. Subsequently, this lineage spread into areas
   in which winter temperatures match the native climate more closely.
   Genetic diversity clearly increases with population age in Europe and
   less clearly decreases with spread rate up to population establishment.
   This indicates that gene flow along well-connected invasion routes
   counteracted losses of genetic diversity during rapid spread. In
   summary, this study suggests that multiple introductions, environmental
   preadaptation and high gene flow along invasion routes contributed to
   the success of this rapid invader. More generally, it demonstrates the
   benefit of combining genetic, historical, and climatic data for
   understanding biological invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive radiations likely underlie much of the world's diversity,
   especially that of hyper-diverse regions. They are usually characterized
   by a burst of speciation early in their evolutionary history, a pattern
   which can be detected using population genetic tools. The Cape Floristic
   Region (CFR) of southwestern South Africa is home to many spectacular
   plant radiations. Here, we investigate the white proteas (Protea section
   Exsertae), a typical CFR radiation, to determine if it demonstrates the
   burst of speciation associated with adaptive radiations in recent
   models. Inferences from individual assignment, tree-based population
   relationships, and pairwise F-statistics based on 10 microsatellite loci
   reveal that while the white proteas radiated recently they did not
   radiate explosively. In addition, we found evidence that there is little
   gene flow between sampled populations of most species. Taken together,
   these results demonstrate that within a small clade, the processes
   underlying the radiation are different from those envisioned by current
   models of adaptive radiation and suggest that geographical isolation
   could have played a role in the diversification of the group. Our study
   implicates both adaptive and non-adaptive processes in the evolution of
   botanical diversity of the CFR.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis of gene flow between species with large differences in
   chromosome numbers has rarely been tested in the wild, mainly because
   species of different ploidy are commonly assumed to be reproductively
   isolated from each other because of instantaneous and strong postzygotic
   barriers. In this study, a broad-scale survey of molecular variation was
   carried out between two orchid species with different ploidy levels:
   Epidendrum fulgens (2n = 2x = 24 chromosomes) and Epidendrum
   puniceoluteum (2n = 4x = 52 chromosomes). To test the strength of their
   reproductive barriers, we investigated the distribution of genetic
   variation in sympatric and allopatric populations of these two species
   and conducted crossing experiments. Nuclear and plastid microsatellite
   loci were used to genotype 463 individuals from eight populations across
   the geographical range of both species along the Brazilian coastal
   plain. All six sympatric populations analysed presented hybrid zones,
   indicating that hybridization between E. fulgens and E. puniceoluteum is
   a common phenomenon. Bayesian assignment analysis detected the presence
   of F(1) and F(2) individuals and also signs of introgression,
   demonstrating a high potential for interspecific gene flow.
   Introgression occurs preferentially from E. fulgens to E. puniceoluteum.
   Pure parental individuals of both species display strong
   genotype-habitat associations, indicating that environment-dependent
   selection could be acting in all hybrid zones. This study suggests that
   hybridization and introgression are evolutionary processes playing a
   role in the diversification of Epidendrum and indicates the importance
   of investigations of hybrid zones in understanding reproductive barriers
   and speciation processes in Neotropical orchid species.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The three-spined stickleback is a widespread Holarctic species complex
   that radiated from the sea into freshwaters after the retreat of the
   Pleistocene ice sheets. In Switzerland, sticklebacks were absent with
   the exception of the far northwest, but different introduced populations
   have expanded to occupy a wide range of habitats since the late 19th
   century. A well-studied adaptive phenotypic trait in sticklebacks is the
   number of lateral plates. With few exceptions, freshwater and marine
   populations in Europe are fixed for either the low plated phenotype or
   the fully plated phenotype, respectively. Switzerland, in contrast,
   harbours in close proximity the full range of phenotypic variation known
   from across the continent. We addressed the phylogeographic origins of
   Swiss sticklebacks using mitochondrial partial cytochrome b and control
   region sequences. We found only five different haplotypes but these
   originated from three distinct European regions, fixed for different
   plate phenotypes. These lineages occur largely in isolation at opposite
   ends of Switzerland, but co-occur in a large central part. Across the
   country, we found a strong correlation between a microsatellite linked
   to the high plate ectodysplasin allele and the mitochondrial haplotype
   from a region where the fully plated phenotype is fixed. Phylogenomic
   and population genomic analysis of 481 polymorphic amplified fragment
   length polymorphism loci indicate genetic admixture in the central part
   of the country. The same part of the country also carries elevated
   within-population phenotypic variation. We conclude that during the
   recent invasive range expansion of sticklebacks in Switzerland, adaptive
   and neutral between-population genetic variation was converted into
   within-population variation, raising the possibility that hybridization
   between colonizing lineages contributed to the ecological success of
   sticklebacks in Switzerland.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used a comparative genome scan to examine patterns of
   population differentiation with respect to host plant use in
   Hesperotettix viridis, a Nearctic oligophagous grasshopper locally
   specialized on various Asteraceae including Solidago, Gutierrezia, and
   Ericameria. We identified amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   loci with significantly elevated F(ST) (outlier loci) in multiple
   different-host and same-host comparisons of populations while
   controlling for geographic distance. By comparing the number and
   identities of outlier loci in different-host vs. same-host comparisons,
   we found evidence of host plant-related divergent selection for some
   population comparisons (Solidago- vs. Gutierrezia-feeders), while other
   comparisons (Ericameria- vs. Gutierrezia-feeders) failed to demonstrate
   a strong role for host association in population differentiation. In
   comparisons of Solidago- vs. Gutierrezia-feeding populations, a
   relatively high number of outlier loci observed repeatedly in
   different-host comparisons (35\% of all outliers and 2.7\% of all 625
   AFLP loci) indicated a significant role for host-related selection in
   contributing to overall genomic differentiation in this grasshopper.
   Mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed a star-shaped phylogeny with no
   host- or geography-related structure, low nucleotide diversity, and high
   haplotype diversity, suggesting a recent population expansion. mtDNA
   data do not suggest a long period of isolation in separate glacial
   refugia but are instead more compatible with a single glacial refugium
   and more recent divergence in host use. Our study adds to research
   documenting heterogeneity in differentiation across the genome as a
   consequence of divergent natural selection, a phenomenon that may occur
   as part of the process of ecological speciation.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Within most island archipelagos, such as the Galapagos, similar
   ecological gradients are found on geographically isolated islands.
   Species radiations in response to these ecological gradients may follow
   different scenarios being (i) a single habitat specialization event
   followed by secondary colonization of each ecotype on the different
   islands or (ii) repeated and parallel habitat specialization on each
   island separately. This latter scenario has been considered less likely
   as gene flow might hamper such ecotypic differentiation. At least for
   the Galapagos, the extent to which this process is involved in species
   radiations remains yet poorly understood. Within the wolf spider genus
   Hogna, seven species are described that can be divided into three
   different ecotypes based on general morphology and habitat preference
   i.e. species that inhabit the pampa vegetation in the highlands, species
   that occur in coastal dry habitats and one generalist species.
   Comparison of the species phylogeny based on one mitochondrial (COI) and
   one nuclear (28S) gene fragment convincingly demonstrates that `pampa'
   and `coastal dry' species evolved in parallel on the islands Santa Cruz
   and San Cristobal. Despite the observation that allozymes analysis
   indicated that each species forms a distinct genetic cluster,
   phylogenetic divergence within these species complexes was very low and
   paraphyletic and most likely due to hybridization rather than incomplete
   lineage sorting, as demonstrated for the Santa Cruz species complex.
   This suggests that within-island speciation occurred under low levels of
   gene flow. Species phylogeny in general did not follow the progression
   of island emergence as a molecular clock analysis suggested that island
   endemic species may have diverged after as well as before the emergence
   of the islands. This represents the first clear example of parallel and
   within-island speciation because of habitat specialization on the
   Galapagos and that such divergence most likely occurred under historic
   gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Species with similar geographical distribution patterns are often
   assumed to have a shared biogeographical history, an assumption that can
   be tested with a combination of molecular, spatial, and environmental
   data. This study investigates three lineages of Hyperolius frogs with
   concordant ranges within the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot to
   determine whether allopatric populations of co-distributed lineages
   shared a parallel biogeographical response to their shared paleoclimatic
   histories. The roles of refugial distributions, isolation, and climate
   cycles in shaping their histories are examined through Hierarchical
   Approximate Bayesian Computation, comparative phylogeography, and
   comparisons of current and past geographical distributions using
   ecological niche models. Results from these analyses show these three
   lineages to have independent evolutionary histories, which current
   spatial configurations of sparsely available habitat (montane wetlands)
   have moulded into convergent geographical ranges. In spite of
   independent phylogeographical histories, diversification events are
   temporally concentrated, implying that past vicariant events were
   significant at the generic level. This mixture of apparently disparate
   histories is likely due to quantifiably different patterns of expansion
   and retreat among species in response to past climate cycles. Combining
   climate modelling and phylogeographical data can reveal unrecognized
   complexities in the evolution of co-distributed taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The current geographical distribution of the ninespine stickleback
   (Pungitius pungitius) was shaped in large part by the glaciation events
   of the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Mya-10 Kya). Previous efforts to elucidate
   the phylogeographical history of the ninespine stickleback in North
   America have focused on a limited set of morphological traits, some of
   which are likely subject to widespread convergent evolution, thereby
   potentially obscuring relationships among populations. In this study, we
   used genetic information from both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences
   and nuclear microsatellite markers to determine the phylogenetic
   relationships among ninespine stickleback populations. We found that
   ninespine sticklebacks in North America probably dispersed from at least
   three glacial refugia-the Mississippi, Bering, and Atlantic refugia-not
   two as previously thought. However, by applying a molecular clock to our
   mtDNA data, we found that these three groups diverged long before the
   most recent glacial period. Our new phylogeny serves as a critical
   framework for examining the evolution of derived traits in this species,
   including adaptive phenotypes that evolved multiple times in different
   lineages. In particular, we inferred that loss of the pelvic (hind fin)
   skeleton probably evolved independently in populations descended from
   each of the three putative North American refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Although the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is ubiquitous in insects,
   it has a unique relationship with New World ants on which particular
   bacterial strains have specialized. However, data are from distantly
   related hosts and detailed phylogenetic information which could reveal
   transmission dynamics are lacking. Here, we investigate host-Wolbachia
   relationships in the monophyletic fungus-growing ant tribe Attini,
   screening 23 species and using multilocus sequence typing to reliably
   identify Wolbachia strains. This technique reduces the significant
   problem of recombination seen using traditional single gene techniques.
   The relationship between Wolbachia and the fungus-growing ants appears
   complex and dynamic. There is evidence of co-cladogenesis, supporting
   vertical transmission; however, this is incomplete, demonstrating that
   horizontal transmission has also occurred. Importantly, the infection
   prevalence is frequently different between closely related taxa, with
   the Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants appearing particularly prone to
   infection and there being no consistent relationship with any of the
   major life history transitions. We suggest that infection loss and
   horizontal transmission have driven epidemics or selective sweeps of
   Wolbachia, resulting in multiple gains and losses of infection across
   the fungus-growing ants.}},

   associations in five closely related species of the genus Orchis}},

Abstract = {{Most orchid species rely on mycorrhizae to complete their life cycle.
   Despite a growing body of literature identifying orchid mycorrhizal
   associations, the nature and specificity of the association between
   orchid species and mycorrhizal fungi remains largely an open question.
   Nonetheless, better insights into these obligate plant-fungus
   associations are indispensable for understanding the biology and
   conservation of orchid populations. To investigate orchid mycorrhizal
   associations in five species of the genus Orchis (O. anthropophora, O.
   mascula, O. militaris, O. purpurea, and O. simia), we developed internal
   transcribed spacer-based DNA arrays from extensive clone library
   sequence data sets, enabling rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide
   range of basidiomycetous mycorrhizal fungi. A low degree of specificity
   was observed, with two orchid species associating with nine different
   fungal partners. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of
   Orchis mycorrhizal fungi are members of the Tulasnellaceae, but in some
   plants, members of the Thelephoraceae, Cortinariaceae and
   Ceratobasidiaceae were also found. In all species except one (O.
   mascula), individual plants associated with more than one fungus
   simultaneously, and in some cases, associations with >= 3 mycorrhizal
   fungi at the same time were identified. Nestedness analysis showed that
   orchid mycorrhizal associations were significantly nested, suggesting
   asymmetric specialization and a dense core of interactions created by
   symmetric interactions between generalist species. Our results add
   support to the growing literature that multiple associations may be
   common among orchids. Low specificity or preference for a widespread
   fungal symbiont may partly explain the wide distribution of the
   investigated species.}},

Abstract = {{To use the `lessons of the Pleistocene' to forecast the biotic effects
   of climate change, we must parse the effects of history and ecology in
   the Quaternary record. The preponderance of Northern Hemisphere studies
   of biotic responses to climate change provides a limited set of players
   and environmental circumstances with which to decouple these drivers. In
   this issue Lessa et al. (2010) examine population structure in 14
   species of mice distributed across Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in
   southern South America. In the Southern Cone, glacial ice was alpine,
   not polar; major habitats were (and are) oriented N-S, not E-W; and
   habitable land area actually increased, not decreased, at the height of
   the last glacial maximum (LGM). Despite these differences, there is
   evidence for poleward demographic expansion in 10 of the 14 species, and
   phylogeographic breaks in these are likewise stepped by latitude (and
   presumably history) rather than by biome. Nevertheless, high latitude
   endemism and the antiquity of these lineages point to an extended
   presence in the region that very likely predates the Pleistocene.}},

   major factor contributing to the evolution of senescence (Ljubuncic \&

   Williams' criteria remain rare, in both humans and other animals (e.g.
   Alexander et al. 2007; Kulminski et al. 2010). An intriguing example in

Abstract = {{Species are impacted by climate change at both ecological and
   evolutionary time scales. Studies in northern continents have provided
   abundant evidence of dramatic shifts in distributions of species
   subsequent to the last glacial maximum (LGM), particularly at high
   latitudes. However, little is known about the history of southern
   continents, especially at high latitudes. South America is the only
   continent, other than Antarctica, that extends beyond 40 degrees S.
   Genetic studies of a few Patagonian species have provided seemingly
   conflicting results, indicating either postglacial colonization from
   restricted glacial refugia or persistence through glacial cycles and in
   situ differentiation. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences of 14 species of
   sigmodontine rodents, a major faunal ensemble of Patagonia and Tierra
   del Fuego, we show that at least nine of these species bear genetic
   footprints of demographic expansion from single restricted sources.
   However, timing of demographic expansion precedes the LGM in most of
   these species. Four species are fragmented phylogeographically within
   the region. Our results indicate that (i) demographic instability in
   response to historical climate change has been widespread in the
   Patagonian-Fueguian region, and is generally more pronounced at high
   latitudes in both southern and northern continents; (ii) colonization
   from lower latitudes is an important component of current
   Patagonian-Fueguian diversity; but (iii) in situ differentiation has
   also contributed to species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic data are often used to assess `population connectivity' because
   it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales.
   Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number
   of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity
   depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of
   dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of
   residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on
   genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on
   demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is
   clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable
   or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise,
   the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on
   the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high
   dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore,
   it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without
   information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over
   time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity
   when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement
   behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and
   residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic
   measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic
   connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest:
   inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity.
   To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population
   connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with
   capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to
   elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations.}},

Title = {{Complete separation along matrilines in a social spider metapopulation

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3052-3063}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and quantity of genetic diversity may be profoundly
   influenced by the emergence and dynamics of social groups. Permanent
   social living in spiders has resulted in the subdivision of their
   populations in more or less isolated colony lineages that grow,
   proliferate and become extinct without mixing with one another. A newly
   discovered hypervariable mitochondrial DNA region allowed us to examine
   the fine scale metapopulation structure in the social Anelosimus
   eximius. We sampled 39 colonies in Ecuador and French Guiana and
   identified 25 haplotypes. The majority of colonies contained one
   haplotype. Additional haplotypes occurred in approximately 15\% of the
   colonies, and were always closely related to the common colony
   haplotype. Our findings confirm that colonies consist of single
   matrilines, with within-colony variation explained by mutations within
   the matriline. We thus found no evidence of mixing of matrilines.
   Likewise, colonies in a cluster often shared a haplotype, implying
   common colony ancestry. In few cases, however, haplotypes were shared
   between more distant colonies, providing evidence for occasional longer
   distance dispersal and/or widespread colony lineages. The geographical
   localities of colonies were incongruent with phylogenetic trees and
   haplotype networks, showing that some areas contained two or more
   matrilines. Hence, females do not migrate into foreign colonies, but
   faithfully remain within their own colony lineage, even when they
   disperse into new areas. These results indicate that the fine scale
   metapopulation structure of pure matrilines is maintained over the long
   term and that colony turnover is not extensive or radical enough to
   homogenize entire geographical areas. Genetic diversity is thus
   preserved to some extent at the metapopulation level.}},

Title = {{MHC heterozygosity and survival in red junglefowl}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) form a vital part of
   the vertebrate immune system and play a major role in pathogen
   resistance. The extremely high levels of polymorphism observed at the
   MHC are hypothesised to be driven by pathogen-mediated selection.
   Although the exact nature of selection remains unclear, three main
   hypotheses have been put forward; heterozygote advantage, negative
   frequency-dependence and fluctuating selection. Here, we report the
   effects of MHC genotype on survival in a cohort of semi-natural red
   junglefowl (Gallus gallus) that suffered severe mortality as a result of
   an outbreak of the disease coccidiosis. The cohort was followed from
   hatching until 250 days of age, approximately the age of sexual maturity
   in this species, during which time over 80\% of the birds died. We show
   that on average birds with MHC heterozygote genotypes survived infection
   longer than homozygotes and that this effect was independent of
   genome-wide heterozygosity, estimated across microsatellite loci. This
   MHC effect appeared to be caused by a single susceptible haplotype
   (CD\_c) the effect of which was masked in all heterozygote genotypes by
   other dominant haplotypes. The CD\_c homozygous genotype had lower
   survival than all other genotypes, but CD\_c heterozygous genotypes had
   survival probabilities equal to the most resistant homozygote genotype.
   Importantly, no heterozygotes conferred greater resistance than the most
   resistant homozygote genotype, indicating that the observed survival
   advantage of MHC heterozygotes was the product of dominant, rather than
   overdominant processes. This pattern and effect of MHC diversity in our
   population could reflect the processes ongoing in similarly small,
   fragmented natural populations.}},

Title = {{Does local adaptation to resources explain genetic differentiation among
   Daphnia populations?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3076-3087}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Substantial genetic differentiation is frequently observed among
   populations of cyclically parthenogenetic zooplankton despite their high
   dispersal capabilities and potential for gene flow. Local adaptation has
   been invoked to explain population genetic differentiation despite high
   dispersal, but several neutral models that account for basic life
   history features also predict high genetic differentiation. Here, we
   study genetic differentiation among four populations of Daphnia pulex in
   east central Illinois. As with other studies of Daphnia, we demonstrate
   substantial population genetic differentiation despite close geographic
   proximity (< 50 km; mean theta = 0.22). However, we explicitly tested
   and failed to find evidence for, the hypothesis that local adaptation to
   food resources occurs in these populations. Recognizing that local
   adaptation can occur in traits unrelated to resources, we estimated
   contemporary migration rates (m) and tested for admixture to evaluate
   the hypothesis that observed genetic differentiation is consistent with
   local adaptation to other untested ecological factors. Using Bayesian
   assignment methods, we detected migrants in three of the four study
   populations including substantial evidence for successful reproduction
   by immigrants in one pond, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that
   local adaptation limits gene flow for at least this population. Thus, we
   suggest that local adaptation does not explain genetic differentiation
   among these Daphnia populations and that other factors related to
   extinction/colonization dynamics, a long approach to equilibrium F(ST)
   or substantial genetic drift due to a low number of individuals hatching
   from the egg bank each season may explain genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, have
   declined, but neither the causes nor the magnitude are fully understood.
   In order to evaluate historic demography, variation at 12 microsatellite
   DNA loci surveyed in 1218 L. polyphemus sampled from 28 localities was
   analysed with Bayesian coalescent-based methods. The analysis showed
   strong declines in population sizes throughout the species' distribution
   except in the geographically isolated southern-most population in
   Mexico, where a strong increase in population size was inferred.
   Analyses suggested that demographic changes in the core of the
   distribution occurred in association with the recolonization after the
   Ice Age and also by anthropogenic effects, such as the past overharvest
   of the species for fertilizer or the current use of the animals as bait
   for American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and whelk (Busycon spp.) fisheries.
   This study highlights the importance of considering both climatic
   changes and anthropogenic effects in efforts to understand population
   dynamics-a topic which is highly relevant in the ongoing assessments of
   the effects of climate change and overharvest.}},

Abstract = {{For mammals with a polygynous mating system, dispersal is expected to be
   male-biased. However, with the increase in empirical studies,
   discrepancies are arising between the expected and observed
   direction/extent of the bias in dispersal. In this study, we assessed
   sex-biased dispersal in red deer (Cervus elaphus) on 13 estates from the
   Scottish Highlands. A total of 568 adult individuals were genotyped at
   21 microsatellite markers and sequenced for 821 bp of the mitochondrial
   control region. Estimates of population structure with mitochondrial
   sequences were eight times larger than that obtained with microsatellite
   data (F(st'-mtDNA) = 0.831; F(st'-micros) = 0.096) indicating overall
   male-biased dispersal in the study area. Comparisons of microsatellite
   data between the sexes indicated a predominance of male-biased dispersal
   in the study area but values of F(ST) and relatedness were only slighter
   larger for females. Individual-based spatial autocorrelation analysis
   generated a similar pattern of relatedness across geographical distances
   for both sexes, with differences only significant at two distance
   intervals (25-30 and 70-112 km). Patterns of relatedness differed
   between estates, male biased-dispersal was detected in eight estates but
   no sex-biased dispersal was found in the remaining five. Neither
   population density nor landscape cover was found to be associated with

Abstract = {{Adult height is a risk factor in numerous human cancers that involve
   aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling. However, its
   importance is debated due to conflicting epidemiological studies and the
   lack of useful in vivo models. In Xiphophorus fishes
   (Platyfishes/Swordtails), a functional RTK, Xiphophorus melanoma
   receptor kinase (Xmrk), serves as the dominant oncogene and has been
   maintained for several million years despite being deleterious and in an
   extremely unstable genomic region. Here we show that the Xmrk genotype
   is positively correlated with standard length in male and female wild
   caught Xiphophorus cortezi sampled throughout their phylogeographic
   distribution. Histopathology confirms the occurrence of malignant
   melanomas in both sexes; however, melanoma incidence was extremely male
   biased. Furthermore, males collected with malignant melanomas in the
   field were significantly larger than both Xmrk males collected without
   melanomas and wildtype (Xmrk deficient) males. These results not only
   provide a novel selective mechanism for the persistence of the germline
   Xmrk oncogene but also create an innovative avenue of melanoma research
   within the Xiphophorus fishes. Wildlife cancer in natural systems is a
   growing concern, therefore, future research investigating life history
   characteristics associated with certain phenotypes and genotypes that
   predispose an individual to cancer will be fundamental to increasing our
   understanding of the evolutionary biology of cancer in nature as well as
   in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome rearrangements may affect the rate and patterns of gene flow
   within species, through reduced fitness of structural heterozygotes or
   by reducing recombination rates in rearranged areas of the genome. While
   the effects of chromosome rearrangements on gene flow have been studied
   in a wide range of organisms with monocentric chromosomes, the effects
   of rearrangements in holocentric chromosomes-chromosomes in which
   centromeric activity is distributed along the length of the
   chromosome-have not. We collected chromosome number and molecular
   genetic data in Carex scoparia, an eastern North American plant species
   with holocentric chromosomes and highly variable karyotype (2n = 56-70).
   There are no deep genetic breaks within C. scoparia that would suggest
   cryptic species differentiation. However, genetic distance between
   individuals is positively correlated with chromosome number difference
   and geographic distance. A positive correlation is also found between
   chromosome number and genetic distance in the western North American C.
   pachystachya (2n = 74-81). These findings suggest that geographic
   distance and the number of karyotype rearrangements separating
   populations affect the rate of gene flow between those populations. This
   is the first study to quantify the effects of holocentric chromosome
   rearrangements on the partitioning of intraspecific genetic variance.}},

   plants demonstrates that East Africa is a hotspot for the evolution and

Abstract = {{Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV, genus Potyvirus) is globally
   the most common pathogen of cultivated sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas;
   Convolvulaceae). Although more than 150 SPFMV isolates have been
   sequence-characterized from cultivated sweet potatos across the world,
   little is known about SPFMV isolates from wild hosts and the
   evolutionary forces shaping SPFMV population structures. In this study,
   46 SPFMV isolates from 14 wild species of genera Ipomoea, Hewittia and
   Lepistemon (barcoded for the matK gene in this study) and 13 isolates
   from cultivated sweet potatoes were partially sequenced. Wild plants
   were infected with the EA, C or O strain, or co-infected with the EA and
   C strains of SPFMV. In East Africa, SPFMV populations in wild species
   and sweet potato were genetically undifferentiated, suggesting
   inter-host transmission of SPFMV. Globally, spatial diversification of
   the 178 isolates analysed was observed, strain EA being largely
   geographically restricted to East Africa. Recombination was frequently
   detected in the 6K2-VPg-NIaPro region of the EA strain, demonstrating a
   recombination `hotspot'. Recombination between strains EA and C was
   rare, despite their frequent co-infections in wild plants, suggesting
   purifying selection against strain EA/C recombinants. Positive selection
   was predicted on 17 amino acids distributed over the entire coat protein
   in the globally distributed strain C, as compared to only four amino
   acids in the coat protein N-terminus of the EA strain. This selection
   implies a more recent introduction of the C strain and a higher
   adaptation of the EA strain to the local ecosystem. Thus, East Africa
   appears as a hotspot for evolution and diversification of SPFMV.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Historical records suggest that the petrels of Round Island (near
   Mauritius, Indian Ocean) represent a recent, long-distance colonization
   by species originating from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The
   majority of petrels on Round Island appear most similar to Pterodroma
   arminjoniana, a species whose only other breeding locality is Trindade
   Island in the South Atlantic. Using nine microsatellite loci, patterns
   of genetic differentiation in petrels from Round and Trindade Islands
   were analysed. The two populations exhibit low but significant levels of
   differentiation in allele frequencies and estimates of migration rate
   between islands using genetic data are also low, supporting the
   hypothesis that these populations have recently separated but are now
   isolated from one another. A second population of petrels, most similar
   in appearance to the Pacific species P. neglecta, is also present on
   Round Island and observations suggest that the two petrel species are
   hybridizing. Vocalizations recorded on the island also suggest that
   hybrid birds may be present within the population. Data from
   microsatellite genotypes support this hypothesis and indicate that there
   may have been many generations of hybridization and back-crossing
   between P. arminjoniana and P. neglecta on Round Island. Our results
   provide an insight into the processes of dispersal and the consequences
   of secondary contact in Procellariiformes.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{15}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Studies of hybridization have increased our understanding of the nature
   of species boundaries, the process of speciation, and the effects of
   hybridization on the evolution of populations and species. In the
   present study we use genetic and morphological data to determine the
   outcome and consequences of secondary contact and hybridization between
   the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa in the Rocky
   Mountains. Admixture proportions estimated from structure and
   geographical cline analysis indicate L. idas and L. melissa have
   hybridized extensively in the Rocky Mountains and that reproductive
   isolation was insufficient to prevent introgression for much of the
   genome. Geographical patterns of admixture suggest that hybridization
   between L. idas and L. melissa has led to the formation of a hybrid
   zone. The hybrid zone is relatively wide, given estimates of dispersal
   for Lycaeides butterflies, and does not show strong evidence of cline
   concordance among characters. We believe the structure of the Lycaeides
   hybrid zone might be best explained by the patchy distribution of
   Lycaeides, local extinction and colonization of habitat patches,
   environmental variation and weak overall selection against hybrids. We
   found no evidence that hybridization in the Rocky Mountains has resulted
   in the formation of independent hybrid species, in contrast to the
   outcome of hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa in the Sierra
   Nevada. Finally, our results suggest that differences in male morphology
   between L. idas and L. melissa might contribute to isolation, or perhaps
   even that selection has favoured the spread of L. melissa male genitalia
   alleles.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive success and its determinants are difficult to infer for
   wild populations of species with no parental care where behavioural
   observations are difficult or impossible. In this study, we
   characterized the breeding system and provide estimates of individual
   reproductive success under natural conditions for an exhaustively
   sampled stream-resident brown trout (Salmo trutta) population. We
   inferred parentage using a full probability Bayesian model that combines
   genetic (microsatellite) with phenotypic data. By augmenting the
   potential parents file with inferred parental genotypes from sib-ship
   analysis in cases where large families had unsampled parents, we could
   make more precise inference on variance of family size. We observed both
   polygamous and monogamous matings and large reproductive skew for both
   sexes, particularly in males. Correspondingly, we found evidence for
   sexual selection on body size for both sexes. We show that the mating
   system of brown trout has the potential to be very flexible and we
   conjecture that environmental uncertainty could be driving the evolution
   and perhaps select for the maintenance of plasticity of the mating
   system in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic range differences among species may result from differences
   in their physiological tolerances. In the intertidal zone, marine and
   terrestrial environments intersect to create a unique habitat, across
   which physiological tolerance strongly influences range. Traits to cope
   with environmental extremes are particularly important here because many
   species live near their physiological limits and environmental gradients
   can be steep. The snail Melampus bidentatus occurs in coastal salt
   marshes in the western Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. We used sequence
   data from one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear markers (histone H3
   and a mitochondrial carrier protein, MCP) to identify three cryptic
   species within this broad-ranging nominal species, two of which have
   partially overlapping geographic ranges. High genetic diversity, low
   population structure, and high levels of migration within these two
   overlapping species suggest that historical range limitations do not
   entirely explain their different ranges. To identify microhabitat
   differences between these two species, we modelled their distributions
   using data from both marine and terrestrial environments. Although
   temperature was the largest factor setting range limits, other
   environmental components explained features of the ranges that
   temperature alone could not. In particular, the interaction of
   precipitation and salinity likely sets physiological limits that lead to
   range differences between these two cryptic species. This suggests that
   the response to climatic change in these snails will be mediated by
   changes to multiple environmental factors, and not just to temperature
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial orchid germination, growth and development are closely
   linked to the establishment and maintenance of a relationship with a
   mycorrhizal fungus. Mycorrhizal dependency and specificity varies
   considerably between orchid taxa but the degree to which this underpins
   rarity in orchids is unknown. In the context of examining orchid rarity,
   large scale in vitro and in situ germination trials complemented by DNA
   sequencing were used to investigate ecological specialization in the
   mycorrhizal interaction of the rare terrestrial orchid Caladenia
   huegelii. Common and widespread sympatric orchid congeners were used for
   comparative purposes. Germination trials revealed an absolute
   requirement for mycorrhisation with compatibility barriers to
   germination limiting C. huegelii to a highly specific and range limited,
   efficacious mycorrhizal fungus. DNA sequencing confirmed fidelity
   between orchid and fungus across the distribution range of C. huegelii
   and at key life history stages within its life cycle. It was also
   revealed that common congeners could swap or share fungal partners
   including the fungus associated with the rare orchid but not vice versa.
   Data from this study provides evidence for orchid rarity as a cause and
   consequence of high mycorrhizal specialization. This interaction must be
   taken into account in efforts to mitigate the significant extinction
   risk for this species from anthropogenically induced habitat change and
   illustrates the importance of understanding fungal specificity in orchid
   ecology and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Examining the targets of selection in crop species and their wild and
   weedy relatives sheds light on the evolutionary processes underlying
   differentiation of cultivars from progenitor lineages. On one hand,
   human-mediated directional selection in crops favours traits associated
   with the streamlining of controllable and predictable monoculture
   practices alongside selection for desired trait values. On the other
   hand, natural selection in wild and especially weedy relatives
   presumably favours trait values that increase the probability of
   escaping eradication. Gene flow between crops and wild species may also
   counter human-mediated selection, promoting the evolution and
   persistence of weedy forms. In this issue, two studies from a group of
   collaborators examine diversity and divergence patterns of genes
   underlying two traits associated with red rice (Oryza sp.), the
   conspecific relative of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) that is a
   non-native weed (see Fig. 1). In the first study by Gross et al. (2010),
   genetic variation in the major gene underlying the hallmark red
   pigmentation characterizing most weedy rice (Rc) is found to have a
   pattern consistent with non-reversion from U.S. cultivated rice (i.e.
   the cultivar did not `go feral'). This suggests that U.S. weedy rice is
   not an escaped lineage derived from U.S. cultivated rice populations;
   weedy rice likely differentiated prior to the selective sweep occurred
   in this gene within cultivated rice populations. Using the major seed
   shattering locus sh4 gene and the neighbouring genomic region, Thurber
   et al. (2010) track the molecular evolutionary history of the high
   shattering phenotype, a trait contributing dramatically to the success
   of crop selection in cultivated rice as well as the persistence and
   expansion of weedy red rice. In this study, the shared fixation of a sh4
   mutation in both cultivated rice and weedy rice indicates that weedy
   rice arose subsequent to the strong selective sweep leading to
   significant reduction in seed shattering in cultivated rice.}},

Abstract = {{Lizards have been model organisms for ecological and evolutionary
   studies from individual to community levels at multiple spatial and
   temporal scales. Here we highlight lizards as models for phylogeographic
   studies, review the published population genetics/phylogeography
   literature to summarize general patterns and trends and describe some
   studies that have contributed to conceptual advances. Our review
   includes 426 references and 452 case studies: this literature reflects a
   general trend of exponential growth associated with the theoretical and
   empirical expansions of the discipline. We describe recent lizard
   studies that have contributed to advances in understanding of several
   aspects of phylogeography, emphasize some linkages between
   phylogeography and speciation and suggest ways to expand phylogeographic
   studies to test alternative pattern-based modes of speciation.
   Allopatric speciation patterns can be tested by phylogeographic
   approaches if these are designed to discriminate among four alternatives
   based on the role of selection in driving divergence between
   populations, including: (i) passive divergence by genetic drift; (ii)
   adaptive divergence by natural selection (niche conservatism or
   ecological speciation); and (iii) socially-mediated speciation. Here we
   propose an expanded approach to compare patterns of variation in
   phylogeographic data sets that, when coupled with morphological and
   environmental data, can be used to to discriminate among these
   alternative speciation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivated rice fields worldwide are plagued with weedy rice, a
   conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). The persistence
   of weedy rice has been attributed, in part, to its ability to shatter
   (disperse) seed prior to crop harvesting. In the United States,
   separately evolved weedy rice groups have been shown to share genomic
   identity with exotic domesticated cultivars. Here, we investigate the
   shattering phenotype in a collection of U.S. weedy rice accessions, as
   well as wild and cultivated relatives. We find that all U.S. weedy rice
   groups shatter seeds easily, despite multiple origins, and in contrast
   to a decrease in shattering ability seen in cultivated groups. We
   assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus,
   sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice,
   regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all
   contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed
   shattering. Our data constitute the strongest evidence to date of an
   evolution of weeds from domesticated backgrounds. The combination of a
   shared cultivar sh4 allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests
   that U.S. weedy rice have re-acquired the shattering trait after
   divergence from their progenitors through alternative genetic
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Colour polymorphisms have fascinated evolutionary ecologists for a long
   time. Yet, knowledge on the mechanisms that allow their persistence is
   restricted to a handful of well-studied cases. We studied two species of
   Lake Victoria cichlid fish, Neochromis omnicaeruleus and Neochromis
   greenwoodi, exhibiting very similar sex-linked colour polymorphisms. The
   ecology and behaviour of one of these species is well studied, with
   colour-based mating and aggression preferences. Here, we ask whether the
   selection potentially resulting from female and male mating preferences
   and aggression biases reduces gene flow between the colour morphs and
   permits differentiation in traits other than colour. Over the past 14
   years, the frequencies of colour morphs have somewhat oscillated, but
   there is no evidence for directional change, suggesting the colour
   polymorphism is persistent on an ecological timescale. We find limited
   evidence of eco-morphological differentiation between sympatric
   ancestral (plain) and derived (blotched) colour morphs. We also find
   significantly nonrandom genotypic assignment and an excess of linkage
   disequilibrium in the plain morph, which together with previous
   information on mating preferences suggests nonrandom mating between
   colour morphs. This, together with negative frequency-dependent sexual
   selection, found in previous studies, may facilitate maintenance of
   these polymorphisms in sympatry.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the influence of the landscape on the genetic structure of
   natural populations remains an important empirical challenge,
   particularly for poorly studied, ecologically cryptic species. We
   conducted an extensive microsatellite analysis to examine the population
   genetics of the southern long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum
   sigillatum) in a naturally complex landscape. Using spatially explicit
   modelling, we investigated the influence of the Sierra Nevada topography
   on potential dispersal corridors between sampled populations. Our
   results indicate very high-genetic divergence among populations, high
   within-deme relatedness, and little evidence of recent migration or
   population admixture. We also discovered unexpectedly high between-year
   genetic differentiation (F(ST)) for breeding sites, suggesting that
   breeding groups vary over localized space and time. While environmental
   factors associated with high-elevation montane habitats apparently play
   an important role in shaping population differentiation, additional,
   species-specific biological processes must also be operating to account
   for observed deviations from temporal, among-year panmixia. Our study
   emphasizes the population-level insights that can be gained from
   high-density sampling in space and time, and the highly substructured
   population biology that may characterize amphibians in extreme montane
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and its genetic consequences are a critically
   important issue in evaluating the evolutionary penalties of human
   habitat modification. Here, we examine the genetic structure and
   diversity in naturally subdivided and artificially fragmented
   populations of the endangered tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi),
   a small fish restricted to discrete coastal lagoons and estuaries in
   California, USA. We use five naturally fragmented coastal populations
   from a 300- km spatial scale as a standard to assess migration and drift
   relative to eight artificially fragmented bay populations from a 30- km
   spatial scale. Using nine microsatellite loci in 621 individuals, and a
   522-base fragment of mitochondrial DNA control region from 103
   individuals, we found striking differences in the relative influences of
   migration and drift on genetic variation at these two scales. Overall,
   the artificially fragmented populations exhibited a consistent pattern
   of higher genetic differentiation and significantly lower genetic
   diversity relative to the naturally fragmented populations. Thus, even
   in a species characterized by habitat isolation and subdivision, further
   artificial fragmentation appears to result in substantial population
   genetic consequences and may not be sustainable.}},

Title = {{Cattle ancestry in bison: explanations for higher mtDNA than autosomal
   ancestry}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3328-3335}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Understanding and documenting the process of hybridization and
   introgression between related species is a major focus of recent
   evolutionary research using molecular techniques. Many North American
   bison herds have cattle ancestry introduced by crossbreeding over a
   century ago. Molecular estimates of this ancestry have shown much higher
   levels for cattle mtDNA than for autosomal cattle genes. A large part of
   this difference appears to be the result of partial reproductive
   isolation between the two species where only bison bull x domestic cow
   crosses are successful, and all the surviving progeny are females. In
   addition, selection against autosomal cattle genes in bison may have
   contributed to differential levels of cattle ancestry. The impact of
   selection against cattle mtDNA and gene flow of bison mtDNA are examined
   to explain particular combinations of mtDNA and autosomal cattle
   ancestry. A bottleneck, after the level of cattle ancestry in bison was
   reduced to a low level, is consistent with the high variance over
   autosomal loci observed for cattle ancestry, and differential selection
   among cattle loci in bison does not need to be invoked. Further
   examination of the cattle genome in bison may shed light on whether
   these markers, or their associated regions, are indeed neutral.}},

Title = {{Genetic evidence for high propagule pressure and long-distance dispersal

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a successful invasive species
   that does not exhibit life history traits typically associated with
   colonizing species (e.g., high reproductive rate or long-distance
   dispersal capacity). To investigate this apparent paradox, we examined
   individual and population genetic patterns of microsatellite loci at one
   native and two invasive sites. More specifically, we aimed at evaluating
   the role of propagule pressure, sexual monogamy and long-distance
   dispersal in monk parakeet invasion success. Our results indicate little
   loss of genetic variation at invasive sites relative to the native site.
   We also found strong evidence for sexual monogamy from patterns of
   relatedness within sites, and no definite cases of extra-pair paternity
   in either the native site sample or the examined invasive site. Taken
   together, these patterns directly and indirectly suggest that high
   propagule pressure has contributed to monk parakeet invasion success. In
   addition, we found evidence for frequent long-distance dispersal at an
   invasive site (similar to 100 km) that sharply contrasted with previous
   estimates of smaller dispersal distance made in the native range
   (similar to 2 km), suggesting long-range dispersal also contributes to
   the species' spread within the United States. Overall, these results add
   to a growing body of literature pointing to the important role of
   propagule pressure in determining, and thus predicting, invasion
   success, especially for species whose life history traits are not
   typically associated with invasiveness.}},

Title = {{Genetic differentiation across the social transition in a socially

Number = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Eusociality is widely considered a major evolutionary transition. The
   socially polymorphic sweat bee Halictus rubicundus, solitary in cooler
   regions of its Holarctic range and eusocial in warmer parts, is an
   excellent model organism to address this transition, and specifically
   the question of whether sociality is associated with a strong barrier to
   gene flow between phenotypically divergent populations. Mitochondrial
   DNA (COI) from specimens collected across the British Isles, where both
   solitary and social phenotypes are represented, displayed limited
   variation, but placed all specimens in the same European lineage;
   haplotype network analysis failed to differentiate solitary and social
   lineages. Microsatellite genetic variability was high and enabled us to
   quantify genetic differentiation among populations and social phenotypes
   across Great Britain and Ireland. Results from conceptually different
   analyses consistently showed greater genetic differentiation between
   geographically distant populations, independently of their social
   phenotype, suggesting that the two social forms are not reproductively
   isolated. A landscape genetic approach revealed significant isolation by
   distance (Mantel test r = 0.622, P < 0.001). The Irish Sea acts as
   physical barrier to gene flow (partial Mantel test r = 0.453, P < 0.01),
   indicating that geography, rather than expression of solitary or social
   behaviour (partial Mantel test r = -0.238, P = 0.053), had a significant
   effect on the genetic structure of H. rubicundus across the British
   Isles. Although we cannot reject the hypothesis of a genetic
   underpinning to differences in solitary and eusocial phenotypes, our
   data clearly demonstrate a lack of reproductive isolation between the
   two social forms.}},

Abstract = {{A. halleri is a psuedometallophyte with a patchy distribution in Europe
   and is often spread by human activity. To determine the population
   history and whether this history is consistent with potential human
   effects, we surveyed nucleotide variation using 24 loci from 12
   individuals in a large A. halleri population. The means of total and
   silent nucleotide variation (theta(W)) are within the range expected for
   the species. The population genetic neutrality tests Tajima's D and
   Wall's B had significant composite results rejecting panmixia, and
   Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis revealed that a subdivision
   model better explained the variation than the standard neutral model,
   refugia (or admixture), bottleneck or change of population size models.
   A categorical regression analysis further supports the subdivision
   model, and under the subdivision model, the neutrality tests are no
   longer significant. The best support was for two source populations, a
   situation consistent with the mixing of two populations possibly
   mediated by human activity. This scenario might limit the genetic
   diversity and adaptive potential of the population. The non-neutral
   population variation described here should be considered in
   bioinformatic searches for adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Weedy forms of crop species infest agricultural fields worldwide and are
   a leading cause of crop losses, yet little is known about how these
   weeds evolve. Red rice (Oryza sativa), a major weed of cultivated rice
   fields in the US, is recognized by the dark-pigmented grain that gives
   it its common name. Studies using neutral molecular markers have
   indicated a close relationship between US red rice and domesticated
   rice, suggesting that the weed may have originated through reversion of
   domesticated rice to a feral form. We have tested this reversion
   hypothesis by examining molecular variation at Rc, the regulatory gene
   responsible for grain pigmentation differences between domesticated and
   wild rice. Loss-of-function mutations at Rc account for the absence of
   proanthocyanidin pigments in cultivated rice grains, and the major rc
   domestication allele has been shown to be capable of spontaneous
   reversion to a functional form through additional mutations at the Rc
   locus. Using a diverse sample of 156 weedy, domesticated and wild
   Oryzas, we analysed DNA sequence variation at Rc and its surrounding 4
   Mb genomic region. We find that reversion of domestication alleles does
   not account for the pigmented grains of weed accessions; moreover, we
   find that haplotypes characterizing the weed are either absent or very
   rare in cultivated rice. Sequences from genomic regions flanking Rc are
   consistent with a genomic footprint of the rc selective sweep in
   cultivated rice, and they are compatible with a close relationship of
   red rice to Asian Oryzas that have never been cultivated in the US.}},

Abstract = {{Revealing the genetic basis of reproductive isolation is fundamental for
   understanding the speciation process. Chromosome speciation models
   propose a role for chromosomal rearrangements in promoting the build up
   of reproductive isolation between diverging populations and empirical
   data from several animal and plant taxa support these models. The pied
   flycatcher and the collared flycatcher are two closely related species
   that probably evolved reproductive isolation during geographical
   separation in Pleistocene glaciation refugia. Despite the short
   divergence time and current hybridization, these two species demonstrate
   a high degree of intrinsic post-zygotic isolation and previous studies
   have shown that traits involved in mate choice and hybrid viability map
   to the Z-chromosome. Could rearrangements of the Z-chromosome between
   the species explain their reproductive isolation? We developed high
   coverage Z-chromosome linkage maps for both species, using gene-based
   markers and large-scale SNP genotyping. Best order maps contained 57-62
   gene markers with an estimated average density of one every 1-1.5 Mb. We
   estimated the recombination rates in flycatcher Z-chromosomes to 1.1-1.3
   cM/Mb. A comparison of the maps of the two species revealed extensive
   co-linearity with no strong evidence for chromosomal rearrangements.
   This study does therefore not provide support the idea that sex
   chromosome rearrangements have caused the relatively strong post-zygotic
   reproductive isolation between these two Ficedula species.}},

Abstract = {{Historical drainage patterns adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
   differed markedly from those of today. We examined the relationship
   between drainage history and geographic patterns of genetic variation in
   the Yunnan spiny frog, Nanorana yunnanensis, using approximately 981
   base pairs of mitochondrial DNA partial sequences from protein-coding
   genes ND1 and ND2, and intervening areas including complete tRNAIle,
   tRNAGln and tRNAMet. Two null hypotheses were tested: (i) that genetic
   patterns do not correspond to the development of drainage systems and
   (ii) that populations had been stable and not experienced population
   expansion, bottlenecking and selection. Genealogical analyses identified
   three, major, well-supported maternal lineages, each of which had two
   sublineages. These divergent lineages were completely concordant with
   six geographical regions. Genetic structure and divergence were strongly
   congruent with historical rather than contemporary drainage patterns.
   Most lineages and sublineages were formed via population fragmentation
   during the rearrangement of paleodrainage basins in the Early Pliocene
   and Early Pleistocene. Sympatric lineages occurred only in localities at
   the boundaries of major drainages, likely reflecting secondary contact
   of previously allopatric populations. Extensive population expansion
   probably occurred early in the Middle Pleistocene accompanying dramatic
   climatic oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene climatic fluctuations had major impacts on desert biota in
   southwestern North America. During cooler and wetter periods,
   drought-adapted species were isolated into refugia, in contrast to
   expansion of their ranges during the massive aridification in the
   Holocene. Here, we use Melampodium leucanthum (Asteraceae), a species of
   the North American desert and semi-desert regions, to investigate the
   impact of major aridification in southwestern North America on
   phylogeography and evolution in a widespread and abundant
   drought-adapted plant species. The evidence for three separate
   Pleistocene refugia at different time levels suggests that this species
   responded to the Quaternary climatic oscillations in a cyclic manner. In
   the Holocene, once differentiated lineages came into secondary contact
   and intermixed, but these range expansions did not follow the eastwardly
   progressing aridification, but instead occurred independently out of
   separate Pleistocene refugia. As found in other desert biota, the
   Continental Divide has acted as a major migration barrier for M.
   leucanthum since the Pleistocene. Despite being geographically
   restricted to the eastern part of the species' distribution,
   autotetraploids in M. leucanthum originated multiple times and do not
   form a genetically cohesive group.}},

Title = {{MHC-dependent survival in a wild population: evidence for hidden genetic
   benefits gained through extra-pair fertilizations}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Females should prefer to be fertilized by males that increase the
   genetic quality of their offspring. In vertebrates, genes of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the acquired immune
   response and have been shown to affect mating preferences. They are
   therefore important candidates for the link between mate choice and
   indirect genetic benefits. Higher MHC diversity may be advantageous
   because this allows a wider range of pathogens to be detected and
   combated. Furthermore, individuals harbouring rare MHC alleles might
   better resist pathogen variants that have evolved to evade common MHC
   alleles. In the Seychelles warbler, females paired with low
   MHC-diversity males elevate the MHC diversity of their offspring to
   levels comparable to the population mean by gaining extra-pair
   fertilizations. Here, we investigate whether increased MHC diversity
   results in higher life expectancy and whether there are any additional
   benefits of extra-pair fertilizations. Our 10-year study found a
   positive association between MHC diversity and juvenile survival, but no
   additional survival advantage of extra-pair fertilizations. In addition,
   offspring with a specific allele (Ase-ua4) had a fivefold longer life
   expectancy than offspring without this allele. Consequently, the
   interacting effects of sexual selection and pathogen-mediated viability
   selection appear to be important for maintaining MHC variation in the
   Seychelles warbler. Our study supports the prediction that MHC-dependent
   extra-pair fertilizations result in genetic benefits for offspring in
   natural populations. However, such genetic benefits might be hidden and
   not necessarily apparent in the widely used fitness comparison of extra-
   and within-pair offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Co-evolution between herbivores and plants is believed to be one of the
   processes creating Earth's biodiversity. However, it is difficult to
   disentangle to what extent diversification is really driven by
   herbivores or by other historical-geographical processes like allopatric
   isolation. In the cruciferous plant Barbarea vulgaris, some Danish
   individuals are resistant to herbivory by flea beetles (Phyllotreta
   nemorum), whereas others are not. The flea beetles are, in parallel,
   either resistant or susceptible to the plants defenses. To understand
   the historical-evolutionary framework of these interactions, we tested
   how genetically divergent resistant and susceptible plants are, using
   microsatellite markers. To test whether they are reproductively fully
   compatible, resistant and susceptible plants were grown intermixed in an
   outdoor experiment, and the paternity of open-pollinated offspring was
   determined by analysis of molecular markers. Resistant and susceptible
   Danish plants were genetically strongly differentiated and produced
   significantly fewer hybrids than expected from random mating or nearest
   neighbour mating. Our results suggest that the two types belong to
   different evolutionary lineages that have been (partly) isolated at some
   time, during which genetic and reproductive divergence evolved. A
   parsimonious scenario could be that the two plant types were isolated in
   different refugia during the previous ice age, from which they migrated
   into and met in Denmark and possibly neighbouring regions. If so,
   resistance and susceptibility has for unknown reasons become associated
   with the different evolutionary lineages.}},

Abstract = {{Although malaria parasites infecting non-human primates are important
   models for human malaria, little is known of the ecology of infection by
   these parasites in the wild. We extensively sequenced cytochrome b
   (cytb) of malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) from free-living
   southeast Asian monkeys Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis. The
   two most commonly observed taxa were Plasmodium inui and Hepatocystis
   sp., but certain other sequences did not cluster closely with any
   previously sequenced species. Most of the major clades of parasites were
   found in both Macaca species, and the two most commonly occurring
   parasite infected the two Macaca species at approximately equal levels.
   However, P. inui showed evidence of genetic differentiation between the
   populations infecting the two Macaca species, suggesting limited
   movement of this parasite among hosts. Moreover, coinfection with
   Plasmodium and Hepatocystis species occurred significantly less
   frequently than expected on the basis of the rates of infection with
   either taxon alone, suggesting the possibility of competitive exclusion.
   The results revealed unexpectedly complex communities of Plasmodium and
   Hepatocystis taxa infecting wild southeast Asian monkeys. Parasite taxa
   differed with respect to both the frequency of between-host movement and
   their frequency of coinfection.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Crop-wild hybridization has been documented in many cultivated species,
   but the ecological and genetic factors that influence the likelihood or
   rate that cultivar alleles will introgress into wild populations are
   poorly understood. Seed predation is one factor that could mitigate the
   spread of otherwise advantageous cultivar alleles into the wild by
   reducing seedling recruitment of crop-like individuals in hybrid
   populations. Seed predation has previously been linked to several seed
   characters that differ between cultivated and wild sunflower, such as
   seed size and oil content. In this study, seed morphological and
   nutritional characters were measured in a segregating population of
   sunflower crop-wild hybrids and wild and cultivated lines. Seed
   predation rates among lines were then assessed in the field. The
   relationship between seed predation and seed characters was investigated
   and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for all traits. There was
   no effect of seed type (hybrid vs. parents) on seed predation, although
   a trend toward more early predation of wild seeds was observed. Within
   the hybrids, seed predators preferred seeds that contained more oil and
   energy but were lower in fibre. The relationship between seed predation
   and oil content was supported by co-localized QTL for these traits on
   one linkage group. These results suggest that oil content may be a more
   important determinant of seed predation than seed size and provide
   molecular genetic evidence for this relationship. The cultivar allele
   was also found to increase predation at all QTL, indicating that
   post-dispersal seed predation may mitigate the spread of cultivar
   alleles into wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the importance of cross-validation ('any technique or
   instance of assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will
   generalize to an independent dataset'; Wiktionary, en.wiktionary.org) is
   one reason that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all
   investment products to carry some variation of the disclaimer, `Past
   performance is no guarantee of future results.' Even a cursory
   examination of financial behaviour, however, demonstrates that this
   warning is regularly ignored, even by those who understand what an
   independent dataset is. In the natural sciences, an analogue to
   predicting future returns for an investment strategy is predicting power
   of a particular algorithm to perform with new data. Once again, the key
   to developing an unbiased assessment of future performance is through
   testing with independent data-that is, data that were in no way involved
   in developing the method in the first place. A `gold-standard' approach
   to cross-validation is to divide the data into two parts, one used to
   develop the algorithm, the other used to test its performance. Because
   this approach substantially reduces the sample size that can be used in
   constructing the algorithm, researchers often try other variations of
   cross-validation to accomplish the same ends. As illustrated by Anderson
   in this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, however, not all attempts
   at cross-validation produce the desired result. Anderson used simulated
   data to evaluate performance of several software programs designed to
   identify subsets of loci that can be effective for assigning individuals
   to population of origin based on multilocus genetic data. Such programs
   are likely to become increasingly popular as researchers seek ways to
   streamline routine analyses by focusing on small sets of loci that
   contain most of the desired signal. Anderson found that although some of
   the programs made an attempt at cross-validation, all failed to meet the
   `gold standard' of using truly independent data and therefore produced
   overly optimistic assessments of power of the selected set of loci-a
   phenomenon known as `high grading bias.'.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The widespread utilization of molecular markers has revealed that a
   broad spectrum of taxa contain sets of morphologically cryptic, but
   genetically distinct lineages (< link rid={''}b1{''}> Bickford et al.
   2007). The identification of cryptic taxa is important as an accurate
   appreciation of diversity is crucial for a proper understanding of
   evolutionary and ecological processes. An example is the study of host
   specificity in parasitic taxa, where an apparent generalist may be found
   to contain a complex of several more specific species (< link
   rid={''}b11{''}> Smith et al. 2006). Host specificity is a key life
   history trait that varies greatly among parasites (< link
   rid={''}b9{''}> Poulin \& Keeney 2007). While some can exploit a wide
   range of hosts, others are confined to just a single species. Access to
   additional hosts increases the resources available to a parasite.
   However, physiological or ecological constraints can restrict the
   extension of host range. Furthermore, there may be a trade-off between
   relaxed specificity and performance: generalism can decrease a parasites
   ability to adapt to each individual host species, and increase exposure
   to competition from other parasites (< link rid={''}b8{''}> Poulin
   1998). Despite the central role that host specificity plays in parasite
   life history, relatively little is known about how host range is
   determined in natural systems, and data from field studies are required
   to evaluate among competing ideas. In this issue, an exciting paper by <
   link rid={''}b5{''}> Locke et al. (2010) makes a valuable contribution
   toward the understanding of host specificity in an important group of
   trematode flatworms. Using molecular methods, Locke et al. reveal an
   almost four-fold increase in the appreciated diversity of their focal
   group. In combination with a large and elegant sampling design this
   allows them to accurately assess host specificity for each taxon, and
   thus draw key insights into the factors that control host range in a
   dominant parasite group.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of genetic variation to estimate demographic and historical
   parameters and to quantitatively compare alternative scenarios recently
   gained a powerful and flexible approach: the Approximate Bayesian
   Computation (ABC). The likelihood functions does not need to be
   theoretically specified, but posterior distributions can be approximated
   by simulation even assuming very complex population models including
   both natural and human-induced processes. Prior information can be
   easily incorporated and the quality of the results can be analysed with
   rather limited additional effort. ABC is not a statistical analysis per
   se, but rather a statistical framework and any specific application is a
   sort of hybrid between a simulation and a data-analysis study. Complete
   software packages performing the necessary steps under a set of models
   and for specific genetic markers are already available, but the
   flexibility of the method is better exploited combining different
   programs. Many questions relevant in ecology can be addressed using ABC,
   but adequate amount of time should be dedicated to decide among
   alternative options and to evaluate the results. In this paper we will
   describe and critically comment on the different steps of an ABC
   analysis, analyse some of the published applications of ABC and provide

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2626-2639}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effects of altitude on the level and structure of genetic
   diversity, a genetic survey was conducted in 12 populations of sessile
   oak (Quercus petraea) located between 130 and 1660 m in two parallel
   valleys on the northern side of the Pyrenees Mountains. Genetic
   diversity was monitored at 16 nuclear microsatellite loci and 5
   chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers. The cpDNA survey suggested that extant
   populations in both valleys shared the same source populations from the
   plain. There was no visible trend of nuclear genetic diversity along
   altitude, even if indirect estimates of effective population sizes
   revealed a consistent reduction at higher altitudes. Population
   differentiation, although low, was mostly present among populations of
   the same valleys and reached similar levels than differentiation across
   the range of distribution of sessile oak. Contribution to the overall
   differentiation in the valleys was mostly due to the genetic divergence
   of the highest populations and the altitudinal variation of allelic
   frequencies at a few loci. Bayesian inference of migration between
   groups of populations showed that gene flow is preferentially
   unidirectional from lower altitudes in one valley to other groups of
   populations. Finally, we found evidence of clonal reproduction in high
   altitude populations. The introgression of Quercus robur and Quercus
   pubescens was also more frequent at the altitudinal margin suggesting
   that this mechanism may have contributed to the present migration and
   adaptation of Q. petraea and may also facilitate its future upslope
   shift in the context of climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Many plants regenerate after fire from a canopy-stored seed bank, in
   which seed are housed in fire resistant confructescences (cones) that
   remain on maternal plants. This strategy would be favoured if plants
   accumulate a sufficiently large and genetically diverse seed bank during
   interfire intervals. We use a 16-year demographic study and surveys of
   microsatellite variation to quantify and explain the rate of
   accumulation of genetic diversity within the canopy seed bank of the
   shrub Banksia spinulosa. Flowering and fruit set were highly variable.
   An initial sample in 1991 of 354 reproductively mature plants generated
   426 cones over 16 years, of which only 55 cones from 40 maternal plants
   persisted until 2005. By genotyping seed from these 55 cones we
   demonstrated that genetic diversity accumulated rapidly within the seed
   bank. Resampling revealed that diversity was determined by the number,
   not the age, of cones. Cones were widely distributed among plants,
   outcrossing rates were high (mean t(m) = 1.00 +/- 0.04) and biparental
   inbreeding low. Adults displayed little evidence of isolation by
   distance and the genotypic diversity of seed cohorts was independent of
   the density of neighbouring potential sires. We therefore estimate that
   within at least 13 individual years the number of cones produced per
   year (14-63) would have contained 100\% of the adult genetic diversity.
   We conclude that a highly outcrossed mating system and relatively
   widespread pollen dispersal ensure the rapid development of a
   genetically diverse and spatially and temporally homogeneous seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{Intercontinental trade has led to multiple introductions of invasive
   pest species at a global scale. Molecular analyses of the structure of
   populations support the understanding of ecological strategies and
   evolutionary patterns that promote successful biological invasions. The
   oriental fruit moth, Grapholita (=Cydia) molesta, is a cosmopolitan and
   economically destructive pest of stone and pome fruits, expanding its
   distribution range concomitantly with global climate warming. We used
   ten newly developed polymorphic microsatellite markers to examine the
   genetic structure of G. molesta populations in an agricultural ecosystem
   in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Larvae collected in
   eight sampling sites were assigned to a mosaic of five populations with
   significant intra-regional structure. Inferred measures of gene flow
   within populations implicated both active dispersal, and passive
   dispersal associated with accidental anthropogenic displacements. Small
   effective population sizes, coupled with high inbreeding levels,
   highlighted the effect of orchard management practices on the observed
   patterns of genetic variation within the sampling sites. Isolation by
   distance did not appear to play a major role at the spatial scale
   considered. Our results provide new insights into the population
   genetics and dynamics of an invasive pest species at a regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation genetics of bees is of particular interest because many
   bee species are in decline, so jeopardizing the essential ecosystem
   service of plant pollination that they provide. In addition, as social
   haplodiploids, inbred bees may be vulnerable to the extra genetic load
   represented by the production of sterile diploid males. Using
   microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic structure of
   populations of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus
   Morawitz) in the UK, where this species has undergone a precipitous
   decline. By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we
   also extended-and then applied-genetic methods for estimating foraging
   distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations
   were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness,
   inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence
   of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic
   bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but
   not small (10s of km) spatial scales. The minimum average effective
   population size at our sampling sites was low (c. 25). In coastal
   grassland (machair), the estimated modal foraging distance of workers
   was 391 m, with 95\% of foraging activity occurring within 955 m of the
   nest, and estimated nest density was 19.3 nests km-2. These findings
   show that B. distinguendus exhibits some genetic features of scarce,
   declining or fragmented populations. Moreover, B. distinguendus workers
   appear to forage over above-average distances and nests remain thinly
   distributed even in current strongholds. These considerations should
   inform future conservation actions for this and similar species.}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses are available to predict change in genetic diversity
   when approaching peripheral populations. We used the eastern spadefoot
   toad in Israel as a model system to examine these hypotheses using
   population genetics analyses and network theory. Our results
   contradicted most of the predictions from the `abundant centre' model,
   that edge populations should have lower density and lower genetic
   diversity than core populations. Furthermore, dispersal rate between
   core and peripheral populations is expected to be asymmetric, mostly
   directed outwards from the core population, but we did not detect such a
   trend. Our data did not support the hypothesis of no change or a
   non-linear change in genetic diversity towards the range edge. However,
   our results did fit the Fisher (The Genetical Theory of Natural
   Selection, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930) hypothesis, which predicts
   increase in genetic variability from core to edge of distribution. We
   attributed this finding to the much harsher climatic and abiotic
   conditions at the edge, which must be tolerated over generations by both
   tadpoles and post-metamorphic individuals in this region. Finally, our
   results have significant conservation implications for the survival of
   this species in Israel, where it is critically endangered. We identified
   two distinct communities, which are genetically linked through two
   specific rain pools in the Upper Galilee. Details on the spatial
   subdivision of this species are cardinal for future management and
   restoration of temporary wetlands in Israel.}},

Abstract = {{Marine invasions are taking place at an increasing rate. When occurring
   in blooms, zooplanktivorous comb jellies of the genus Mnemiopsis are
   able to cause pelagic regime shifts in coastal areas and may cause the
   collapse of commercially important fish populations. Using
   microsatellites, developed for the first time in the phylum Ctenophora,
   we show that Mnemiopsis leidyi has colonized Eurasia from two source
   regions. Our preliminary data set included four sites within the
   putative source region (US East Coast and Gulf of Mexico) and 10 invaded
   locations in Eurasian waters. Bayesian clustering and phylogeographic
   approaches revealed the origin of earlier invasions of the Black and
   Caspian Sea in the 1980s/1990s within or close to the Gulf of Mexico,
   while the 2006 invasion of the North and Baltic Seas can be directly
   traced to New England (pairwise F-ST = 0). We found no evidence for
   mixing among both gene pools in the invaded areas. While the genetic
   diversity (allelic richness) remained similar in the Baltic Sea compared
   to the source region New England, it was reduced in the North Sea,
   supporting the view of an initial invasion of Northern Europe to a
   Baltic Sea port. In Black and Caspian Sea samples, we found a gradual
   decline in allelic richness compared to the Gulf of Mexico region,
   supporting a stepping-stone model of colonization with two sequential
   genetic founder events. Our data also suggest that current practices of
   ballast water treatment are insufficient to prevent repeated invasions
   of gelatinous zooplankton.}},

Abstract = {{High specificity in the Ficus-agaonid wasp mutualism has lead to the
   assumption of a mostly `one-to-one' relationship, albeit with some
   exceptions. This view has been challenged by new molecular data in
   recent years, but surprisingly little is known about local and spatial
   genetic structuring of agaonid wasp populations. Using microsatellite
   markers, we analysed genetic structuring of Ceratosolen fusciceps, the
   fig wasp pollinating Ficus racemosa, a fig tree species widely
   distributed from India to Australia. In sampling stretching from the
   south of China to the south of Thailand we found evidence for only a
   single pollinating wasp species in continental South-East Asian
   mainland. We found no evidence for the co-occurrence of cryptic species
   within our subcontinent sampling zone. We observed no spatial genetic
   structure within sites and only limited structuring over the whole
   sampling zone, suggesting that F. racemosa is pollinated by a single
   population of a single agaonid wasp species all over continental
   South-East Asia. An additional sample of wasps collected on F. racemosa
   in Australia showed clear-cut genetic differentiation from the Asian
   continent, suggesting allopatric divergence into subspecies or species.
   We propose that the frequent local co-occurrence of sister species found
   in the literature mainly stems from contact zones between biogeographic
   regions, and that a single pollinator species over wide areas might be
   the more common situation everywhere else.}},

   microsatellite loci. The Bayesian clustering reveals that B. cucurbitae
   can be subdivided into five main groups corresponding to populations
   from (i) the African continent, (ii) La Reunion, (iii) Central Asia,
   (iv) East Asia and (v) Hawaii. The proportions of inter-regional
   assignments and the higher values of genetic diversity in populations
   from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh suggest that B. cucurbitae
   originated in Central Asia and expanded its range to East Asia and
   Hawaii on one hand and to Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean on
   the other. A number of outliers (10-19 specimens according to different
   clustering algorithms) show high levels of admixture (Q > 0.70) with
   populations from different regions and reveal complex patterns of
   inter-regional gene flow. Anthropogenic transport is the most plausible
   promoter of this large-scale dispersal. The introduction of individuals
   from geographically distant sources did not have a relevant role in the
   most recent African invasions, which originated from the expansion of
   local populations. These results could provide a useful background to
   better evaluate invasion risks and establish priorities for the
   management of this cosmopolitan agricultural pest.}},

Abstract = {{Viral strain evolution and disease emergence are influenced by
   anthropogenic change to the environment. We investigated viral
   characteristics, host ecology, and landscape features in the
   rabies-striped skunk disease system of the central Great Plains to
   determine how these factors interact to influence disease emergence. We
   amplified portions of the N and G genes of rabies viral RNA from 269
   samples extracted from striped skunk brains throughout the distribution
   of two different rabies strains for which striped skunks were the
   reservoir. Because the distribution of these two strains overlapped on
   the landscape and were present in the same host population, we could
   evaluate how viral properties influenced epidemiological patterns in the
   area of sympatry. We found that South Central Skunk rabies (SCSK)
   exhibited intense purifying selection and high infectivity, which are
   both characteristics of an epizootic virus. Conversely, North Central
   Skunk rabies (NCSK) exhibited relaxed purifying selection and
   comparatively lower infectivity, suggesting the presence of an enzootic
   virus. The host population in the area of sympatry was highly admixed,
   and skunks among allopatric and sympatric areas had similar effective
   population sizes. Spatial analysis indicated that landscape features had
   minimal influence on NCSK movement across the landscape, but those same
   features were partial barriers to the spread of SCSK. We conclude that
   NCSK and SCSK have different epidemiological properties that interact
   differently with both host and landscape features to influence rabies
   spread in the central Great Plains. We suggest a holistic approach for
   future studies of emerging infectious diseases that includes studies of
   viral properties, host characteristics, and spatial features.}},

Title = {{Is local adaptation in Mimulus guttatus caused by trade-offs at

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Local adaptation is considered to be the result of fitness trade-offs
   for particular phenotypes across different habitats. However, it is
   unclear whether such phenotypic trade-offs exist at the level of
   individual genetic loci. Local adaptation could arise from trade-offs of
   alternative alleles at individual loci or by complementary sets of loci
   with different fitness effects of alleles in one habitat but selective
   neutrality in the alternative habitat. To evaluate the genome-wide basis
   of local adaptation, we performed a field-based quantitative trait locus
   (QTL) mapping experiment on recombinant inbred lines (RILs) created from
   coastal perennial and inland annual races of the yellow monkeyflower
   (Mimulus guttatus) grown reciprocally in native parental habitats.
   Overall, we detected 19 QTLs affecting one or more of 16 traits measured
   in two environments, most of small effect. We identified 15 additional
   QTL effects at two previously identified candidate QTLs {[}DIVERGENCE
   (DIV)]. Significant QTL by environment interactions were detected at the
   DIV loci, which was largely attributable to genotypic differences at a
   single field site. We found no detectable evidence for trade-offs for
   any one component of fitness, although DIV2 showed a trade-off involving
   different fitness traits between sites, suggesting that local adaptation
   is largely controlled by non-overlapping loci. This is surprising for an
   outcrosser, implying that reduced gene flow prevents the evolution of
   individuals adapted to multiple environments. We also determined that
   native genotypes were not uniformly adaptive, possibly reflecting fixed
   mutational load in one of the populations.}},

Abstract = {{The repeated formation and loss of land-bridges during the Pleistocene
   have had lasting impacts on population genetic structure. In the
   tropics, where island populations persisted through multiple glacial
   cycles, alternating periods of isolation and contact are expected to
   have driven population and taxonomic divergence. Here, we combine
   mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data with microsatellites to dissect
   the impact of Pleistocene climate change on intra-specific
   diversification in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis. This taxon
   shows considerable morphological and acoustic variation: two parapatric
   subspecies (himalayanus and macrurus) occur on mainland China and a
   third (hainanus) on Hainan Island. Our phylogeographic reconstruction
   and coalescent analyses suggest the island subspecies formed from an
   ancestral population of himalayanus via two colonization events c. 800
   000 years before present. R. a. hainanus then recolonized the mainland,
   forming macrurus and thus a secondary contact zone with himalayanus.
   Finally, macrurus recolonized Hainan following the LGM. We found that
   all three biological events corresponded to known periods of land-bridge
   formation. Evidence of introgression was detected between macrurus and
   both its sister taxa, with geographical proximity rather than length of
   separation appearing to be the biggest determinant of subsequent genetic
   exchange. Our study highlights the important role of climate-mediated
   sea level changes have had in shaping current processes and patterns of
   population structure and taxonomic diversification.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Movements and spatial distribution of host populations are expected to
   shape the genetic structure of their parasite populations. Comparing the
   genetic patterns of both interacting species may improve our
   understanding of their evolutionary history. Moreover, genetic analyses
   of parasites with horizontal transmission may serve as indicators of
   historical events or current demographic processes that are not apparent
   in the genetic signature of their hosts. Here, we compared mitochondrial
   variation in populations of the ectoparasitic mite Spinturnix myoti with
   the genetic pattern of its host, the Maghrebian bat Myotis punicus in
   North Africa and in the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Mite
   mitochondrial differentiation among populations was correlated with both
   host mitochondrial and nuclear differentiation, suggesting spatial
   co-differentiation of the lineages of the two interacting species.
   Therefore our results suggest that parasite dispersal is exclusively
   mediated by host movements, with open water between landmasses as a main
   barrier for host and parasite dispersal. Surprisingly the unique
   presence of a continental European mite lineage in Corsica was
   inconsistent with host phylogeographical history and strongly suggests
   the former presence of European mouse-eared bats on this island.
   Parasites may thus act as biological tags to reveal the presence of
   their now locally extinct host.}},

Abstract = {{Phytochromes play a key role in allowing plants to monitor their
   surrounding environment and, conversely, adaptation to local
   environments has driven the evolutionary history of phytochromes. As a
   result of natural selection, polymorphisms in phytochrome genes would
   thus be expected to exhibit locus-specific phylogeographic structure. To
   evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a phylogeographic investigation
   based on four nuclear genes, including two phytochrome genes (PHYB and
   PHYE) using 155 samples of Arcterica nana from the entire range of the
   Japanese archipelago. Bayesian clustering revealed geographic
   differentiation between northern and southern Japan when all four genes
   were included. However, this geographic differentiation is inconsistent
   with previously reported genetic structure of genome-wide polymorphisms
   based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms, as these did not show
   geographic differentiation throughout the Japanese archipelago. In
   contrast, the north-south differentiation was not apparent when PHYE was
   excluded. This indicates that PHYE alone could be responsible for the
   north-south differentiation (F(CT) = 0.15, P < 0.001). Furthermore, a
   single nonsynonymous polymorphism (C360T) strongly contributed to
   geographic differentiation (F(CT) = 0.57, P < 0.001) and its
   corresponding amino acid replacement (P120L) was significantly under
   positive selection based on maximum likelihood analysis (P = 0.98).
   Consequently, the locus-specific geographic differentiation in PHYE
   could be caused by natural selection, suggesting the involvement of PHYE
   in local adaptation between populations of A. nana in northern and
   southern Japan. This finding is consistent with a previous study on
   Cardamine nipponica, indicating the importance of PHYE for local
   adaptation in Japanese alpine plants.}},

Abstract = {{During reproductive swarming, some workers of the Cape honey bee, Apis
   mellifera capensis, lay eggs in queen cells, many of which are reared to
   maturity. However, it is unknown if workers are able to lay in queen
   cells immediately after queen loss during an episode of emergency queen
   rearing. In this study we experimentally de-queened colonies and
   determined the maternity of larvae and pupae that were reared as queens.
   This allowed us to determine how soon after queen loss workers
   contribute to the production of new queens. We were further interested
   to see if workers would preferentially raise new queens from queen-laid
   brood if this was introduced later. We performed our manipulations in
   two different settings: an apiary setting where colonies were situated
   close together and a more natural situation in which the colonies were
   well separated. This allowed us to determine how the vicinity of other
   colonies affects the presence of parasites. We found that workers do
   indeed contribute to queen cell production immediately after the loss of
   their queen, thus demonstrating that some workers either have activated
   ovaries even when their colony has a queen or are able to activate their
   ovaries extremely rapidly. Queen-laid brood introduced days after queen
   loss was ignored, showing that workers do not prefer to raise new queens

Abstract = {{Genetic variability, kin structure and demography of a population are
   mutually dependent. Population genetic theory predicts that under
   demographically stable conditions, neutral genetic variability reaches
   equilibrium between gene flow and drift. However, density fluctuations
   and non-random mating, resulting e.g. from kin clustering, may lead to
   changes in genetic composition over time. Theoretical models also
   predict that changes in kin structure may affect aggression level and
   recruitment, leading to density fluctuations. These predictions have
   been rarely tested in natural populations. The aim of this study was to
   analyse changes in genetic variability and kin structure in a local
   population of the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) that underwent a
   fourfold change in mean density over a 6-year period. Intensive
   live-trapping resulted in sampling 88\% of individuals present in the
   study area, as estimated from mark-recapture data. Based on 642
   individual genotypes at 20 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic
   variability and kin structure of this population between consecutive
   years. We found that immigration was negatively correlated with density,
   while the number of kin groups was positively correlated with density.
   This is consistent with theoretical predictions that changes in kin
   structure play an important role in population fluctuations. Despite the
   changes in density and kin structure, there was no genetic
   differentiation between years. Population-level genetic diversity
   measures did not significantly vary in time and remained relatively high
   (H-E range: 0.72-0.78). These results show that a population that
   undergoes significant demographic and social changes may maintain high
   genetic variability and stable genetic composition.}},

Abstract = {{Diplostomoid metacercariae parasitize freshwater fishes worldwide and
   cannot be identified to species based on morphology. In this study,
   sequences of the barcode region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1)
   were used to discriminate species in 1088 diplostomoids, most of which
   were metacercariae from fish collected in the St. Lawrence River,
   Canada. Forty-seven diplostomoid species were detected, representing a
   large increase in known diversity. Most species suggested by CO1
   sequences were supported by sequences of internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) of rDNA and host and tissue specificity. Three lines of evidence
   indicate that physiological incompatibility between host and parasite is
   a more important determinant of host specificity than ecological
   separation of hosts and parasites in this important group of freshwater
   fish pathogens. First, nearly all diplostomoid species residing outside
   the lens of the eyes of fish are highly host specific, while all species
   that occur inside the lens are generalists. This can be plausibly
   explained by a physiological mechanism, namely the lack of an effective
   immune response in the lens. Second, the distribution of diplostomoid
   species among fish taxa reflected the phylogenetic relationships of host
   species rather than their ecological similarities. Third, the same
   patterns of host specificity were observed in separate, ecologically
   distinctive fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic monitoring tracks changes in measures of diversity including
   allelic richness, heterozygosity and genetic effective size over time,
   and has emerged as an important tool for understanding evolutionary
   consequences of population management. One proposed application of
   genetic monitoring has been to estimate abundance and its trajectory
   through time. Here, genetic monitoring was conducted across five
   consecutive year for the Pecos bluntnose shiner, a federally threatened
   minnow. Temporal changes in allele frequencies at seven microsatellite
   DNA loci were used to estimate variance effective size (N-eV) across
   adjacent years in the time series. Likewise, effective size was computed
   using the linkage disequilibrium method (N-eD) for each sample.
   Estimates of N-e were then compared to estimates of adult fish density
   obtained from traditional demographic monitoring. For Pecos bluntnose
   shiner, density (catch-per-unit-effort), N-eV and N-eD were positively
   associated across this time series. Results for Pecos bluntnose shiner
   were compared to a related and ecologically similar species, the Rio
   Grande silvery minnow. In this species, density and N-eV were negatively
   associated, which suggested decoupling of abundance and effective size
   trajectories. Conversely, density and N-eD were positively associated.
   For Rio Grande silvery minnow, discrepancies among estimates of N-e and
   their relationships with adult fish density could be related to effects
   of high variance in reproductive success in the wild and/or effects of
   supplementation of the wild population with captive-bred and reared
   fish. The efficacy of N-e as a predictor of density and abundance may
   depend on intrinsic population dynamics of the species and how these
   dynamics are influenced by the landscape features, management protocols
   and other factors.}},

Abstract = {{The marine midge Clunio marinus (Chironomidae, Diptera) is characterized
   by a one-dimensional distribution along the European Atlantic coast,
   where its lunar and circadian emergence rhythms are genetically adapted
   to the local tidal regimes, resulting in a series of `temporal races'.
   Clunio marinus is restricted to rocky coasts and thus the temporal races
   occur in different rocky patches. We studied 10 populations of Clunio
   marinus from five different regions, spanning the major rocky mainland
   coasts from Spain to Norway, using amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms (AFLP), microsatellites and mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase I (COI) sequences. Star-like patterns of COI haplotypes within
   regions indicate postglacial colonization. A high degree of shared
   polymorphisms in AFLP markers suggests colonization from a single
   source, implying postglacial evolution of timing adaptations in relation
   to the local tidal regime. In contrast, no COI haplotypes are shared
   among regions. We hypothesize that different levels of differentiation
   of nuclear vs. mitochondrial markers in the source region were carried
   forward during postglacial expansion. Despite the recent origin of
   populations, all markers reveal distinct genetic differentiation between
   rocky coasts on a scale of 650-1150 km. Differentiation between rocky
   coasts is not correlated to timing adaptations, suggesting that
   geographic isolation is prevalent between rocky coasts and that this
   facilitated the evolution of local timing adaptations. At the same time
   there is little genetic differentiation within rocky coasts on a scale
   of 2-6 km; leaving open the possibility that within rocky coasts with
   large variation in tidal regimes, temporal adaptations evolved in the
   face of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of Anolis cristatellus from the multiple species anole
   community of Puerto Rico in the Greater Antilles to the island of
   Dominica in the Lesser Antilles, with its solitary endemic anole,
   provides an example of a very recent, timed, single colonization. We
   investigate the geographic origin and adaptive potential of the
   Dominican population using a range of methods including mtDNA
   phylogeography, nuclear microsatellite variation and multiple paternity
   studies, as well as heritability estimates, common garden experiments
   and comparative geographic studies of quantitative scalation traits.
   Phylogeographic analysis of NADH2 and microsatellite studies suggests
   that the Dominican population arose from a set of individuals from the
   central west area of Puerto Rico within their endemic range. The
   multiple-individual inoculation, together with sperm storage and
   evidence of multiple paternity indicate genetic variability and suggest
   the potential for adaptation by natural selection. Estimates of
   heritability, common garden experiments and broad sense Q(ST)/F(ST)
   ratios, linked to replicated comparisons along elevational transects go
   some way to suggesting that the invasive populations may be adapting by
   natural selection, in parallel with the endemic anole, in the brief
   period since their introduction.}},

   European locations {[}Ebeltoft (Kattegat), Doverodde (Limfjord, Baltic
   Sea)], and one southern population from Gabicce Mare (Adriatic Sea),
   allowing to test for population specificity in the response to a
   realistic heat stress event. Eelgrass survival and growth as well as the
   expression of 12 stress associated candidate genes were assessed during
   and after the heat wave. Contrary to expectations, all populations
   suffered equally from 3 weeks of heat stress in terms of shoot loss. In
   contrast, populations markedly differed in multivariate measures of gene
   expression. While the gene expression profiles converged to pre-stress
   values directly after the heat wave, stress correlated genes were
   upregulated again 4 weeks later, in line with the observed delay in
   shoot loss. Target genes had to be selected based on functional
   knowledge in terrestrial plants, nevertheless, 10/12 genes were induced
   relative to the control treatment at least once during the heat wave in
   the fully marine plant Z. marina. This study underlines the importance
   of realistic stress and recovery scenarios in studying the impact of
   predicted climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta are two of the most commonly used
   laboratory macaques, yet their genetic differences at a genome-wide
   level remain unclear. We analysed the multilocus DNA sequence data of 54
   autosomal loci obtained from M. fascicularis samples from three
   different geographic origins and M. mulatta samples of Burmese origin.
   M. fascicularis shows high nucleotide diversity, four to five times
   higher than humans, and a strong geographic population structure between
   Indonesian-Malaysian and Philippine macaques. The pattern of divergence
   and polymorphism between M. fascicularis and M. mulatta shows a
   footprint of genetic exchange not only within their current hybrid zone
   but also across a wider range for more than 1 million years. However,
   genetic admixture may not be a random event in the genome. Whereas
   randomly selected genic and intergenic regions have the same
   evolutionary dynamics between the species, some cytochrome oxidase P450
   (CYP) genes (major chemical metabolizing genes and potential target
   genes for local adaptation) have a significantly larger species
   divergence than other genes. By surveying CYP3A5 gene sequences of more
   than a hundred macaques, we identified three nonsynonymous single
   nucleotide polymorphisms that were highly differentiated between the
   macaques. The mosaic pattern of species divergence in the genomes may be
   a consequence of genetic differentiation under ecological adaptation and
   may be a salient feature in the genomes of nascent species under
   parapatry.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation in response to
   environmental variation is fundamental as adaptation plays a key role in
   the extension of ecological niches to marginal habitats and in
   ecological speciation. Based on the assumption that some genomic markers
   are correlated to environmental variables, we aimed to detect loci of
   ecological relevance in the alpine plant Arabis alpina L. sampled in two
   regions, the French (99 locations) and the Swiss (109 locations) Alps.
   We used an unusually large genome scan {[}825 amplified fragment length
   polymorphism loci (AFLPs)] and four environmental variables related to
   temperature, precipitation and topography. We detected linkage
   disequilibrium among only 3.5\% of the considered AFLP loci. A
   population structure analysis identified no admixture in the study
   regions, and the French and Swiss Alps were differentiated and therefore
   could be considered as two independent regions. We applied generalized
   estimating equations (GEE) to detect ecologically relevant loci
   separately in the French and Swiss Alps. We identified 78 loci of
   ecological relevance (9\%), which were mainly related to mean annual
   minimum temperature. Only four of these loci were common across the
   French and Swiss Alps. Finally, we discuss that the genomic
   characterization of these ecologically relevant loci, as identified in
   this study, opens up new perspectives for studying functional ecology in
   A. alpina, its relatives and other alpine plant species.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of molecular methods, it became clear that microbial
   biodiversity had been vastly underestimated. Since then, species
   abundance patterns were determined for several environments, but
   temporal changes in species composition were not studied to the same
   level of resolution. Using massively parallel sequencing on the 454 GS
   FLX platform we identified a highly dynamic turnover of the seasonal
   abundance of protists in the Austrian lake Fuschlsee. We show that
   seasonal abundance patterns of protists closely match their
   biogeographic distribution. The stable predominance of few highly
   abundant taxa, which previously led to the suggestion of a low global
   protist species richness, is contrasted by a highly dynamic turnover of
   rare species. We suggest that differential seasonality of rare and
   abundant protist taxa explains the-so far-conflicting evidence in the
   `everything is everywhere' dispute. Consequently temporal sampling is
   basic for adequate diversity and species richness estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Although polyploidy is widespread, its significance to the generation of
   biodiversity remains unclear. Many polyploids have been derived
   recurrently. For a particular polyploid, gene-flow between the products
   of independent origin is typical where they come into contact. Here, we
   use AFLP DNA-fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA sequences to demonstrate
   parallel polyploid speciation within both of the ferns Asplenium
   cimmeriorum and A. gracillimum. Both of these taxa comprise at least two
   allopolyploids, recurrently derived from the same progenitor pair. Each
   of these allopolyploids remain genetically distinguishable even with
   extensive sympatry, and could therefore be considered distinct species.
   To our knowledge, parallel speciation on this scale amongst recurrent
   polyploids has not been previously reported. With their parallel
   origins, these `evolutionary replicates' provide an unrivalled
   opportunity to investigate how the reproductive barriers and ecological
   differentiation necessary for speciation arise following polyploidy.}},

Abstract = {{Sargassum hemiphyllum is commonly found in Japan and Korea, with a
   variety, var. chinense, that is found distributed in the southern
   Chinese coast. We previously reported distinct genetic differentiation
   between the two taxa based on the PCR-RFLP data of plastid RubiscoL-S
   spacer. The present study aims at elucidating the phylogeographic
   pattern of S. hemiphyllum based on more markers in the nuclear and
   extranuclear genomes, with a view to reveal the occurrence of
   hybridization. The two allopatrically distributed taxa were found to be
   genetically distinct in nuclear ITS2, plastidial Rubisco (Rbc) and
   mitochondrial TrnW\_I (Trn) spacers. Their divergence was postulated to
   be attributable to the vicariant event which resulted from the isolation
   of the Sea of Japan during the late Miocene (6.58-11.25 Mya). Divergence
   within both S. hemiphyllum and the chinense variety was observed based
   on Trn spacer, while the divergence in S. hemiphyllum was further
   confirmed in Rbc spacer. This divergence appears to correspond to the
   separation of the Japanese populations between the Sea of Japan and the
   Pacific that occurred around 0.92-2.88 Mya (the early Pleistocene). The
   presence of an ITS2 clone resembling var. chinense sequences in a
   Japanese population of S. hemiphyllum (JpNS) raises the possibility of
   the introgression of var. chinense individuals into S. hemiphyllum
   population. Compared to that between S. hemiphyllum and the chinense
   variety, hybridization among the Japanese and Korean populations of S.
   hemiphyllum is highly probable as all these individuals share a pool of
   nuclear ITS2 sequences, possibly attributable to incomplete concerted
   evolution of ITS2.}},

Abstract = {{Few chloroplast-based genetic studies have been undertaken for plants of
   mesic temperate forests in the southern hemisphere and fossil-based
   models have provided evidence of vegetation history only at the broadest
   scales in this region. This study investigates the chloroplast DNA
   phylogeography of Tasmannia lanceolata (Winteraceae), a fleshy-fruited,
   bird-dispersed shrub that is widespread in the mountains of southeastern
   Australia and Tasmania. Thirty haplotypes were identified after
   sequencing 3206 bp of chloroplast DNA in each of 244 individuals
   collected across the species' range. These haplotypes showed
   unexpectedly strong phylogeographic structuring, including a
   phylogeographic break within a continuous part of the species' range,
   with the distribution of four major clades mostly not overlapping, and
   geographic structuring of haplotypes within these clades. This strong
   geographic patterning of chloroplast DNA provided evidence for the
   survival of T. lanceolata in multiple putative wet forest refugia as
   well as evidence for additional wet forest species refugia in
   southeastern Australia. In western Tasmania lower haplotype diversity
   below the LGM tree line compared to above the LGM tree line suggests
   that glacial refugia at high altitudes may have been important for T.
   lanceolata. The level of geographic structuring in T. lanceolata is
   similar to gravity dispersed southern hemisphere plants such as
   Nothofagus and Eucalyptus. Behavioural traits of the birds transporting
   seed may have had a strong bearing on the limited transport of T.
   lanceolata seed, although factors limiting establishment, possibly
   including selection, may also have been important.}},

   highlights the highest microrefugia and the rapid uplift of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau}},

Abstract = {{The uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) dramatically changed the
   topography and climate of Asia and affected the biodiversity of the
   plateau and its adjacent areas. However, the effects of the uplift on
   the dispersal, differentiation and adaptation of plants remain a puzzle
   when the date and processes of the uplift cannot be determined with
   certainty and the impacts of the Quaternary glaciations on plants on the
   QTP are unknown. To clarify the relationships among plants on the QTP
   with the plateau uplift and the Quaternary glaciations, the cpDNA
   trnT-trnF regions of 891 individuals from 37 populations of Hippophae
   tibetana, endemic to the QTP, were sequenced in the present study. A
   total of 50 haplotypes were found and a strong phylogeographic structure
   was revealed (N(ST) = 0.854, G(ST) = 0.611, N(ST) > G(ST), P < 0.01).
   The results show that three main lineages of the present populations of
   H. tibetana occupy the western, the middle, and the eastern geographical
   range, respectively, and their divergence time dates back to 3.15 Ma
   before present. Of 50 haplotypes, 33 (66\%) are private haplotypes,
   which are restricted to single populations. These private haplotypes are
   scattered throughout the present geographical range of H. tibetana and
   originated from multiple differentiations in many lineages during more
   than 1.0 Ma period, strongly suggesting that multiple microrefugia of H.
   tibetana existed throughout the present geographical range during the
   last glacial maximum (LGM) and even earlier glaciations. Additionally,
   the average elevation of present populations is over 4500 m in the west
   and the equilibrium-line of glaciers in the LGM was 500-300 m lower than
   present in the major interior part of the plateau suggesting that at
   most sites in the west, LGM microrefugia of H. tibetana may have been
   above 4000 m above sea level, the highest of all known refugia.
   Moreover, the divergence times among and within the three lineages and
   their distinct distributions as well as dispersal barriers support the
   theory of the recent and rapid uplift of the QTP. The rapid uplift of
   the plateau within the last 3.4 Ma and the associated environmental
   changes may have affected the dispersal and differentiation of H
   .tibetana and shaped its phylogeographic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Multilocus studies in phylogenetics and comparative phylogeography have
   the power to explore a broader spectrum of evolutionary questions than
   either discipline has alone. To examine the origins of sympatry in a
   group of closely related birds of mostly mesic eucalypt woodlands in
   Australia, we reconstructed the relationships among species of Entomyzon
   and Melithreptus honeyeaters (Aves: Passeriformes: Meliphagidae) using a
   mitochondrial marker, ND2, and six non-coding nuclear loci (total 4719
   base pairs). By sampling across the geographical range of each species,
   we studied not only their phylogenetic relationships to each other but
   also the spatial distribution of their genetic diversity. We tested
   several biogeographic hypotheses concerning the role of Pleistocene
   environmental change in Australia. Phylogenetic gene trees support the
   current understanding of E. cyanotis as the sister to Melithreptus.
   Non-monophyly of M. lunatus in Australia's southern temperate woodlands
   highlights the need for a revision of systematics within Melithreptus.
   Phylogeographic analysis of the three northern species in Australia's
   monsoon tropics, M. gularis, M. albogularis and E. cyanotis, suggests
   that the roles of the Carpentarian and Torresian Barriers in shaping
   geographic structure in each of the species have been more complex and
   temporally dynamic than earlier morphology-based arguments of vicariance
   had suggested. We discuss their roles as ecological filters as well as
   barriers.}},

Abstract = {{The densities of conspecific individuals may vary through space,
   especially at the edge of species range. This variation in density is
   predicted to influence the diffusion of species-specific horizontally
   transmitted symbionts. However, to date there is very little data on how
   parasite prevalence varies around the border of a host species. Using a
   molecular epidemiology approach, we studied the prevalence of a
   vertically and horizontally transmitted virus at the edge of the
   geographic range of its insect host, the Drosophila parasitoid wasp
   Leptopilina boulardi. L. boulardi is a Mediterranean parasitoid species
   showing a recent range expansion to the north (in France). The LbFV
   virus manipulates the behaviour of females, increasing their tendency to
   lay additional eggs in already parasitized Drosophila larvae
   (superparasitism). This is beneficial for the virus because it allows
   the virus to be horizontally transferred during superparasitism. We show
   that LbFV prevalence is very high in central populations, intermediate
   in marginal populations and almost absent from newly established
   peripheral populations of L. boulardi. We failed to detect any influence
   of temperature and diapause on viral transmission efficiency but we
   observed a clear relationship between prevalence and parasitoid density,
   and between parasitoid density and the occurrence of superparasitism, as
   predicted by our epidemiological model. Viral strains were all efficient
   at inducing the behavioural manipulation and viral gene sequencing
   revealed very low sequence variation. We conclude that the prevalence
   reached by the virus critically depends on density-dependent factors,
   i.e. superparasitism, underlying the selective pressures acting on the
   virus to manipulate the behaviour of the parasitoid.}},

Abstract = {{Host breadth is often assumed to have no evolutionary significance in
   broad interactions because of the lack of cophylogenetic patterns
   between interacting species. Nonetheless, the breadth and suite of hosts
   utilized by one species may have adaptive value, particularly if it
   underlies a common ecological niche among hosts. Here, we present a
   preliminary assessment of the evolution of mycorrhizal specificity in 12
   closely related orchid species (genera Goodyera and Hetaeria) using
   DNA-based methods. We mapped specificity onto a plant phylogeny that we
   estimated to infer the evolutionary history of the mycorrhiza from the
   plant perspective, and hypothesized that phylogeny would explain a
   significant portion of the variance in specificity of plants on their
   host fungi. Sampled plants overwhelmingly associated with genus
   Ceratobasidium, but also occasionally with some ascomycetes. Ancestral
   mycorrhizal specificity was narrow in the orchids, and broadened rarely
   as Goodyera speciated. Statistical tests of phylogenetic inertia
   suggested some support for specificity varying with increasing
   phylogenetic distance, though only when the phylogenetic distance
   between suites of fungi interacting with each plant taxon were taken
   into account. These patterns suggest a role for phylogenetic
   conservatism in maintaining suits of fungal hosts among plants. We
   stress the evolutionary importance of host breadth in these organisms,
   and suggest that even generalists are likely to be constrained
   evolutionarily to maintaining associations with their symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Current forestry policy promotes the use of local seed for new
   plantings, on the assumption that local material may be better adapted
   to local conditions. However, landscape-scale genetic studies which are
   necessary to underpin conservation and breeding strategies are often
   lacking. We investigated molecular diversity in common ash (Fraxinus
   excelsior L.) sampled from 42 British and six French sites with
   microsatellites. Chloroplast haplotype H04 was the most common and
   widespread in Britain, although rare and localized individuals with H02
   and H09 were also detected. In addition, three new chloroplast
   haplotypes were identified, and these were rare and highly localized. In
   terms of nuclear microsatellite markers, allelic richness differed
   between sites and decreased in an east to west direction.
   Differentiation between sites was often very low (mean F(ST) 0.025),
   indicating few differences between the majority of sites. There was a
   clear excess of homozygotes (mean H(O) 0.669, mean H(E) 0.818) and a
   relatively high F(IS) (mean 0.182), suggests a consistent level of
   inbreeding or a widespread Wahlund effect in many F. excelsior sites.
   Gene pool ancestry analysis suggested that the majority of British F.
   excelsior belongs to a single meta-population which covers mainland
   western and central Europe. Three northern and western sites diverged
   markedly from the dominant population, and may represent remnants of two
   late potential Ice Age refugia in northern Britain. The data provide new
   information which will aid development of appropriate conservation
   policies for ash and other wind pollinated tree species.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of population structure is a valuable tool for studying
   the ecology of endangered species and drafting conservation strategies.
   As we enhance our understanding about the structuring of natural
   populations, it becomes important that we also understand the processes
   behind these patterns. However, there are few rigorous assessments of
   the influence of environmental factors on genetic patterns in mobile
   marine species. Given their dispersal capabilities and localized habitat
   preferences, coastal cetaceans are adequate study species for evaluating
   environmental effects on marine population structure. The franciscana
   dolphin, a rare coastal cetacean endemic to the Western South Atlantic,
   was studied to examine these issues. We analysed genetic data from the
   mitochondrial DNA and 12 microsatellite markers for 275 franciscana
   samples utilizing frequency-based, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian
   algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. This
   information was combined with 10 years of remote sensing environmental
   data (chlorophyll concentration, water turbidity and surface
   temperature). Our analyses show the occurrence of genetically isolated
   populations within Argentina, in areas that are environmentally
   distinct. Combined evidence of genetic and environmental structure
   suggests that isolation by distance and a process here termed isolation
   by environmental distance can explain the observed correlations. Our
   approach elucidated important ecological and conservation aspects of
   franciscana dolphins, and has the potential to increase our
   understanding of ecological processes influencing genetic patterns in
   other marine species.}},

Abstract = {{Although loss of genetic variation is frequently assumed to be
   associated with loss of adaptive potential, only few studies have
   examined adaptation in populations with little genetic variation. On the
   Swedish west coast, the northern fringe populations of the natterjack
   toad Bufo calamita inhabit an atypical habitat consisting of offshore
   rock islands. There are strong among-population differences in the
   amount of neutral genetic variation, making this system suitable for
   studies on mechanisms of trait divergence along a gradient of
   within-population genetic variation. In this study, we examined the
   mechanisms of population divergence using Q(ST)-F(ST) comparisons and
   correlations between quantitative and neutral genetic variation. Our
   results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the six
   populations included in this study, as indicated by low Q(ST)-F(ST)
   values, lack of significant population x temperature interactions and
   lack of significant differences among the islands in breeding pond size.
   The six populations included in this study differed in both neutral and
   quantitative genetic variation. Also, the correlations between neutral
   and quantitative genetic variation tended to be positive, however, the
   relatively small number of populations prevents any strong conclusions
   based on these correlations. Contrary to the majority of Q(ST)-F(ST)
   comparisons, our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection
   across the examined populations. Furthermore, the low heritability of
   fitness-related traits may limit evolutionary responses in some of the
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Bartonella is a genus of vector-borne bacteria that infect the red blood
   cells of mammals, and includes several human-specific and zoonotic
   pathogens. Bartonella grahamii has a wide host range and is one of the
   most prevalent Bartonella species in wild rodents. We studied the
   population structure, genome content and genome plasticity of a
   collection of 26 B. grahamii isolates from 11 species of wild rodents in
   seven countries. We found strong geographic patterns, high recombination
   frequencies and large variations in genome size in B. grahamii compared
   with previously analysed cat- and human-associated Bartonella species.
   The extent of sequence divergence in B. grahamii populations was
   markedly lower in Europe and North America than in Asia, and several
   recombination events were predicted between the Asian strains. We
   discuss environmental and demographic factors that may underlie the

Abstract = {{An excellent model to elucidate the mechanisms and importance of
   evolution in the marine environment is the spectral tuning mechanism of
   the visual pigment in vertebrates. In the sand goby Pomatoschistus
   minutus (Teleostei; Gobiidae), a distribution-wide study showed that
   spatial variation at the rhodopsin gene (RH1) matches the
   characteristics of specific light environments. This match suggests that
   populations are locally adapted to selective light regimes targeting the
   RH1 gene. If so, then the direction of selection should depend on the
   regional spatial and temporal stability of the light conditions. We
   tested this prediction by comparing goby populations from two regions:
   the Baltic Sea, characterized by divergent, but temporally stable light
   conditions, and the North Sea, characterized by locally heterogeneous
   and temporally variable light conditions. RH1 sequences of 491
   Pomatoschistus minutus individuals from 15 locations were analysed. We
   found that variation at the RH1 gene in the Baltic populations showed
   signatures of diversifying selection, whereas the RH1 gene in the North
   Sea showed signatures of stabilizing selection. These different modes of
   selection are consistent with the regional light conditions and hence
   support our predictions, but may also be influenced by migration between
   the open sea and more turbid estuarine environments. An interesting
   observation is that within one gene, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs
   show a totally different pattern between populations. Population
   differentiation based on non-synonymous SNPs of the RH1 gene correlated
   with spectral variation of the local environment of the sand goby
   populations. In contrast, the differentiation based on synonymous SNPs
   of RH1 reflects more the neutral historical pattern of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forests have undergone repeated fragmentation and expansion
   during Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods, respectively. The
   effects of this repeated forest fragmentation in driving vicariance in
   tropical taxa have been well studied. However, relatively little is
   known about how often this process results in allopatric speciation,
   since it may be inhibited by recurrent gene flow during repeated
   secondary contact, or to what extent Pleistocene-dated speciation
   results from ecological specialization in the face of gene flow. Here,
   divergence times and gene flow between three closely-related mosquito
   species of the Anopheles dirus species complex endemic to the forests of
   Southeast Asia, are inferred using coalescent based Bayesian analysis.
   An Isolation with Migration model is applied to sequences of two
   mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, and 11 microsatellites. The
   divergence of An. scanloni has occurred despite unidirectional nuclear
   gene flow from this species into An. dirus. The inferred asymmetric gene
   flow may result from the unique evolutionary adaptation of An. scanloni
   to limestone karst habitat, and therefore the fitness advantage of this
   species over An. dirus in regions of sympatry. Mitochondrial
   introgression has led to the complete replacement of An. dirus
   haplotypes with those of An. baimaii through a recent (similar to 62
   kya) selective sweep. Speciation of An. baimaii and An. dirus is
   inferred to have involved allopatric divergence throughout much of the
   Pleistocene. Secondary contact and bidirectional gene flow has occurred
   only within the last 100 000 years, by which time the process of
   allopatric speciation seems to have been largely completed.}},

Abstract = {{Plant feeding insects and the plants they feed upon represent an
   ecological association that is thought to be a key factor for the
   diversification of many plant feeding insects, through differential
   adaptation to different plant selective pressures. While a number of
   studies have investigated diversification of plant feeding insects above
   the species level, relatively less attention has been given to patterns
   of diversification within species, particularly those that also require
   plants for oviposition and subsequent larval development. In the case of
   plant feeding insects that also require plant tissues for the completion
   of their reproductive cycle through larval development, the divergent
   selective pressure not only acts on adults, but on the full life history
   of the insect. Here we focus attention on Rhinusa antirrhini
   (Curculionidae), a species of weevil broadly distributed across Europe
   that both feeds on, and oviposits and develops within, species of the
   plant genus Linaria (Plantaginaceae). Using a combination of mtDNA
   (COII) and nuclear DNA (EF1-alpha) sequencing and copulation experiments
   we assess evidence for host associated genetic differentiation within R.
   antirrhini. We find substantial genetic variation within this species
   that is best explained by ecological specialisation on different host
   plant taxa. This genetic differentiation is most pronounced in the mtDNA
   marker, with patterns of genetic variation at the nuclear marker
   suggesting incomplete lineage sorting and/or gene flow between different
   host plant forms of R. antirrhini, whose origin is estimated to date to
   the mid-Pliocene (3.77 Mya; 2.91-4.80 Mya).}},

Abstract = {{It is not yet clear under what conditions empirical studies can reliably
   detect progress toward ecological speciation through the analysis of
   allelic variation at neutral loci. We use a simulation approach to
   investigate the range of parameter space under which such detection is,
   and is not, likely. We specifically test for the conditions under which
   divergent natural selection can cause a `generalized barrier to gene
   flow' that is present across the genome. Our individual-based numerical
   simulations focus on how population divergence at neutral loci varies in
   relation to recombination rate with a selected locus, divergent
   selection on that locus, migration rate and population size. We
   specifically test whether genetic differences at neutral markers are
   greater between populations in different environments than between
   populations in similar environments. We find that this expected
   signature of ecological speciation can be detected under part of the
   parameter space, most consistently when divergent selection is strong
   and migration is intermediate. By contrast, the expected signature of
   ecological speciation is not reliably detected when divergent selection
   is weak or migration is low or high. These findings provide insights
   into the strengths and weaknesses of using neutral markers to infer
   ecological speciation in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Placozoa has been a key phylum for understanding early metazoan
   evolution. Yet this phylum is officially monotypic and with respect to
   its general biology and ecology has remained widely unknown. Worldwide
   sampling and sequencing of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit
   (16S) reveals a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical and subtropical
   waters of genetically different clades. We sampled a total of 39
   tropical and subtropical locations worldwide and found 23 positive sites
   for placozoans. The number of genetically characterized sites was
   thereby increased from 15 to 37. The new sampling identified the first
   genotypes from two new oceanographic regions, the Eastern Atlantic and
   the Indian Ocean. We found seven out of 11 previously known haplotypes
   as well as five new haplotypes. One haplotype resembles a new genetic
   clade, increasing the number of clades from six to seven. Some of these
   clades seem to be cosmopolitan whereas others appear to be endemic. The
   phylogeography also shows that different clades occupy different
   ecological niches and identifies several euryoecious haplotypes with a
   cosmopolitic distribution as well as some stenoecious haplotypes with an
   endemic distribution. Haplotypes of different clades differ
   substantially in their phylogeographic distribution according to
   latitude. The genetic data also suggest deep phylogenetic branching
   patterns between clades.}},

Title = {{Fitness benefits of polyandry for experienced females}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2328-2335}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Females often mate with several different males, which may promote sperm
   competition and increase offspring viability. However, the potential
   benefits of polyandry remain controversial, particularly in birds where
   recent reviews have suggested that females gain few genetic benefits
   from extra-pair mating. In tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we found
   that females with prior breeding experience had more sires per brood
   when paired to genetically similar social mates, and, among experienced
   females, broods with more sires had higher hatching success. Individual
   females breeding in two consecutive years also produced broods with more
   sires when they were more genetically similar to their mate. Thus,
   experienced females were able to avoid the costs of mating with a
   genetically similar social mate and realize fitness benefits from mating
   with a relatively large number of males. This is one of the first
   studies to show that female breeding experience influences polyandry and
   female fitness in a natural population of vertebrates. Our results
   suggest that the benefits of polyandry may only be clear when
   considering both the number of mates females acquire and their ability
   to modify the outcome of sexual conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding occurs in numerous animal and plant species. In haplodiploid
   hymenopterans with the widespread single locus complementary sex
   determination, the frequency of diploid males, which are produced at the
   expense of females, is increased under inbreeding. Diploid males in
   species of bees, ants and wasps are typically either unviable or
   effectively sterile and thus impose a severe genetic load on
   populations. However, a recent study indicated that diploid males can be
   reproductive in the gregarious parasitoid wasp Cotesia glomerata,
   effectively reducing the diploid male load. To understand the role of
   inbreeding as a potential selective pressure towards the evolution of
   diploid male fertility, we genotyped specimens collected in the field at
   four locations using microsatellite markers to estimate the ratio of
   sibling matings under natural conditions. Results show that more than
   half of all matings involved siblings. We argue that the frequent
   occurrence of inbreeding has driven the evolution of diploid male
   fertility.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of transgenes into the genome of wild soybean is a concern
   when transgenic and wild soybeans are planted sympatrically. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the origin and fate of
   morphological intermediates between wild and cultivated soybeans in
   their natural habitats in Japan. Twenty nuclear microsatellite and two
   chloroplast dCAPS markers were used to evaluate genetic variation of 468
   wild, 17 intermediate, and 12 cultivated soybean samples collected from
   six sites between 2003 and 2006. Allelic differentiation of
   microsatellite markers between wild and cultivated soybeans was
   sufficient to detect their hybrids. Based on levels of observed
   heterozygosity, intermediate soybean plants were from two generations:
   either F(1) or an early segregating generation. Genetic admixture
   analysis and parentage assignment analysis revealed that the parents of
   all intermediate soybean plants could be assigned to a particular wild
   soybean plant and late-maturing cultivar. The chloroplast DNA haplotypes
   revealed that all intermediate soybean plants originated from gene flow
   from cultivated to wild soybeans at all sites. Based on monitoring at
   both the phenotypic and molecular levels, hybrids quickly disappeared
   from natural habitats, and secondary gene flow from these plants to wild
   soybean was not detected. Thus, while gene flow from transgenic soybean
   into wild soybean can occur, gene introgression appears to be rare in
   natural habitats in Japan. This is the first report on the detection of
   gene flow from cultivated to wild soybean at the molecular level.}},

Abstract = {{Subject to environmental changes and recurrent isolation in the last ca.
   250 Ma, cycads are often described as relicts of a previously common
   lineage, with populations characterized by low genetic variation and
   restricted gene flow. We found that on the island of Guam, the endemic
   Cycas micronesica has most of the genetic variation of 14
   EST-microsatellites distributed within each of 18 genetic populations,
   from 24 original sampling sites. There were high levels of genetic
   variation in terms of total number of alleles and private alleles, and
   moderate levels of inbreeding. Restricted but ongoing gene flow among
   populations within Guam reveals a genetic mosaic, probably more typical
   of cycads than previously assumed. Contiguous cycad populations in the
   north of Guam had higher self-recruitment rates compared to fragmented
   populations in the south, with no substantial connection between them
   except for one population. Guam's genetic mosaic may be explained by the
   influence of forest continuity, seed size, edaphic differences, and
   human transport of cycads. Also important are the extent of synchrony
   among flushes of reproductive female seed-bearing sporophylls and
   restricted pollen movement by an obligate mutualist and generalist
   insects. An NADH EST-locus under positive selection may reflect pressure
   from edaphic differences across Guam. This and three other loci are
   ideal candidates for ecological genomic studies. Given this species'
   vulnerability due to the recent introduction of the cycad aulacaspis
   scale, we also identify priority populations for ex situ conservation,
   and provide a genetic baseline for understanding the effects of invasive
   species on cycads in the Western Pacific, and islands in general.}},

Abstract = {{Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in four Scandinavian populations of
   willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) and two Scottish populations of red
   grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) were assessed at 13 protein-coding
   loci. We found high levels of diversity, with one substitution every 55
   bp as an average and a total of 76 unlinked parsimony informative SNPs.
   Different estimators of genetic diversity such as: number of synonymous
   and non-synonymous sites, average number of alleles, number and
   percentage of polymorphic loci, mean nucleotide diversity (pi(s), pi(a))
   and gene diversity at synonymous and non-synonymous sites showed higher
   diversity in the northern populations compared to southern ones. Strong
   levels of purifying selection found in all the populations together with
   neutrality tests conforming to neutral expectations agree with large
   effective population sizes. Assignment tests reported a clear
   distinction between Scandinavian and Scottish grouse suggesting the
   existence of two different evolutionary significant units. The
   divergence time between willow and red grouse ranging between 12 500 and
   125 000 years, in conjunction with the presence of `specific' markers
   for each subspecies prompt a reassessment of the taxonomical status of
   the Scottish red grouse.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrasses structure some of the world's key coastal ecosystems
   presently in decline due to human activities and global change. The
   ability to cope with environmental changes and the possibilities for
   shifts in distribution range depend largely on their evolvability and
   dispersal potential. As large-scale data usually show strong genetic
   structure for seagrasses, finer-grained work is needed to understand the
   local processes of dispersal, recruitment and colonization that could
   explain the apparent lack of exchange across large distances. We aimed
   to assess the fine-grained genetic structure of one of the most
   important and widely distributed seagrasses, Zostera marina, from seven
   meadows in Brittany, France. Both classic population genetics and
   network analysis confirmed a pattern of spatial segregation of
   polymorphism at both regional and local scales. One location exhibiting
   exclusively the variety `angustifolia' did not appear more
   differentiated than the others, but instead showed a central position in
   the network analysis, confirming the status of this variety as an
   ecotype. This phenotypic diversity and the high allelic richness at nine
   microsatellites (2.33-9.67 alleles/locus) compared to levels previously
   reported across the distribution range, points to Brittany as a centre
   of diversity for Z. marina at both genetic and phenotypic levels.
   Despite dispersal potential of several 100 m, a significant pattern of
   genetic differentiation, even at fine-grained scale, revealed `genetic
   patchiness'. Meadows seem to be composed of a mosaic of clones with
   distinct origins in space and time, a result that calls into question
   the accuracy of the concept of populations for such partially clonal
   species.}},

Abstract = {{In small and declining populations levels of genetic variability are
   expected to be reduced due to effects of inbreeding and random genetic
   drift. As a result, both individual fitness and populations'
   adaptability can be compromised, and the probability of extinction
   increased. Therefore, maintenance of genetic variability is a crucial
   goal in conservation biology. Here we show that although the level of
   genetic variability in mtDNA of the endangered Fennoscandian lesser
   white-fronted goose Anser erythropus population is currently lower than
   in the neigbouring populations, it has increased sixfold during the past
   140 years despite the precipitously declining population. The
   explanation for increased genetic diversity in Fennoscandia appears to
   be recent spontaneous increase in male immigration rate equalling 0.56
   per generation. This inference is supported by data on nuclear
   microsatellite markers, the latter of which show that the current and
   the historical Fennoscandian populations are significantly
   differentiated (F(ST) = 0.046, P = 0) due to changes in allele
   frequencies. The effect of male-mediated gene flow is potentially
   dichotomous. On the one hand it may rescue the Fennoscandian lesser
   white-fronted goose from loss of genetic variability, but on the other
   hand, it eradicates the original genetic characteristics of this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Population loss is often a harbinger of species extinction, but few
   opportunities exist to follow a species' demography and genetics through
   both time and space while this occurs. Previous research has shown that
   the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) was extirpated from most of
   its range over the past 200-800 years and that some of the extirpated
   populations had unique life history strategies. In this study,
   widespread availability of subfossils in the eastern Pacific allowed us
   to examine temporal changes in spatial genetic structure during massive
   population range contraction and partial recovery. We sequenced the
   mitochondrial control region from 40 ancient and 365 modern samples and
   analyzed them through extensive simulations within a serial Approximate
   Bayesian Computation framework. These analyses suggest that the species
   maintained a high abundance, probably in subarctic refugia, that
   dispersal rates are likely 85\% per generation into new breeding
   colonies, and that population structure was not higher in the past.
   Despite substantial loss of breeding range, this species' high dispersal
   rates and refugia appear to have prevented a loss of genetic diversity.
   High dispersal rates also suggest that previous evidence for divergent
   life history strategies in ancient populations likely resulted from
   behavioral plasticity. Our results support the proposal that panmictic,
   or nearly panmictic, species with large ranges will be more resilient to
   future disturbance and environmental change. When appropriately
   verified, evidence of low population structure can be powerful
   information for conservation decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{The opportunity for a mutation to invade a population can dramatically
   vary depending on the context in which this mutation occurs. Such
   context dependence is difficult to document as it requires the ability
   to measure how a mutation affects phenotypes and fitness and to
   manipulate the context in which the mutation occurs. We identified a
   mutation in a gene encoding a global regulator in one of two ecotypes
   that diverged from a common ancestor during 1200 generations of
   experimental evolution. We replaced the ancestral allele by the mutant
   allele, and vice versa, in several clones isolated during the time
   course of the evolution experiment, and compared the phenotype and
   fitness of clones isogenic except for the focal mutation. We show that
   the fitness and phenotype of the mutation are strongly affected by
   epistatic interactions between genes in the same genome, as well as by
   frequency dependent selection resulting from biotic interactions between
   individuals in the same population. We conclude that amongst the
   replicate population in which it spread, the mutation we identified is
   only adaptive when occurring in specific genomes and competing with
   specific individuals. This study thus demonstrates that the opportunity
   for an adaptive mutation to spread in an evolutionary lineage can only
   be understood in the light of its genomic and competitive environments.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological divergence plays a prominent role in the process of
   speciation, but how divergence occurs in the face of gene flow is still
   less clear, and remains controversial among evolutionists. Here we
   investigated the nucleotide diversity, divergence and gene flow between
   Oryza nivara and O. rufipogon using sequences of seven chloroplast and
   nuclear loci. By analysing samples from 26 wild populations across the
   geographic ranges of the two species, we showed that both species were
   highly structured and O. rufipogon maintained a higher level of
   species-wide diversity than O. nivara. Notably, phylogenetic, AMOVA and
   F(ST) analyses were unable to detect significant nucleotide
   differentiation between the two species. We estimated that the two
   species began to diverge at c. 0.16 million years ago. Our
   coalescent-based simulations strongly rejected the simple isolation
   model of zero migration between species, but rather provided unambiguous
   evidence of bidirectional gene flow between species, particularly from
   O. rufipogon to O. nivara. Our simulations also indicated that gene flow
   was recurrent during the divergence process rather than arising from
   secondary contact after allopatric divergence. In conjunction with
   different morphological and life-history traits and habitat preference
   in the two species, this study supports the hypothesis that these Oryza
   species are better treated as ecotypes that diverged quite recently and
   are still under the process of divergence. Importantly, we demonstrate
   the ecological divergence between O. rufipogon and O. nivara in the
   presence of significant gene flow, implying that natural selection plays
   a primary role in driving the divergence of the two Oryza species.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of genetic variation within and among populations is
   commonly used to infer their demographic and evolutionary histories.
   This endeavour has the potential to benefit substantially from
   high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies through a rapid
   increase in the amount of data available and a corresponding increase in
   the precision of parameter estimation. Here we report the results of a
   phylogeographic study of the North American butterfly genus Lycaeides
   using 454 sequence data. This study serves the dual purpose of
   demonstrating novel molecular and analytical methods for population
   genetic analyses with 454 sequence data and expanding our knowledge of
   the phylogeographic history of Lycaeides. We obtained 341 045 sequence
   reads from 12 populations that we were able to assemble into 15 262
   contigs (most of which were variable), representing one of the largest
   population genetic data sets for a non-model organism to date. We
   examined patterns of genetic variation using a hierarchical Bayesian
   analysis of molecular variance model, which provides precise estimates
   of genome-level phi(ST) while appropriately modelling uncertainty in
   locus-specific phi(ST). We found that approximately 36\% of sequence
   variation was partitioned among populations, suggesting historical or
   current isolation among the sampled populations. Estimates of pairwise
   genome-level phi(ST) were largely consistent with a previous
   phylogeographic model for Lycaeides, suggesting fragmentation into two
   to three refugia during Pleistocene glacial cycles followed by
   post-Pleistocene range expansion and secondary contact leading to
   introgressive hybridization. This study demonstrates the potential of
   using genome-level data to better understand the phylogeographic history
   of populations.}},

Abstract = {{Japanese house mice (Mus musculus molossinus) are thought to be a hybrid
   lineage derived from two prehistoric immigrants, the subspecies M. m.
   musculus of northern Eurasia and M. m. castaneus of South Asia. Mice of
   the western European subspecies M. m. domesticus have been detected in
   Japanese ports and airports only. We examined haplotype structuring of a
   200 kb stretch on chromosome 8 for 59 mice from throughout Eurasia,
   determining short segments (approximate to 370-600 bp) of eight nuclear
   genes (Fanca, Spire2, Tcf25, Mc1r, Tubb3, Def8, Afg3l1 and Dbndd1) which
   are intermittently arranged in this order. Where possible we identified
   the subspecies origin for individual gene alleles and then designated
   haplotypes for concatenated alleles. We recovered 11 haplotypes among 19
   Japanese mice examined, identified either as `intact' haplotypes derived
   from the subspecies musculus (57.9\%), domesticus (7.9\%), and castaneus
   (2.6\%), or as `recombinant' haplotypes (31.6\%). We also detected
   recombinant haplotypes unique to Sakhalin. The complex nature of the
   recombinant haplotypes suggests ancient introduction of all three
   subspecies components into the peripheral part of Eurasia or complicated
   genomic admixture before the movement from source areas. `Intact'
   domesticus and castaneus haplotypes in other Japanese wild mice imply
   ongoing stowaway introductions. The method has general utility for
   assessing the history of genetic admixture and for disclosing ongoing
   genetic contamination.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure and demographic history of an endemic Chinese
   gecko, Gekko swinhonis, were investigated by analysing the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b gene and 10 microsatellite loci for samples collected from
   27 localities. Mitochondrial DNA data provided a detailed distribution
   of two highly divergent evolutionary lineages, between which the average
   pairwise distance achieved was 0.14. The geographic division of the two
   lineages coincided with a plate boundary consisting of the Qinling and
   Taihang Mts, suggesting a historical vicariant pattern. The orogeny of
   the Qinling Mts, a dispersal and major climatic barrier of the region,
   may have launched the independent lineage divergence. Both lineages have
   experienced recent expansion, and the current sympatric localities
   comprised the region of contact between the lineages. Individual-based
   phylogenetic analyses of nucDNA and Bayesian-clustering approaches
   revealed a deep genetic structure analogous to mtDNA. Incongruence
   between nucDNA and mtDNA at the individual level at localities outside
   of the contact region can be explained by the different inheritance
   patterns and male-biased dispersal in this species. High genetic
   divergence, long-term isolation and ecological adaptation, as well as
   the morphological differences, suggest the presence of a cryptic
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern coastal plain of the United States is a region marked
   by extraordinary phylogeographic congruence that is frequently
   attributed to the changing sea levels that occurred during the
   glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene epoch. A phylogeographic
   break corresponding to the Apalachicola River has been suggested for
   many species studied to date that are endemic to this region. Here, we
   used this pattern of phylogeographic congruence to develop and test
   explicit hypotheses about the genetic structure in the ornate chorus
   frog (Pseudacris ornata). Using 1299 bp of mtDNA sequence and seven
   nuclear microsatellite markers in 13 natural populations of P. ornata,
   we found three clades corresponding to geographically distinct regions;
   one spans the Apalachicola River (Southern Clade), one encompasses
   Georgia and South Carolina (Central Clade) and a third comprises more
   northerly individuals (Northern Clade). However, it does not appear that
   typical phylogeographic barriers demarcate these clades. Instead,
   isolation by distance across the range of the entire species explained
   the pattern of genetic variation that we observed. We propose that P.
   ornata was historically widespread in the southeastern United States,
   and that a balance between genetic drift and migration was the root of
   the genetic divergence among populations. Additionally, we investigated
   fine-scale patterns of genetic structure and found the spatial scale at
   which there was significant genetic structure varied among the regions
   studied. Furthermore, we discuss our results in light of other
   phylogeographic studies of southeastern coastal plain organisms and in
   relation to amphibian conservation and management.}},

Abstract = {{Two endemic groundwater arthropod crustacean species, Crangonyx
   islandicus and Crymostygius thingvallensis, were recently discovered on
   the mid-Atlantic volcanic island of Iceland. The extent of morphological
   differences from closest relatives, endemism, along with the geographic
   isolation of Iceland and its complete coverage by glaciers 21 000 years
   ago, suggests that these two species have survived glaciation periods in
   sub-glacial refugia. Here we provide strong support for this hypothesis
   by an analysis of mitochondrial genetic variation within Crangonyx
   islandicus. Our results show that the species is divided into several
   distinct monophyletic groups that are found along the volcanic zone in
   Iceland, which have been separated by 0.5 to around 5 million years. The
   genetic divergence between groups reflects geographic distances between
   sampling sites, indicating that divergence occurred after the
   colonization of Iceland. The genetic patterns, as well as the dependency
   of genetic variation on distances from the tectonic plate boundary and
   altitude, points to recent expansion from several refugia within
   Iceland. This presents the first genetic evidence of multicellular
   organisms as complex as crustacean amphipods which have survived
   glaciations beneath an ice sheet. This survival may be explained by
   geothermal heat linked to volcanic activities, which may have maintained
   favourable habitats in fissures along the tectonic plate boundary in
   Iceland during glaciations.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, montane tropical diversity is characterized by extraordinary
   local endemism that is not readily explained by current environmental
   variables indicating a strong imprint of history. Montane species often

   substantial genetic and phenotypic divergence. Alternatively,
   populations may have become contiguous during colder climates resulting
   in less divergence. Here we compare responses to historical climate
   fluctuation in a montane specialist skink, Lampropholis robertsi, and
   its more broadly distributed congener, L. coggeri, both endemic to
   rainforests of northeast Australia. To do so, we combine spatial
   modelling of potential distributions under representative
   palaeoclimates, multi-locus phylogeography and analyses of phenotypic
   variation. Spatial modelling of L. robertsi predicts strong isolation
   among disjunct montane refugia during warm climates, but with potential
   for localized exchange during the most recent glacial period. In
   contrast, predicted stable areas are more widespread and connected in L.
   coggeri. Both species exhibit pronounced phylogeographic structuring for
   mitochondrial and nuclear genes, attesting to low dispersal and high
   persistence across multiple isolated regions. This is most prominent in
   L. robertsi, for which coalescent analyses indicate that most
   populations persisted in isolation throughout the climate cycles of the
   Pleistocene. Morphological divergence, principally in body size, is more
   evident among isolated populations of L. robertsi than L. coggeri. These
   results highlight the biodiversity value of isolated montane populations
   and support the general hypothesis that tropical montane regions harbour
   high levels of narrow-range taxa because of their resilience to past
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Preferences for mates carrying dissimilar genes at the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) may help animals increase offspring
   pathogen resistance or avoid inbreeding. Such preferences have been
   reported across a range of vertebrates, but have rarely been
   investigated in social species other than humans. We investigated mate
   choice and MHC dynamics in wild baboons (Papio ursinus). MHC Class II
   DRB genes and 16 microsatellite loci were genotyped across six groups
   (199 individuals). Based on the survey of a key segment of the gene-rich
   MHC, we found no evidence of mate choice for MHC dissimilarity,
   diversity or rare MHC genotypes. First, MHC dissimilarity did not differ
   from random expectation either between parents of the same offspring or
   between immigrant males and females from the same troop. Second, female
   reproductive success was not influenced by MHC diversity or genotype
   frequency. Third, population genetic structure analysis revealed equally
   high genotypic differentiation among troops, and comparable excess
   heterozygosity within troops for juveniles, at both Mhc-DRB and neutral
   loci. Nevertheless, the age structure of Mhc-DRB heterozygosity
   suggested higher longevity for heterozygotes, which should favour
   preferences for MHC dissimilarity. We propose that high levels of
   within-group outbreeding, resulting from group-living and sex-biased
   dispersal, might weaken selection for MHC-disassortative mate choice.}},

Abstract = {{Selection during the colonization of new habitat is critical to the
   process of local adaptation, but has rarely been studied. We measured
   the form, direction, and strength of selection on body size and date of
   arrival to the breeding grounds over the first three cohorts (2003-2005)
   of a coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population colonizing 33 km of
   habitat made accessible by modification of Landsburg Diversion Dam, on
   the Cedar River, Washington, USA. Salmon were sampled as they bypassed
   the dam, parentage was assigned based on genotypes from 10
   microsatellite loci, and standardized selection gradients were
   calculated using the number of returning adult offspring as the fitness
   metric. Larger fish in both sexes produced more adult offspring, and the
   magnitude of the effect increased in subsequent years for males,
   suggesting that low densities attenuated traditional size-biased
   intrasexual competition. For both sexes, directional selection favoured
   early breeders in 2003, but stabilizing selection on breeding date was
   observed in 2004 and 2005. Adults that arrived, and presumably bred,
   early produced stream-rearing juvenile offspring that were larger at a
   common date than offspring from later parents, providing a possible
   mechanism linking breeding date to offspring viability. Comparison to
   studies employing similar methodology indicated selection during
   colonization was strong, particularly with respect to reproductive
   timing. Finally, female mean reproductive success exceeded that needed
   for replacement in all years so the population expanded in the first
   generation, demonstrating that salmon can proficiently exploit vacant
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection theory predicts competitive males and choosy females.
   Nevertheless, since molecular marker-based studies, paternity outside
   the expected mating patterns has increasingly been described. Even in
   highly polygynous systems, where paternity is expected to be strongly
   skewed towards large, dominant males, alternative mating tactics have
   been suggested. We examined reproductive success in the polygynous
   Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki). Semiaquatic territoriality
   allows females to move freely and may lower the degree of polygyny
   otherwise suggested by both territorial behaviour and strong sexual
   dimorphism. We assigned paternities with 22 microsatellites and analysed
   how male reproductive success was related to size, dominance status,
   intrasexual agonistic behaviour, proximity to females, and attendance in
   the colony. Male behaviour was consistent across two seasons for all
   parameters under consideration. Attendance was by far the most important
   determinant of paternal success. Skew in reproductive success towards
   large, dominant males was weak and dominance status played no role. This
   appears to be caused by an extremely long reproductive season lasting
   five or more months, making it difficult for any male to monopolize
   receptive females. Females seem to choose displaying males that were
   present in the colony for a long time rather than dominance per se.
   Sexual dimorphism in Galapagos sea lions may thus be more influenced by
   selection for fasting than fighting ability. Our data provide further
   evidence for alternative mating tactics, as several males gained
   relatively high reproductive success despite short attendance and hardly
   any involvement in agonistic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Two fundamental symbiosis-based trophic types are recognized among
   Zoanthidea (Cnidaria, Anthozoa): fixed carbon is either obtained
   directly from zooxanthellae photosymbionts or from environmental sources
   through feeding with the assistance of host-invertebrate behaviour and
   structure. Each trophic type is characteristic of the suborders of
   Zoanthidea and is associated with substantial distributional
   asymmetries: suborder Macrocnemina are symbionts of invertebrates and
   have global geographic and bathymetric distributions and suborder
   Brachycnemina are hosts of endosymbiotic zooxanthellae and are
   restricted to tropical photic zones. While exposure to solar radiation
   could explain the bathymetric asymmetry it does not explain the
   geographic asymmetry, nor is it clear why evolutionary transitions to
   the zooxanthellae-free state have apparently occurred within
   Macrocnemina but not within Brachycnemina. To better understand the
   transitions between symbiosis-based trophic types of Zoanthidea, a
   concatenated data set of nuclear and mitochondrial nucleotide sequences
   were used to test hypotheses of monophyly for groups defined by
   morphology and symbiosis, and to reconstruct the evolutionary
   transitions of morphological and symbiotic characters. The results
   indicate that the morphological characters that define Macrocnemina are
   plesiomorphic and the characters that define its subordinate taxa are
   homoplasious. Symbioses with invertebrates have ancient and recent
   transitions with a general pattern of stability in host associations
   through evolutionary time. The reduction in distribution of Zoanthidea
   is independent of the evolution of zooxanthellae symbiosis and
   consistent with hypotheses of the benefits of invertebrate symbioses,
   indicating that the ability to persist in most habitats may have been
   lost with the termination of symbioses with invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{An important task within conservation genetics consists in defining
   intraspecific conservation units. Most conceptual frameworks involve two
   steps: (i) identifying demographically independent units, and (ii)
   evaluating their degree of adaptive divergence. Whereas a plethora of
   methods are available for delineating genetic population structure,
   assessment of functional genetic divergence remains a challenge. In this
   issue, Tymchuk et al. (2010) study Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   populations using both microsatellite markers and analysis of global
   gene expression. They show that important gene expression differences
   exist that can be interpreted in the context of different ecological
   conditions experienced by the populations, along with the populations'
   histories. This demonstrates an important potential role of
   transcriptomics for designating conservation units.}},

Abstract = {{Sex determination can be purely genetic (as in mammals and birds),
   purely environmental (as in many reptiles), or genetic but reversible by
   environmental factors during a sensitive period in life, as in many fish
   and amphibians (Wallace et al. 1999; Baroiller et al. 2009a; Stelkens \&
   Wedekind 2010). Such environmental sex reversal (ESR) can be induced,
   for example, by temperature changes or by exposure to hormone-active
   substances. ESR has long been recognized as a means to produce more
   profitable single-sex cultures in fish farms (Cnaani \& Levavi-Sivan
   2009), but we know very little about its prevalence in the wild.
   Obviously, induced feminization or masculinization may immediately
   distort population sex ratios, and distorted sex ratios are indeed
   reported from some amphibian and fish populations (Olsen et al. 2006;
   Alho et al. 2008; Brykov et al. 2008). However, sex ratios can also be
   skewed by, for example, segregation distorters or sex-specific
   mortality. Demonstrating ESR in the wild therefore requires the
   identification of sex-linked genetic markers (in the absence of
   heteromorphic sex chromosomes) followed by comparison of genotypes and
   phenotypes, or experimental crosses with individuals who seem sex
   reversed, followed by sexing of offspring after rearing under non-ESR
   conditions and at low mortality. In this issue, Alho et al. (2010)
   investigate the role of ESR in the common frog (Rana temporaria) and a
   population that has a distorted adult sex ratio. They developed new
   sex-linked microsatellite markers and tested wild-caught male and female
   adults for potential mismatches between phenotype and genotype. They
   found a significant proportion of phenotypic males with a female
   genotype. This suggests environmental masculinization, here with a
   prevalence of 9\%. The authors then tested whether XX males naturally
   reproduce with XX females. They collected egg clutches and found that
   some had indeed a primary sex ratio of 100\% daughters. Other clutches
   seemed to result from multi-male fertilizations of which at least one
   male had the female genotype. These results suggest that sex-reversed
   individuals affect the sex ratio in the following generation. But how
   relevant is ESR if its prevalence is rather low, and what are the
   implications of successful reproduction of sex-reversed individuals in
   the wild?}},

Abstract = {{Sex reversal has been suggested to have profound implications for the
   evolution of sex chromosomes and population dynamics in ectotherms.
   Occasional sex reversal of genetic males has been hypothesized to
   prevent the evolutionary decay of nonrecombining Y chromosomes caused by
   the accumulation of deleterious mutations. At the same time, sex
   reversals can have a negative effect on population growth rate. Here, we
   studied phenotypic and genotypic sex in the common frog (Rana
   temporaria) in a subarctic environment, where strongly female-biased sex
   ratios have raised the possibility of frequent sex reversals. We
   developed two novel sex-linked microsatellite markers for the species
   and used them with a third, existing marker and a Bayesian modelling
   approach to study the occurrence of sex reversal and to determine
   primary sex ratios in egg clutches. Our results show that a significant
   proportion (0.09, 95\% credible interval: 0.04-0.18) of adults that were
   genetically female expressed the male phenotype, but there was no
   evidence of sex reversal of genetic males that is required for
   counteracting the degeneration of Y chromosome. The primary sex ratios
   were mostly equal, but three clutches consisted only of genetic females
   and three others had a significant female bias. Reproduction of the
   sex-reversed genetic females appears to create all-female clutches
   potentially skewing the population level adult sex-ratio consistent with
   field observations. However, based on a simulation model, such a bias is
   expected to be small and transient and thus does not fully explain the
   observed female-bias in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic plant invasions are often associated with long-distance
   dispersal of vegetative propagules and prolific clonal reproduction.
   These reproductive features combined with genetic bottlenecks have the
   potential to severely limit genetic diversity in invasive populations.
   To investigate this question we conducted a global scale population
   genetic survey using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers of
   the world's most successful aquatic plant invader - Eichhornia crassipes
   (water hyacinth). We sampled 1140 ramets from 54 populations from the
   native (South America) and introduced range (Asia, Africa, Europe, North
   America, Central America and the Caribbean). Although we detected 49
   clones, introduced populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and
   little differentiation compared with those from the native range, and
   similar to 80\% of introduced populations were composed of a single
   clone. A widespread clone ('W') detected in two Peruvian populations
   accounted for 70.9\% of the individuals sampled and dominated in 74.5\%
   of the introduced populations. However, samples from Bangladesh and
   Indonesia were composed of different genotypes, implicating multiple
   introductions to the introduced range. Nine of 47 introduced populations
   contained clonal diversity suggesting that sexual recruitment occurs in
   some invasive sites where environmental conditions favour seedling
   establishment. The global patterns of genetic diversity in E. crassipes
   likely result from severe genetic bottlenecks during colonization and
   prolific clonal propagation. The prevalence of the `W' genotype
   throughout the invasive range may be explained by stochastic sampling,
   or possibly because of pre-adaptation of the `W' genotype to tolerate
   low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of interactions between farmed and wild salmonid fishes have
   suggested reduced fitness of farmed strains in the wild, but evidence
   for selection at the genic level is lacking. We studied three brown
   trout populations in Denmark which have been significantly admixed with
   stocked hatchery trout (19-64\%), along with two hatchery strains used
   for stocking. The wild populations were represented by contemporary
   samples (2000-2006) and two of them by historical samples (1943-1956).
   We analysed 61 microsatellite loci, nine of which showed putative
   functional relationships {[}expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked or
   quantitative trait loci]. FST-based outlier tests provided support for
   diversifying selection at chromosome regions marked by three loci, two
   anonymous and one EST-linked. Patterns of differentiation suggested that
   the loci were candidates for being under diversifying hitch-hiking
   selection in hatchery vs. wild environments. Analysis of hatchery strain
   admixture proportions showed that in one wild population, two of the
   loci showed significantly lower admixture proportions than the
   putatively neutral loci, implying contemporary selection against alleles
   introduced by hatchery strain trout. In the most strongly admixed
   population, however, there was no evidence for selection, possibly
   because of immigration by stocked trout overcoming selection against
   hatchery-derived alleles or supportive breeding practices allowing
   hatchery strain trout to escape natural selection. To our knowledge,
   this is the first study demonstrating footprints of selection in wild
   salmonid populations subject to spawning intrusion by farmed fish.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction in fungi involves either a single individual
   (selfing) or two individuals (outcrossing). To investigate the roles
   that these two strategies play in the establishment of an invasive alien
   pathogen, the Eucalyptus leaf-infecting fungus, Teratosphaeria
   (Mycosphaerella) nubilosa was studied. Specifically, the genetic
   diversity of the pathogen was investigated at micro and macrospatial
   scales. Interestingly, while data obtained at microspatial scales show
   clearly that selfing is the main reproductive strategy, at macrospatial
   scales the population genetic structure was consistent with a
   genetically outcrossing organism. Additional analyses were performed to
   explore these apparently discordant results at different spatial scales
   and to quantify the contribution of selfing vs. outcrossing to the
   genotypic diversity. The results clearly show that the fungus has a
   mixed mating strategy. While selfing is the predominant form of mating,
   outcrosses must have occurred in the pathogen that increased the
   genotypic diversity of the fungus over time. This mating strategy,
   coupled with the high levels of geneflow between distant populations of
   the pathogen, has created an even distribution of maximum diversity from
   the smallest (leaf) to largest scales (>500 km), which will make
   breeding for resistance difficult. These data illustrate the
   evolutionary potential and danger of the introduction of multiple
   genotypes of a potentially outcrossing pathogen, especially when it has
   a high dispersal potential.}},

Abstract = {{Pelophylax esculentus is a hybridogenetic frog originating from matings
   between P. ridibundus (RR) and P. lessonae (LL). Typically, diploid
   hybrids (LR) live in sympatry with one of their parental species, upon
   which they depend for successful reproduction. In parts of their range,
   however, pure hybrid populations can be found. These hybrid populations
   have achieved reproductive independence from their parental species by
   using triploid hybrids (LLR, LRR) rather than LL and RR as their sexual
   hosts. These different breeding systems also entail differences in
   reproduction (clonal versus sexual) and hence offer the opportunity to
   study how genetic diversity is affected by reproductive mode, population
   structure and geographic location. We investigated 33 populations in the
   Scania region (South Sweden) and 18 additional populations from Northern
   and Central Europe. Within both genomes (L, R), genetic variability
   increases with the potential for recombination and declines from the
   main species distribution area southeast of the Baltic Sea to the fringe
   populations northwest of the Baltic Sea. Within the main study area in
   Scania, genetic diversity is low and decreases from a core area to the
   periphery. Genetic differentiation between Scania populations is small
   but significant and best explained by `isolation by distance'. Despite
   the low genetic variability within the discrete genomes, all-hybrid P.
   esculentus populations in southern Sweden are apparently not suffering
   from direct negative fitness effects. This is probably because of its
   somatic hybrid status, which increases diversity through the combination
   of genomes from two species.}},

Abstract = {{The taxonomic status of brown bears in the Caucasus remains unclear.
   Several morphs or subspecies have been identified from the morphological
   (craniological) data, but the status of each of these subspecies has
   never been verified by molecular genetic methods. We analysed
   mitochondrial DNA sequences (control region) to reveal phylogenetic
   relationships and infer divergence time between brown bear
   subpopulations in the Caucasus. We estimated migration and gene flow
   from both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite allele frequencies, and
   identified possible barriers to gene flow among the subpopulations. Our
   suggestion is that all Caucasian bears belong to the nominal subspecies
   of Ursus arctos. Our results revealed two genetically and geographically
   distinct maternal haplogroups: one from the Lesser Caucasus and the
   other one from the Greater Caucasus. The genetic divergence between
   these haplogroups dates as far back as the beginning of human
   colonization of the Caucasus. Our analysis of the least-cost distances
   between the subpopulations suggests humans as a major barrier to gene
   flow. The low genetic differentiation inferred from microsatellite
   allele frequencies indicates that gene flow between the two populations
   in the Caucasus is maintained through the movements of male brown bears.
   The Likhi Ridge that connects the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountains
   is the most likely corridor for this migration.}},

Abstract = {{Due to difficulties in identifying important within-species biodiversity
   for effective species management and conservation, the use of multiple
   complementary sources of information is required to identify and assess
   the designation of conservation units based on the degree of variation
   among populations within a species. In this study, we combined estimates
   of microsatellite and transcriptomic variation to assess the population
   structure and potential for adaptive variation of threatened Atlantic
   salmon, Salmo salar, among rivers in the Bay of Fundy. In general,
   population structure identified by genetic differentiation was
   consistent with the patterns of variation in gene expression, although
   there was not a strong correlation between neutral genetic variation and
   variation in gene expression. Both data sets provided clear indication
   of strong regional differentiation between rivers located within the
   inner Bay of Fundy relative to rivers located within the outer Bay of
   Fundy or the Southern Upland region, and there was also support for more
   refined population structure. Both data sets indicated that Atlantic
   salmon populations from the inner and outer Bay of Fundy reflect unique
   genetic lineages, with some evidence of population differentiation
   between regions of the inner Bay of Fundy, and between individual rivers
   within a region. Consistency of the microarray data across 2 years
   helped to validate the use of this technique as a useful tool in
   assessment of variation among wild populations for species conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Two factors that can lead to geographic structuring in conspecific
   populations are barriers to dispersal and climatic stability.
   Populations that occur in different physiographic regions may be
   restricted to those areas by physical and/or ecological barriers, which
   may facilitate the formation of phylogeographic clades. Long-term
   climatic stability can also promote genetic diversification, because new
   clades are more likely to evolve in areas that experience lesser
   climatic shifts. We conducted a phylogeographic study of the Puerto
   Rican lizard Anolis krugi to assess whether populations of this anole
   show genetic discontinuities across the species' range, and if they do,
   whether these breaks coincide with the boundaries of the five
   physiographic regions of Puerto Rico. We also assessed whether
   interpopulation genetic distances in A. krugi are positively correlated
   with relative climatic stability in the island. Anolis krugi exhibits
   genetic structuring, but the phylogroups do not correspond to the
   physiographic regions of Puerto Rico. We used climatic reconstructions
   of two environmental extremes of the Quaternary period, the present
   conditions and those during the last glacial maximum (LGM), to quantify
   the degree of climatic stability between sampling locations. We
   documented positive correlations between genetic distances and relative
   climatic stability, although these associations were not significant
   when corrected for autocorrelation. Principal component analyses
   indicated the existence of climatic niche differences between some
   phylogeographic clades of A. krugi. The approach that we employed to
   assess the relationship between climatic stability and the genetic
   architecture of A. krugi can also be used to investigate the impact of
   factors such as the spatial distribution of food sources, parasites,
   predators or competitors on the genetic landscape of a species.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of fossil and molecular data can provide a synthetic
   understanding of the ecological and evolutionary history of an organism.
   We analysed range-wide maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA and
   paternally inherited chloroplast DNA sequence data with coalescent
   simulations and traditional population genetic methods to test
   hypotheses of population divergence generated from the fossil record of
   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), an ecologically and economically
   important western North American conifer. Specifically, we tested (i)
   the hypothesis that the Pliocene orogeny of the Cascades and Sierra
   Nevada caused the divergence of coastal and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir
   varieties; and (ii) the hypothesis that multiple glacial refugia existed
   on the coast and in the Rocky Mountains. We found that Douglas-fir
   varieties diverged about 2.11 Ma (4.37 Ma-755 ka), which could be
   consistent with a Pliocene divergence. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir
   probably resided in three or more glacial refugia. More variable
   molecular markers would be required to detect the two coastal refugia
   suggested in the fossil record. Comparison of mitochondrial DNA and
   chloroplast DNA variation revealed that gene flow via pollen linked
   populations isolated from seed exchange. Postglacial colonization of
   Canada from coastal and Rocky Mountain refugia near the ice margin at
   the Last Glacial Maximum produced a wide hybrid zone among varieties
   that formed almost exclusively by pollen exchange and chloroplast DNA
   introgression, not seed exchange. Postglacial migration rates were
   50-165 m/year, insufficient to track projected 21st century warming in
   some regions. Although fossil and genetic data largely agree, each
   provides unique insights.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic marker-based parentage analyses are widely applied to studies of
   natural populations in the fields of evolutionary biology, conservation
   biology and ecology. When the same markers used in a parentage analysis
   are used together with the inferred parentage in a downstream analysis,
   such as the analysis of mate choice in terms of heterozygosity or
   relatedness, a bias may be incurred because a subset of the genotypes
   are favoured in parentage assignments or non-exclusions. A previous
   simulation study shows that exclusion-based paternity analyses are
   biased in favour of heterozygous males, and males less related to the
   mothers than expected under random mating. In this study, I investigated
   the biases of genetic paternity analyses achieved by both exclusion- and
   likelihood-based methods, using both analytical and simulation
   approaches. It is concluded that while both exclusion- and
   likelihood-based methods can lead to biased paternity assignments or
   non-exclusions in favour of a subset of genotypes, the bias is not
   consistently towards heterozygous males or males apparently less related
   to mothers. Both the direction and extent of the bias depend heavily on
   the allele frequency distribution and the number of markers, the methods
   used for paternity assignments, and the estimators of relatedness. There
   exist important differences in the patterns of the biases between
   exclusion- and likelihood-based paternity analysis methods. It is
   concluded that the markers, except when they are highly informative to
   yield accurate paternity assignments or exclusions, should be split into
   two subsets which are used separately in the paternity and downstream
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the parentage of individuals is required to address a
   variety of questions concerning the evolutionary dynamics of wild
   populations. A major advance in parentage inference in natural
   populations has been the use of molecular markers and the development of
   statistical methods to analyse these data. Cervus, one of the most
   widely used parentage inference programs, uses molecular data to
   determine parent-offspring relationships. However, Cervus does not make
   use of all available information: additional phenotypic information may
   exist predicting parent-offspring relationships, and additional genetic
   information may be exploited by simultaneously considering multiple
   types of relationships rather than just pairwise or just
   parent-offspring relationships. Here we reanalyse data from a wild red
   deer population using two programs capable of using this additional
   information, MasterBayes and COLONY2, and quantify the impact of these
   alternative approaches by comparison with a `known pedigree' estimated
   using a larger suite of microsatellite makers for a subset of the
   population. The use of phenotypic information and multiple relationships
   increased the number of correct assignments. We highlight the
   differences between programs, particularly the use of population-rather
   than individual-level statistical confidence in Cervus. We conclude that
   the use of additional information allows MasterBayes and COLONY2 to
   assign more correct paternities, whereas their use of individual-rather
   than population-level confidence generates fewer erroneous assignments.
   We suggest that maximal information may be gained by combining outputs
   from different programs. Higher accuracy and completeness of pedigree
   information will improve parameters estimated from pedigree information
   in studies of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Although inbreeding depression and mechanisms for kin recognition have
   been described in natural bird populations, inbreeding avoidance through
   mate choice has rarely been reported suggesting that sex-biased
   dispersal is the main mechanism reducing the risks of inbreeding.
   However, a full understanding of the effect of dispersal on the
   occurrence of inbred matings requires estimating the inbreeding risks
   prior to dispersal. Combining pairwise relatedness measures and kinship
   assignments, we investigated in black grouse whether the observed
   occurrence of inbred matings was explained by active kin discrimination
   or by female-biased dispersal. In this large continuous population,
   copulations between close relatives were rare. As female mate choice was
   random for relatedness, females with more relatives in the local flock
   tended to mate with genetically more similar males. To quantify the
   initial risks of inbreeding, we measured the relatedness to the males of
   females captured in their parental flock and virtually translocated
   female hatchlings in their parental and to more distant flocks. These
   tests indicated that dispersal decreased the likelihood of mating with
   relatives and that philopatric females had higher inbreeding risks than
   the actual breeding females. As females do not discriminate against
   relatives, the few inbred matings were probably due to the variance in
   female dispersal propensity and dispersal distance. Our results support
   the view that kin discrimination mate choice is of little value if
   dispersal effectively reduces the risks of inbreeding.}},

Abstract = {{Wolbachia infect a variety of arthropod and nematode hosts, but in
   arthropods, host phylogenetic relationships are usually poor predictors
   of strain similarity. This suggests that new infections are often
   established by horizontal transmission. To gain insight into the factors
   affecting the probability of horizontal transmission among host species,
   we ask how host phylogeny, geographical distribution and ecology affect
   patterns of Wolbachia strain similarity. We used multilocus sequence
   typing (MLST) to characterize Wolbachia strain similarity among dipteran
   hosts associated with fleshy mushrooms. Wolbachia Supergroup A was more
   common than Supergroup B in Diptera, and also more common in mycophagous
   than non-mycophagous Diptera. Within Supergroup A, host family within
   Diptera had no effect on strain similarity, and there was no tendency
   for Wolbachia strains from sympatric host species to be more similar to
   one another than to strains from hosts in different biogeographical
   realms. Supergroup A strains differed between mycophagous and
   non-mycophagous Diptera more than expected by chance, suggesting that
   ecological associations can facilitate horizontal transmission of
   Wolbachia within mycophagous fly communities. For Supergroup B, there
   were no significant associations between strain similarity and host
   phylogeny, biogeography, or ecology. We identified only two cases in
   which closely related hosts carried closely related Wolbachia strains,
   evidence that Wolbachia-host co-speciation or early introgression can
   occur but may not be a major contributor to overall strain diversity.
   Our results suggest that horizontal transmission of Wolbachia can be
   influenced by host ecology, thus leading to partial restriction of
   Wolbachia strains or strain groups to particular guilds of insects.}},

Abstract = {{The Aedes albopictus mosquito has been involved as the principal vector
   of recent major outbreaks due to the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The
   species is naturally infected by two strains of Wolbachia (wAlbA and
   wAlbB). Wolbachia infections are thought to have spread by manipulating
   the reproduction of their hosts; cytoplasmic incompatibility is the
   mechanism used by Wolbachia to invade natural populations of many
   insects including Ae. albopictus. Here, we report a study on the effects
   of removing Wolbachia from Ae. albopictus on CHIKV replication and
   examine the consequences of CHIKV infection on some life-history traits
   (survival and reproduction) of Wolbachia-free Ae. albopictus. We found
   that Wolbachia-free mosquitoes maintained a highly heterogeneous CHIKV
   replication compared to Wolbachia-infected individuals. In
   Wolbachia-infected Ae. albopictus, the regular increase of CHIKV
   followed by a steady viral load from day 4 post-infection onwards was
   concomitant with a decline in Wolbachia density. This profile was also
   detected when examining the two key organs for viral transmission, the
   midgut and the salivary glands. Moreover, Wolbachia-free Ae. albopictus
   was not altered in life-history traits such as survival, oviposition and
   hatching characteristics whether infected or not with CHIKV. We found
   that Wolbachia is not essential for viral replication, its presence
   could lead to optimize replication from day 4 post-infection onwards,
   coinciding with a decrease in Wolbachia density. Wolbachia may regulate
   viral replication in Ae. albopictus, with consequences on survival and
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Potato late blight is an example of a re-emerging disease of plants.
   Phytophthora infestans was first introduced into Europe during the 19th
   century, where it caused the Irish potato famine. During the 20th
   century several additional introduction events have been suspected,
   especially in the mid-70s due to the import of large quantities of
   potato needed after the shortage caused by drought in 1976. Here, we
   investigate the genetic population structure of Phytophthora infestans,
   at the first stages of a recent invasion process in France. A total of
   220 isolates was collected from 20 commercial fields of the potato
   susceptible cultivar Bintje, during two consecutive years (2004 and
   2005). Clustering analyses based on eight recently developed
   microsatellite markers reveal that French P. infestans populations are
   made of two differentiated genetic clusters of isolates (F(ST) = 0.19).
   This result suggests multiple introductions of P. infestans into France,
   either through the introduction of a composite population of isolates or
   through the successive introduction of isolates having differentiated
   genetic backgrounds. Both clusters identified have a strong clonal
   structure and are similar regarding genetic diversity and mating type
   composition. The maintenance of differentiation between the two genetic
   clusters should result from the low or non-existent contribution of
   sexual reproduction in French P. infestans populations.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study compared the effect of heat stress on coral-associated
   bacterial communities among juveniles of the coral, Acropora tenuis,
   hosting different Symbiodinium types. In comparison to a control
   temperature treatment (28 degrees C), we documented dramatic changes in
   bacterial associates on juvenile corals harbouring ITS 1 type D
   Symbiodinium when placed in a high (32 degrees C) temperature treatment.
   In particular, there was a marked increase in the number of retrieved
   Vibrio affiliated sequences, which coincided with a 44\% decline in the
   photochemical efficiency of the D-juveniles. Interestingly, these Vibrio
   sequences affiliated most closely with the coral pathogen, Vibrio
   coralliilyticus, which has been implicated in some coral disease
   outbreaks. In contrast, A. tenuis hosting ITS 1 type C1 Symbiodinium did
   not exhibit major bacterial shifts in the elevated temperature
   treatment, indicating a more stable bacterial community during thermal
   stress; concomitantly a decline (10\%) in photochemical efficiency was
   minimal for this group. D juveniles that had been exposed to moderately
   elevated sea temperatures (30 degrees C) in the field before being
   placed in the control temperature treatment displayed a decrease in the
   number of Vibrio affiliated sequences and bacterial profiles shifted to
   become more similar to profiles of corals harbouring type C1
   Symbiodinium. In combination, these results demonstrate that thermal
   stress can result in shifts in coral-associated bacterial communities,
   which may lead to deteriorating coral health. The lower resilience of A.
   tenuis to thermal stress when harbouring Symbiodinium D highlights the
   importance of inter-kingdom interactions among the coral host,
   dinoflagellate endosymbiont and bacterial associates for coral health
   and resilience.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeography of speciation remains a controversial issue and the
   process of allopatric speciation reigns. Sympatric speciation differs
   from allopatric speciation in terms of geographic setting and the role
   of selection in bringing about reproductive isolating mechanisms, making
   it a particularly fascinating and controversial subject for evolutionary
   biologists. Mayr (1947) explained the difference eloquently: for
   allopatric speciation, populations spatially diverge and then become
   reproductively isolated; for sympatric speciation, populations first
   become reproductively isolated and then diverge. Because of this,
   sympatric speciation is difficult to show empirically and most
   evolutionary biologists agree that strict ecological, evolutionary, and
   geographic criteria must be met (Coyne \& Orr 2004). In this issue, Crow
   et al. (2010) challenge us to expand the definition of sympatric
   speciation by studying species of marine fishes that they propose have
   arisen by sympatric speciation in a setting that does not appear to
   conform to the usual geographical criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, is a large, cosmopolitan,
   coastal species. Females are thought to show philopatry to nursery
   grounds while males potentially migrate long distances, creating an
   opportunity for male-mediated gene flow that may lead to discordance in
   patterns revealed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers.
   While this dynamic has been investigated in elasmobranchs over small
   spatial scales, it has not been examined at a global level. We examined
   patterns of historical phylogeography and contemporary gene flow by
   genotyping 329 individuals from nine locations throughout the species'
   range at eight nuclear microsatellite markers and sequencing the
   complete mtDNA control region. Pairwise comparisons often resulted in
   fixation indices and divergence estimates of greater magnitude using
   mtDNA sequence data than microsatellite data. In addition, multiple
   methods of estimation suggested fewer populations based on
   microsatellite loci than on mtDNA sequence data. Coalescent analyses
   suggest divergence and restricted migration among Hawaii, Taiwan,
   eastern and western Australia using mtDNA sequence data and no
   divergence and high migration rates, between Taiwan and both Australian
   sites using microsatellite data. Evidence of secondary contact was
   detected between several localities and appears to be discreet in time
   rather than continuous. Collectively, these data suggest complex
   spatial/temporal relationships between shark populations that may
   feature pulses of female dispersal and more continuous male-mediated
   gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The life-history strategies of some species make them strong candidates
   for rapid exploitation of novel habitat under new climate regimes. Some
   early-responding species may be considered invasive, and negatively
   impact on `naive' ecosystems. The barrens-forming sea urchin
   Centrostephanus rodgersii is one such species, having a high dispersal
   capability and a high-latitude range margin limited only by a
   developmental temperature threshold. Within this species' range in
   eastern Australian waters, sea temperatures have increased at greater
   than double the global average rate. The coinciding poleward range
   extension of C. rodgersii has caused major ecological changes,
   threatening reef biodiversity and fisheries productivity. We
   investigated microsatellite diversity and population structure
   associated with range expansion by this species. Generalized linear
   model analyses revealed no reduction in genetic diversity in the newly
   colonized region. A `seascape genetics' analysis of genetic distances
   found no spatial genetic structure associated with the range extension.
   The distinctive genetic characteristic of the extension zone populations
   was reduced population-specific F(ST), consistent with very rapid
   population expansion. Demographic and genetic simulations support our
   inference of high connectivity between pre- and post-extension zones.
   Thus, the range shift appears to be a poleward extension of the
   highly-connected rangewide population of C. rodgersii. This is
   consistent with advection of larvae by the intensified warm water East
   Australian current, which has also increased Tasmanian Sea temperatures
   above the species' lower developmental threshold. Thus, ocean
   circulation changes have improved the climatic suitability of novel
   habitat for C. rodgersii and provided the supply of recruits necessary
   for colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Supportive breeding and stocking performed with non-native or
   domesticated fish to support sport fishery industry is a common practice
   throughout the world. Such practices are likely to modify the genetic
   integrity of natural populations depending on the extent of genetic
   differences between domesticated and wild fish and on the intensity of
   stocking. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of variable
   stocking intensities on patterns of genetic diversity and population
   differentiation among nearly 2000 brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   from 24 lakes located in two wildlife reserves in Quebec, Canada. Our
   results indicated that the level of genetic diversity was increased in
   more intensively stocked lakes, mainly due to the introduction of new
   alleles of domestic origin. As a consequence, the population genetic
   structure was strongly homogenized by intense stocking. Heavily stocked
   lakes presented higher admixture levels and lower levels of among lakes
   genetic differentiation than moderately and un-stocked lakes. Moreover,
   the number of stocking events explained the observed pattern of
   population genetic structure as much as hydrographical connections among
   lakes in each reserve. We discuss the implications for the conservation
   of exploited fish populations and the management of stocking practices.}},

Abstract = {{The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a keystone
   species on the mid- and short-grass prairies of North America. The
   species has suffered extensive colony extirpations and isolation as a
   result of human activity including the introduction of an exotic
   pathogen, Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of sylvatic plague. The
   prairie dog flea, Oropsylla hirsuta, is the most common flea on our
   study colonies in north-central Montana and it has been shown to carry
   Y. pestis. We used microsatellite markers to estimate the level of
   population genetic concordance between black-tailed prairie dogs and O.
   hirsuta in order to determine the extent to which prairie dogs are
   responsible for dispersing this potential plague vector among prairie
   dog colonies. We sampled fleas and prairie dogs from six prairie dog
   colonies in two regions separated by about 46 km. These colonies were
   extirpated by a plague epizootic that began months after our sampling
   was completed in 2005. Prairie dogs showed significant
   isolation-by-distance and a tendency toward genetic structure on the
   regional scale that the fleas did not. Fleas exhibited higher estimated
   rates of gene flow among prairie dog colonies than the prairie dogs
   sampled from the same colonies. While the findings suggested
   black-tailed prairie dogs may have contributed to flea dispersal, we
   attributed the lack of concordance between the population genetic
   structures of host and ectoparasite to additional flea dispersal that
   was mediated by mammals other than prairie dogs that were present in the
   prairie system.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species are ideal model systems to investigate the evolutionary
   processes associated with their ecological success by comparison with
   closely related species. In this article, we explore transcriptome
   evolution following divergence between two closely related salt-marsh
   species, the invasive Spartina alterniflora (native to the East-American
   Atlantic coast, introduced in several continents) and the declining
   Spartina maritima (native to the Euro-African Atlantic coast). We have
   explored the utility of cross-species hybridization microarrays using
   rice (Oryza sativa) oligo-microarrays to compare leaf expression
   patterns between these species. Coding sequence comparisons from 10
   nuclear genes (2256 bp) revealed that nucleotide divergence between
   Spartina and Oryza range from 8\% to 14\%. More than 70\% of the 60-mer
   oligonucleotide sequences spotted on the rice microarray exhibited
   stable and repeatable patterns when hybridized against Spartina RNA. In
   total, 9353 (44.5\%) genes on the array hybridized with both species S.
   maritima and S. alterniflora. Among these genes, 1247 genes were found
   to be differentially expressed between the two Spartina species, most of
   them (957) being up-regulated in S. alterniflora. In particular,
   developmental and cellular growth genes (gene ontology, biological
   process) were highly up-regulated in S. alterniflora and down-regulated
   in S. maritima, whereas genes involved in stress response were
   up-regulated in S. maritima. Our findings indicate the suitability of
   cross-species microarray hybridization between Spartina and O. sativa
   and reveal the extent of leaf transcriptome evolution that took place
   during the divergence between S. alterniflora and S. maritima.
   Expression patterns are consistent with the morphological
   differentiation and differential expansion of the two species.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory systems play crucial roles in survival and reproduction.
   Therefore, sensory plasticity has important evolutionary implications.
   In this study, we examined retinal plasticity in five species of cichlid
   fish from Lake Malawi. We compared the cone opsin expression profiles of
   wild-caught fish to lab-reared F(1) that had been raised in a UV minus,
   reduced intensity light environment. All of the opsin genes that were
   expressed in wild-caught fish were also expressed in lab-reared
   individuals. However, we found statistically significant differences in
   relative opsin expression among all five species. The most consistent
   difference was in the SWS2B (violet) opsin, which was always expressed
   at higher levels in lab-reared individuals. Estimates of visual pigment
   quantum catch suggest that this change in expression would increase
   retinal sensitivity in the light environment of the lab. We also found
   that the magnitude of plasticity varied across species. These findings
   have important implications for understanding the genetic regulation of
   opsin expression and raise many interesting questions about how the
   cichlid visual system develops. They also suggest that sensory
   plasticity may have facilitated the ecological diversification of
   cichlids in Lake Malawi.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to cool environments is a common feature in the core group of
   the grass subfamily Pooideae (Triticeae and Poeae). This suggest an
   ancient evolutionary origin of low temperature stress tolerance dating
   back prior to the initiation of taxonomic divergence of core Pooideae
   species. Viewing the Pooideae evolution in a palaeo-climatic perspective
   reveals that taxonomic divergence of the core Pooideae group initiated
   shortly after a global super-cooling period at the Eocene-Oligocene
   boundary (similar to 33.5-26 Ma). This global climate cooling altered
   distributions of plants and animals and must have imposed selection
   pressure for improved low temperature stress responses. Lineage-specific
   gene family expansions are known to be involved in adaptation to new
   environmental stresses. In Pooideae, two gene families involved in low
   temperature stress response, the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) and
   fructosyl transferase (FT) gene families, has undergone lineage-specific
   expansions. We investigated the timing of these gene family expansions
   by molecular dating and found that Pooideae-specific expansion events in
   CBF and FT gene families took place during Eocene-Oligocene
   super-cooling period. We hypothesize that the E-O super-cooling exerted
   selection pressure for improved low temperature stress response and
   frost tolerance in a core Pooideae ancestor, and that those individuals
   with multiple copies of CBF and FT genes were favoured.}},

Abstract = {{Sympatric speciation has been contentious since its inception, yet is
   increasingly recognized as important based on accumulating theoretical
   and empirical support. Here, we present a compelling case of sympatric
   speciation in a taxon of marine reef fishes using a comparative and
   mechanistic approach. Hexagrammos otakii and H. agrammus occur in
   sympatry throughout their ranges. Molecular sequence data from six loci,
   with complete sampling of the genus, support monophyly of these sister
   species. Although hybridization occurrs frequently with an allopatric
   congener in an area of slight distributional overlap, we found no F(1)
   hybrids between the focal sympatric taxa throughout their coextensive
   ranges. We present genetic evidence for complete reproductive isolation
   based on SNP analysis of 382 individuals indicating fixed polymorphisms,
   with no shared haplotypes or genotypes, between sympatric species. To
   address questions of speciation, we take a mechanistic approach and
   directly compare aspects of reproductive isolation between allopatric
   and sympatric taxa both in nature and in the laboratory. We conclude
   that the buildup of reproductive isolation is strikingly different in
   sympatric vs. allopatric taxa, consistent with theoretical predictions.
   Lab reared hybrids from allopatric species crosses exhibit severe
   fitness effects in the F(1) or backcross generation. No intrinsic
   fitness effects are observed in F(1) hybrids from sympatric species
   pairs, however these treatments exhibited reduced fertilization success
   and complete pre-mating isolation is implied in nature because F(1)
   hybrid adults do not occur. Our study addresses limitations of previous
   studies and supports new criteria for inferring sympatric speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently diverged populations often exhibit incomplete reproductive
   isolation, with a low level of gene flow continuing between populations.
   Previous studies have shown that, even under a low level of gene flow,
   genetic divergence between populations can proceed at the loci governing
   local adaptation and reproductive isolation but not at other neutral
   loci. A leaf-mining moth, Acrocercops transecta, consists of Juglans-
   and Lyonia-associated host races. The two host races differ in host
   preferences of ovipositing females and in larval adaptation to host
   plants but mate readily in the laboratory, producing fertile hybrids.
   The Juglans and Lyonia races are often sympatric in the wild, implying
   that gene introgression could occur in nature between the two host
   races. We tested this hypothesis by combining phylogenetic analyses with
   coalescent simulations, focusing on mitochondrial genes (COI and ND5)
   and the nuclear Tpi, Per and Ldh genes located on the Z-chromosome. The
   mitochondrial genes clearly distinguished the Lyonia race from the
   Juglnas race, whereas the Tpi, Per and Ldh genealogies did not reflect
   the two host races. Coalescent simulations indicated gene flow at the
   three Z-linked genes in both directions, whereas there was no
   introgression in the mitochondrial genes. The lack of introgression in
   mitochondrial genes suggests that female host preference is the primary
   force leading to the bifurcation of maternally inherited loci. Thus, the
   results show that a low level of gene flow coupled with the inflexible
   female host preference differentiates histories of divergence between
   maternally and biparentally inherited genes in this host race system.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analysis of a collection of rabies viruses that currently
   circulate in Canadian big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) identified five
   distinct lineages which have emerged from a common ancestor that existed
   over 400 years ago. Four of these lineages are regionally restricted in
   their range while the fifth lineage, comprising two-thirds of all
   specimens, has emerged in recent times and exhibits a recent demographic
   expansion with rapid spread across the Canadian range of its host. Four
   of these viral lineages are shown to circulate in the US. To explore the
   role of the big brown bat host in dissemination of these viral variants,
   the population structure of this species was explored using both
   mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers. These data suggest
   the existence of three subpopulations distributed in British Columbia,
   mid-western Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and eastern Canada (Quebec
   and Ontario), respectively. We suggest that these three bat
   subpopulations may differ by their level of female phylopatry, which in
   turn affects the spread of rabies viruses. We discuss how this bat
   population structure has affected the historical spread of rabies virus
   variants across the country and the potential impact of these events on
   public health concerns regarding rabies.}},

Abstract = {{The estimates of contemporary gene flow assessed based on naturally
   established seedlings provide information much needed for understanding
   the abilities of forest tree populations to persist under global changes
   through migration and/or adaptation facilitated by gene exchange among
   populations. Here, we investigated pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow
   in two mixed-oak forest stands (consisting of Quercus robur L. and Q.
   petraea {[}Matt.] Liebl.). The gene flow parameters were estimated based
   on microsatellite multilocus genotypes of seedlings and adults and their
   spatial locations within the sample plots using models that attempt to
   reconstruct the genealogy of the seedling cohorts. Pollen and seed
   dispersal were modelled using the standard seedling neighbourhood model
   and a modification-the 2-component seedling neighbourhood model, with
   the later allowing separation of the dispersal process into local and
   long-distance components. The 2-component model fitted the data
   substantially better than the standard model and provided estimates of
   mean seed and pollen dispersal distances accounting for long-distance
   propagule dispersal. The mean distance of effective pollen dispersal was
   found to be 298 and 463 m, depending on the stand, while the mean
   distance of effective seed dispersal was only 8.8 and 15.6 m, which is
   consistent with wind pollination and primarily seed dispersal by gravity
   in Quercus. Some differences observed between the two stands could be
   attributed to the differences in the stand structure of the adult
   populations and the existing understory vegetation. Such a mixture of
   relatively limited seed dispersal with occasional long distance gene
   flow seems to be an efficient strategy for colonizing new habitats with
   subsequent local adaptation, while maintaining genetic diversity within
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Whitefish, genus Coregonus, show exceptional levels of phenotypic
   diversity with sympatric morphs occurring in numerous postglacial lakes
   in the northern hemisphere. Here, we studied the effects of
   human-induced eutrophication on sympatric whitefish morphs in the Swiss
   lake, Lake Thun. In particular, we addressed the questions whether
   eutrophication (i) induced hybridization between two ecologically
   divergent summer-spawning morphs through a loss of environmental
   heterogeneity, and (ii) induced rapid adaptive morphological changes
   through changes in the food web structure. Genetic analysis based on 11
   microsatellite loci of 282 spawners revealed that the pelagic and the
   benthic morph represent highly distinct gene pools occurring at
   different relative proportions on all seven known spawning sites. Gill
   raker counts, a highly heritable trait, showed nearly discrete
   distributions for the two morphs. Multilocus genotypes characteristic of
   the pelagic morph had more gill rakers than genotypes characteristic of
   benthic morph. Using Bayesian methods, we found indications of recent
   but limited introgressive hybridization. Comparisons with historical
   gill raker data yielded median evolutionary rates of 0.24 haldanes and
   median selection intensities of 0.27 for this trait in both morphs for
   1948-2004 suggesting rapid evolution through directional selection at
   this trait. However, phenotypic plasticity as an alternative explanation
   for this phenotypic change cannot be discarded. We hypothesize that both
   the temporal shifts in mean gill raker counts and the recent
   hybridization reflect responses to changes in the trophic state of the
   lake induced by pollution in the 1960s, which created novel selection
   pressures with respect to feeding niches and spawning site preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Plant chemistry can strongly influence interactions between herbivores
   and their natural enemies, either by providing volatile compounds that
   serve as foraging cues for parasitoids or predators, or by affecting the
   quality of herbivores as hosts or prey. Through these effects plants may
   influence parasitoid population genetic structure. We tested for a
   possible specialization on specific crop plants in Chelonus insularis
   and Campoletis sonorensis, two primary parasitoids of the fall armyworm,
   Spodoptera frugiperda. Throughout Mexico, S. frugiperda larvae were
   collected from their main host plants, maize and sorghum and parasitoids
   that emerged from the larvae were used for subsequent comparison by
   molecular analysis. Genetic variation at eight and 11 microsatellites
   were respectively assayed for C. insularis and C. sonorensis to examine
   isolation by distance, host plant and regional effects. Kinship analyses
   were also performed to assess female migration among host-plants. The
   analyses showed considerable within population variation and revealed a
   significant regional effect. No effect of host plant on population
   structure of either of the two parasitoid species was found. Isolation
   by distance was observed at the individual level, but not at the
   population level. Kinship analyses revealed significantly more
   genetically related-or kin-individuals on the same plant species than on
   different plant species, suggesting that locally, mothers preferentially
   stay on the same plant species. Although the standard population
   genetics parameters showed no effect of plant species on population
   structure, the kinship analyses revealed that mothers exhibit plant
   species fidelity, which may speed up divergence if adaptation were to
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{Since the days of allozyme analysis, we have been enamored with the idea
   that if we just had enough polymorphic mendelian loci, we could gauge
   the inbreeding level of individuals by measuring heterozygosity and

   of individuals. Given Mendel's Laws, we have always known that we would
   need numerous independently segregating loci to achieve any reasonable
   degree of accuracy. Santure et al. (2010, this issue) use a 771 marker
   SNP panel to assess heterozygosity levels and to assess pairwise
   relatedness, and compare both with theoretical expectations obtained
   from a carefully recorded pedigree of a zebra finch breeding colony, as
   a function of increasing numbers of SNP markers. They also compare the
   SNP results with those from a 20-locus microsatellite panel, showing
   that adding SNPs to a fairly large microsatellite panel improves
   accuracy, but given an existing panel of 125 SNPs, little is to be
   gained by adding microsatellites. They show that the accuracy available
   for estimating individual levels of inbreeding is somewhat limited. They
   also show that the average pairwise relatedness measures bracket
   pedigree relationship very nicely, but the variances for individual
   pairs remain substantial, even with a very large panel.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the identities and characteristics of genes that govern the
   dramatic phenotypic differences between cultivated plants and their wild
   ancestors has greatly enhanced our understanding of the domestication
   process. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sigmon \& Vollbrecht report
   the discovery of a new maize domestication gene, ramosa1, which encodes
   a putative transcription factor in the ramosa developmental pathway.
   Ramosa1 appears to be instrumental in determining the straightness of
   kernel rows on the maize cob. The key domestication alleles at ramosa1
   are prevalent in landraces of maize. These results reinforce findings
   from previous studies of crop evolution by highlighting the importance
   of standing genetic variation and changes in transcriptional regulators
   in domestication. The evolutionary genetics of domestication also
   provides a framework for predicting the evolutionary response of
   organisms to strong human-induced selection pressures over limited time

Abstract = {{When studying selection during adaptation to novel environments,
   researchers have often paid little attention to an organism's earliest
   developmental stages. Despite this lack of attention, early life history
   traits may be under strong selection during colonization, as the
   expression of adaptive phenotypes at later points is contingent upon
   early survival. Moreover, the timing of early developmental transitions
   can constrain the timing of later transitions, with potentially large
   effects on fitness. In this issue, Huang et al. (2010) underscore the
   importance of early life history traits in the adaptation of Arabidopsis
   thaliana to old-field sites in North America. Using a new population of
   mapped recombinant inbred lines, the authors examined germination timing
   and total lifetime fitness of A. thaliana while varying site latitude,
   dispersal season, and maternal photoperiod. Huang et al. (2010)
   discovered several Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) with large effects on
   fitness that colocalized with QTL for field germination timing and seed
   dormancy-demonstrating that fitness is genetically associated with these
   early life history traits, and that these loci are likely under strong
   selection during adaptation to novel environments. In the epistatic
   interactions of some loci, recombinant genotypes outperformed parental
   genotypes, supporting the potentially adaptive role of recombination.
   This study provides elegant evidence that traits expressed early in an
   organism's development can play an important role during adaptive
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Using Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as a model system, we investigated

   immune-relevant loci more frequently exhibit footprints of selection
   than other loci. They also indicate that the correlation between

Abstract = {{Organisms often respond to environmental changes by producing
   alternative phenotypes. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation may
   contribute to environmentally induced phenotypic variation by modifying
   gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation, unlike DNA mutations, can
   be influenced by the environment; they are stable at the time scale of
   an individual and present different levels of heritability. These
   characteristics make DNA methylation a potentially important molecular
   process to respond to environmental change. The aim of this review is to
   present the implications of DNA methylation on phenotypic variations
   driven by environmental changes. More specifically, we explore
   epigenetic concepts concerning phenotypic change in response to the
   environment and heritability of DNA methylation, namely the Baldwin
   effect and genetic accommodation. Before addressing this point, we
   report major differences in DNA methylation across taxa and the role of
   this modification in producing and maintaining environmentally induced
   phenotypic variation. We also present the different methods allowing the
   detection of methylation polymorphism. We believe this review will be
   helpful to molecular ecologists, in that it highlights the importance of
   epigenetic processes in ecological and evolutionary studies.}},

Abstract = {{Modern maize was domesticated from Zea mays parviglumis, a teosinte,
   about 9000 years ago in Mexico. Genes thought to have been selected upon
   during the domestication of crops are commonly known as domestication
   loci. The ramosa1 (ra1) gene encodes a putative transcription factor
   that controls branching architecture in the maize tassel and ear.
   Previous work demonstrated reduced nucleotide diversity in a segment of
   the ra1 gene in a survey of modern maize inbreds, indicating that
   positive selection occurred at some point in time since maize diverged
   from its common ancestor with the sister species Tripsacum dactyloides
   and prompting the hypothesis that ra1 may be a domestication gene. To
   investigate this hypothesis, we examined ear phenotypes resulting from
   minor changes in ra1 activity and sampled nucleotide diversity of ra1
   across the phylogenetic spectrum between tripsacum and maize, including
   a broad panel of teosintes and unimproved maize landraces. Weak mutant
   alleles of ra1 showed subtle effects in the ear, including crooked rows
   of kernels due to the occasional formation of extra spikelets,
   correlating a plausible, selected trait with subtle variations in gene
   activity. Nucleotide diversity was significantly reduced for maize
   landraces but not for teosintes, and statistical tests implied
   directional selection on ra1 consistent with the hypothesis that ra1 is
   a domestication locus. In maize landraces, a noncoding 3'-segment
   contained almost no genetic diversity and 5'-flanking diversity was
   greatly reduced, suggesting that a regulatory element may have been a
   target of selection.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term persistence of forest-dwelling caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou) will probably be determined by management and conservation
   decisions. Understanding the evolutionary relationships between modern
   caribou herds, and how these relationships have changed through time
   will provide key information for the design of appropriate management
   strategies. To explore these relationships, we amplified microsatellite
   and mitochondrial markers from modern caribou from across the Southern
   Yukon, Canada, as well as mitochondrial DNA from Holocene specimens
   recovered from alpine ice patches in the same region. Our analyses
   identify a genetically distinct group of caribou composed of herds from
   the Southern Lakes region that may warrant special management
   consideration. We also identify a partial genetic replacement event
   occurring 1000 years before present, coincident with the deposition of
   the White River tephra and the Medieval Warm Period. These results
   suggest that, in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures and
   climate variability, maintaining the ability of caribou herds to expand
   in numbers and range may be more important than protecting the survival
   of any individual, isolated sedentary forest-dwelling herd.}},

Abstract = {{The Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) is one of the dominant and
   most widespread herbivores in sub-Saharan Africa. High levels of genetic
   diversity and exceptionally low levels of population differentiation
   have been found in the Cape buffalo compared to other African savannah
   ungulates. Patterns of genetic variation reveal large effective
   population sizes and indicate that Cape buffalos have historically been
   interbreeding across considerable distances. Throughout much of its
   range, the Cape buffalo is now largely confined to protected areas due
   to habitat fragmentation and increasing human population densities,
   possibly resulting in genetic erosion. Ten buffalo populations in Kenya
   and Uganda were examined using seventeen microsatellite markers to
   assess the regional genetic structure and the effect of protected area
   size on measures of genetic diversity. Two nested levels of genetic
   structure were identified: a higher level partitioning populations into
   two clusters separated by the Victoria Nile and a lower level
   distinguishing seven genetic clusters, each defined by one or two study
   populations. Although relatively small geographic distances separate
   most of the study populations, the level of genetic differentiation
   found here is comparable to that among pan-African populations. Overall,
   correlations between conservancy area and indices of genetic diversity
   suggest buffalo populations inhabiting small parks are showing signs of
   genetic erosion, stressing the need for more active management of such
   populations. Our findings raise concerns about the future of other
   African savannah ungulates with lower population sizes and inferior
   dispersal capabilities compared with the buffalo.}},

Abstract = {{Colonizing species may often encounter strong selection during the
   initial stages of adaptation to novel environments. Such selection is
   particularly likely to act on traits expressed early in development
   since early survival is necessary for the expression of adaptive
   phenotypes later in life. Genetic studies of fitness under field
   conditions, however, seldom include the earliest developmental stages.
   Using a new set of recombinant inbred lines, we present a study of the
   genetic basis of fitness variation in Arabidopsis thaliana in which
   genotypes, environments, and geographic location were manipulated to
   study total lifetime fitness, beginning with the seed stage.
   Large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fitness changed allele
   frequency and closely approached 90\% in some treatments within a single
   generation. These QTLs colocated with QTLs for germination phenology
   when seeds were dispersed following a schedule of a typical winter
   annual, and they were detected in two geographic locations at different
   latitudes. Epistatically interacting loci affected both fitness and
   germination in many cases. QTLs for field germination phenology
   colocated with known QTLs for primary dormancy induction as assessed in
   laboratory tests, including the candidate genes DOG1 and DOG6. Therefore
   fitness, germination phenology, and primary dormancy are genetically
   associated at the level of specific chromosomal regions and candidate
   loci. Genes associated with the ability to arrest development at early
   life stages and assess environmental conditions are thereby likely
   targets of intense natural selection early in the colonization process.}},

Abstract = {{Instances of hybridization between mammalian taxa in the wild are rarely
   documented. To test for introgression between sibling species of
   horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus yunanensis and R. pearsoni) and two
   subspecies of the latter (R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis), we
   sequenced two mtDNA and two ncDNA markers in individuals sampled from
   multiple localities within their overlapping ranges. The interspecific
   mtDNA gene tree corresponded to the expected taxonomic divisions, and
   coalescent-based analyses suggested divergence occurred around 4 MYA.
   However, these relationships strongly conflicted with those recovered
   from two independent nuclear gene trees, in which R. yunanensis
   clustered with R. p. pearsoni to the exclusion of R. p. chinensis. This
   geographically widespread discordance is best explained by large-scale
   historical introgression of ncDNA from R. yunanensis to R. pearsoni by
   male-mediated exchange in mixed species colonies during Pleistocene
   glacial periods, when ranges may have contracted and overlapped more
   than at present. Further species tree-gene tree conflicts were detected
   between R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis, also indicating past and/or
   current introgression in their overlapping regions. However, here the
   patterns point to asymmetric mtDNA introgression without ncDNA
   introgression. Analyses of coalescence times indicate this exchange has
   occurred subsequent to the divergence of these subspecies from their
   common ancestor. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple
   data sets for reconstructing phylogeographic histories and resolving
   taxonomic relationships.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies within plant genera have found geographically
   structured sharing of chloroplast (cp) DNA among sympatric species,
   consistent with introgressive hybridization. Current research is aimed
   at understanding the extent, direction and significance of nuclear (nr)
   DNA exchange that accompanies putative cpDNA exchange. Eucalyptus is a
   complex tree genus for which cpDNA sharing has been established between
   multiple species. Prior phylogeographic analysis has indicated cpDNA
   introgression into the widespread forest species Eucalyptus globulus
   from its rare congener E. cordata. In this study, we use AFLP markers to
   characterize corresponding nrDNA introgression, on both a broad and fine
   spatial scale. Using 388 samples we examine (i) the fine-scale spatial
   structure of cp and nrDNA introgression from E. cordata into E. globulus
   at a site in natural forest and (ii) broad-scale patterns of AFLP marker
   introgression at six additional mixed populations. We show that while E.
   globulus and E. cordata retain strongly differentiated nuclear gene
   pools overall, leakage of nrDNA occurs at mixed populations, with some
   AFLP markers being transferred to E. globulus recurrently at different
   sites. On the fine scale, different AFLP fragments show varying
   distances of introgression into E. globulus, while introgression of
   cpDNA is extensive. The frequency of E. cordata markers in E. globulus
   is correlated with spatial proximity to E. cordata, but departs from
   expectations based on AFLP marker frequency in E. cordata, indicating
   that selection may be governing the persistence of introgressed
   fragments in E. globulus.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of a comparative approach makes it impossible to determine the
   main factors influencing colonization and evolution in plants. Here we
   conducted the first comparative study of a characteristic Mediterranean
   lineage (white-flowered Cistus) taking advantage of its well-known
   phylogenetic relationships. A two-scale approach was applied to address
   the hypothesis of higher levels of isolation in mountain than in lowland
   species. First, a time-calibrated phylogeny using plastid sequences of
   Cistaceae suggested that the origin of Cistus species postdated both the
   refilling of the Mediterranean Sea (5.59-5.33 Ma) and the onset of the
   Mediterranean climate (3.2 Ma). Two hundred and sixty-three additional,
   plastid sequences from 111 populations showed different numbers of
   haplotypes in C. laurifolius (7), C. monspeliensis (2) and C.
   salviifolius (7). Although haplotype sharing among disjunct populations
   was observed in all species, phylogeographic analyses revealed haplotype
   lineages exclusive to Europe or Africa only in the mountain species (C.
   laurifolius). Isolation by either geographical distance or sea barriers
   was not significantly supported for the lowland species (C.
   monspeliensis; C. ladanifer from a previous study). The same is true for
   the less habitat-specific species of the lineage (C. salviifolius).
   Comparative phylogeography of the Cistus species leads us to interpret a
   general pattern of active colonization surpassing Mediterranean
   barriers. In contrast, ecological conditions (precipitation,
   temperature, soils) appear to have determined the distribution of the
   Cistus species of Mediterranean mountains. This study further provides
   molecular evidence for multiple colonization patterns in the course of
   successful adaptation of Cistus species to Mediterranean habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary climatic fluctuations have left contrasting historical
   footprints on the neutral genetic diversity patterns of existing
   populations of different tree species. We should expect the demography,
   and consequently the neutral genetic structure, of taxa less tolerant to
   particular climatic extremes to be more sensitive to long-term climate
   fluctuations. We explore this hypothesis here by sampling all six pine
   species found in the Iberian Peninsula (2464 individuals, 105
   populations), using a common set of chloroplast microsatellite markers,
   and by looking at the association between neutral genetic diversity and
   species-specific climatic requirements. We found large variation in
   neutral genetic diversity and structure among Iberian pines, with
   cold-enduring mountain species (Pinus uncinata, P. sylvestris and P.
   nigra) showing substantially greater diversity than thermophilous taxa
   (P. pinea and P. halepensis). Within species, we observed a significant
   positive correlation between population genetic diversity and summer
   precipitation for some of the mountain pines. The observed pattern is
   consistent with the hypotheses that: (i) more thermophilous species have
   been subjected to stronger demographic fluctuations in the past, as a
   consequence of their maladaptation to recurrent glacial cold stages; and
   (ii) altitudinal migrations have allowed the maintenance of large
   effective population sizes and genetic variation in cold-tolerant
   species, especially in more humid regions. In the light of these results
   and hypotheses, we discuss some potential genetic consequences of
   impending climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The medicinal shrub Carapichea ipecacuanha (ipecac) is an amphitropic
   species with three disjunct areas of distribution. In the Brazilian
   Atlantic and Amazonian ranges, the species was associated mostly with
   the understory of seasonal semideciduous forests, whereas in the Central
   American-Colombian range, the species occurred in the understory of
   moist evergreen forests. We examined the phylogeographic structure of
   ipecac using chloroplast trnT-trnL and nuclear internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) sequences from 120 and 46 specimens, respectively. To
   complement existing data on root alkaloid profiles, we used
   high-performance liquid chromatography to assess the levels of emetine
   and cephaeline in 33 specimens from the two Brazilian ranges. The three
   ranges shared neither nuclear nor chloroplast haplotypes. The
   phylogeographic structures showed an uneven distribution of genetic
   diversity, sharp breaks and high levels of genetic differentiation among
   ranges. Our results suggest that the extant populations are descendents
   of at least four distinct ancestral lineages. The Atlantic ipecacs
   showed higher levels of genetic diversity than ipecacs from the other
   two ranges; it is likely that they derive from two ancestral lineages,
   with long-term persistence in that region. The Amazonian ipecacs were
   monomorphic with respect to the ITS and cpDNA sequences, which supports
   the view that there was a recent expansion from a single parental source
   after a strong genetic bottleneck. The existence of a fourth distinct
   lineage is apparent from the high levels of genetic and chemical
   differentiation that we identified in the Central American-Columbian
   ipecacs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the interplay of population demography with
   the evolution of ecological niches during or after speciation in
   Hordeum. While large populations maintain a high level of standing
   genetic diversity, gene flow and recombination buffers against fast
   alterations in ecological adaptation. Small populations harbour lower
   allele diversity but can more easily shift to new niches if they
   initially survive under changed conditions. Thus, large populations
   should be more conservative regarding niche changes in comparison to
   small populations. We used environmental niche modelling together with
   phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to infer
   the correlation of population demography with changes in ecological
   niche dimensions in 12 diploid Hordeum species from the New World,
   forming four monophyletic groups. Our analyses found both shifts and
   conservatism in distinct niche dimensions within and among clades.
   Speciation due to vicariance resulted in three species with no
   pronounced climate niche differences, while species originating due to
   long-distance dispersals or otherwise encountering genetic bottlenecks
   mostly revealed climate niche shifts. Niche convergence among clades
   indicates a niche-filling pattern during the last 2 million years in
   South American Hordeum. We provide evidence that species, which did not
   encounter population reductions mainly showed ecoclimatic niche
   conservatism, while major niche shifts occurred in species which have
   undergone population bottlenecks. Our data allow the conclusion that
   population demography influences adaptation and niche shifts or
   conservatism in South American Hordeum species.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the availability
   of high density genetic marker data for both model and non-model
   organisms. A potential application of these data is to infer relatedness
   in the absence of a complete pedigree. Using a marker panel of 771 SNPs
   genotyped in three generations of an extensive zebra finch pedigree,
   correlations between pedigree relatedness and seven marker-based
   estimates of relatedness were examined, as was the relationship between
   heterozygosity and inbreeding. Although marker-based and pedigree
   relatedness were highly correlated, the variance in estimated
   relatedness was high. Further, the correlation between heterozygosity
   and inbreeding was weak, even though mean inbreeding coefficient is
   typical of that seen in wild vertebrate pedigrees; the weak relationship
   was in part due to the small variance in inbreeding in the pedigree. Our
   data suggest that using marker information to reconstruct the pedigree,
   and then calculating relatedness from the pedigree, is likely to give
   more accurate relatedness estimates than using marker-based estimators
   directly.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1452-1461}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Honeybee hygienic behaviour provides colonies with protection from many
   pathogens and is an important model system of the genetics of a complex
   behaviour. It is a textbook example of complex behaviour under simple
   genetic control: hygienic behaviour consists of two components -
   uncapping a diseased brood cell, followed by removal of the contents -
   each of which are thought to be modulated independently by a few loci of
   medium to large effect. A worker's genetic propensity to engage in
   hygienic tasks affects the intensity of the stimulus required before she
   initiates the behaviour. Genetic diversity within colonies leads to task
   specialization among workers, with a minority of workers performing the
   majority of nest-cleaning tasks. We identify three quantitative trait
   loci that influence the likelihood that workers will engage in hygienic
   behaviour and account for up to 30\% of the phenotypic variability in
   hygienic behaviour in our population. Furthermore, we identify two loci
   that influence the likelihood that a worker will perform uncapping
   behaviour only, and one locus that influences removal behaviour. We
   report the first candidate genes associated with engaging in hygienic
   behaviour, including four genes involved in olfaction, learning and
   social behaviour, and one gene involved in circadian locomotion. These
   candidates will allow molecular characterization of this distinctive
   behavioural mode of disease resistance, as well as providing the
   opportunity for marker-assisted selection for this commercially
   significant trait.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effect of larval condition on adult immunity in
   holometabolous insects is rarely considered. We show here that larval
   food composition can impact adult immunity independent from effects on
   general condition of the animal. Rather, our data indicate a plastic
   allocation of resources to immunity in high-protein environments.
   Specifically, we found that increasing the nutritional yeast (protein)
   available to larval Drosophila melanogaster increased the adult's
   constitutive transcription of two genes encoding defensive antimicrobial
   peptides. Adult dry weight was not significantly affected by larval food
   composition, while adult fat content decreased when larval yeast
   increased. Larval immune activity was unaffected by alterations of
   larval diet, indicating a lack of covariation in this trait across
   life-stages. We conclude that the nutritional environment of insect
   larvae can affect adult immunity by influencing plastic allocation of
   resources. These influences are less predictable than constraints linked
   to general condition would be.}},

Abstract = {{The Agaricomycotina are a phylogenetically diverse group of fungi that
   includes both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal species, and that form
   species-rich communities in forest ecosystems. Most species are
   infrequently observed, and this hampers assessment of the role that
   environmental heterogeneity plays in determining local community
   composition and in driving b-diversity. We used a combination of
   phenetic (TRFLP) and phylogenetic approaches {[}Unifrac and Net
   Relatedness Index (NRI)] to examine the compositional and phylogenetic
   similarity of Agaricomycotina communities in forest floor and surface
   soil of three widely distributed temperate upland forest ecosystems
   (one, xeric oak-dominated and two, mesic sugar maple dominated).
   Generally, forest floor and soil communities had similar phylogenetic
   diversity, but there was little overlap of species or evolutionary
   lineages between these two horizons. Forest floor communities were
   dominated by saprotrophic species, and were compositionally and
   phylogenetically similar in all three ecosystems. Mycorrhizal species
   represented 30\% to 90\% of soil community diversity, and these
   communities differed compositionally and phylogenetically between
   ecosystems. Estimates of NRI revealed significant phylogenetic
   clustering in both the forest floor and soil communities of only the
   xeric oakdominated forest ecosystem, and may indicate that this
   ecosystem acts as a habitat filter. Our results suggest that
   environmental heterogeneity strongly influences the phylogenetic
   b-diversity of soil inhabiting Agaricomycotina communities, but has only
   a small influence on forest floor b-diversity. Moreover, our results
   suggest that the strength of community assembly processes, such as
   habitat filtering, may differ between temperate forest ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1483-1496}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ecological processes are manifest in the evolution and form of phenotype
   diversity. The great abundance of parasitoid species has led to
   speculation whether rates of speciation and extinction are dependent on
   parasitoid diversity. If these factors are mutually exclusive, species
   diversity should fluctuate instead of remaining relatively constant over
   time. It is not known whether radiations constrained by coevolutionary
   interactions conform to density-dependent diversification processes.
   Here we test the prediction that parasitoid fig wasp diversification
   responds to changes in ecological opportunity and density-independent
   processes. A phylogenetic approach is used to estimate relative
   divergence times and infer diversification rate changes using
   c-statistics. Monte Carlo constant rates tests that accommodate
   incomplete sampling could not reject constant rates diversification.
   Parasitoid fig wasp diversification is consistent with a more complex
   explanation than density-dependent cladogenesis. The results suggest
   contemporary African parasitoid fig wasp diversity remains a legacy of
   an ancient ecological opportunity facilitated by fig tree
   diversification following the breakup of Pan-African forests and
   evolution of the savanna biome over the last 55 Ma and the more recent
   aridification of the African continent in the last 5 Ma. These results
   imply that amplified phenotypic differentiation of specialist insects
   coevolving with plants is coupled to evolutionarily infrequent changes
   in ecological opportunity.}},

Abstract = {{Glomus intraradices, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), is
   frequently found in a surprisingly wide range of ecosystems all over the
   world. It is used as model organism for AMF and its genome is being
   sequenced. Despite the ecological importance of AMF, little has been
   known about their population structure, because no adequate molecular
   markers have been available. In the present study we analyse for the
   first time the intraspecific genetic structure of an AMF directly from
   colonized roots in the field. A recently developed PCR-RFLP approach for
   the mitochondrial rRNA large subunit gene (mtLSU) of these obligate
   symbionts was used and complemented by sequencing and primers specific
   for a particularly frequent mtLSU haplotype. We analysed root samples
   from two agricultural field experiments in Switzerland and two
   semi-natural grasslands in France and Switzerland. RFLP type composition
   of G. intraradices (phylogroup GLOM A-1) differed strongly between
   agricultural and semi-natural sites and the G. intraradices populations
   of the two agricultural sites were significantly differentiated. RFLP
   type richness was higher in the agricultural sites compared with the
   grasslands. Detailed sequence analyses which resolved multiple sequence
   haplotypes within some RFLP types even revealed that there was no
   overlap of haplotypes among any of the study sites except between the
   two grasslands. Our results demonstrate a surprisingly high
   differentiation among semi-natural and agricultural field sites for G.
   intraradices. These findings will have major implications on our views
   of processes of adaptation and specialization in these plant/fungus
   associations.}},

Abstract = {{Coral reefs are threatened with worldwide decline from multiple factors,
   chief among them climate change (Hughes et al. 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al. 2007). The foundation of coral reefs is an endosymbiosis between
   coral hosts and their resident photosynthetic dinoflagellates (genus
   Symbiodinium) and this partnership (or holobiont) is exquisitely
   sensitive to temperature stress. The primary response to hyperthermic
   stress is coral bleaching, which is the loss of symbionts from coral
   tissues-the collapse of the symbiosis (Weis 2008). Bleaching can result
   in increased coral mortality which can ultimately lead to severely
   compromised reef health (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Despite this grim
   picture of coral bleaching and reef degradation, coral susceptibility to
   stress and bleaching is highly variable (Coles \& Brown 2003). There is
   enormous interest in discovering the factors that determine
   susceptibility in order to help us predict if and how corals will
   survive a period of rapid global warming. In this issue, Barshis et al.
   (2010) examine the ecophysiological and genetic basis for differential
   responses to stress in Porites lobata in American Samoa. They combine a
   reciprocal transplant experimental design between two neighbouring, but
   very different reef environments with state-of-the-art physiological
   biomarkers and molecular genetic markers for both partners to tease
   apart the contribution of environmental and fixed influences on stress
   susceptibility. Their results suggest the presence of a fixed, rather
   than environmental effect on expression of ubiquitin conjugates, one key
   marker for physiological stress response. In addition, the authors show
   genetic differentiation in host populations between the two sites
   suggesting strong selection for physiological adaptation to differing
   environments across small geographic distances. These conclusions point
   the study of coral resilience and susceptibility in a new direction.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{1520-1522}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Theoretically, both balancing selection and genetic drift can contribute
   to the maintenance of gender polymorphism within and/or among
   populations. However, if strong differences exist among genotypes in the
   quantity of viable gametes they produce, then it is expected that these
   differences will play an important role in determining the relative
   frequency of the genotypes and contribute to whether or not such
   polymorphism is maintained. In this issue, De Cauwer et al. (2010)
   describe an investigation of gynodioecious wild sea beet, which in
   addition to containing females, contain two types of hermaphrodites:
   restored hermaphrodites carrying a cytoplasm that causes pollen
   sterility and a nuclear gene that restores pollen fertility, and
   hermaphrodites without the sterilizing cytoplasm. The results show that
   restored hermaphrodites, who have relatively low pollen viability,
   achieve disproportionately high siring success simply because of where
   they are located in a patchy population (Fig. 1). Notably, these
   individuals tend to be close to females because of the genetics of sex
   determination. These results indicate that population structure caused
   by drift processes can have an unexpectedly large effect on the fitness
   of these low quality hermaphrodites, thereby contributing in the short
   term to the maintenance of gynodioecy in this population. While these
   results indicate that population structure caused by drift processes can
   have a large effect on the relative fitness of genetic variants, whether
   these effects promote or discourage the maintenance of polymorphism in
   the long term is still up for debate.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1523-1539}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{One of the grand challenges of the postgenomics era is to
   mechanistically link the genotype with the phenotype. Here, we consider
   the link between the mitochondrial genotype and the organismal phenotype
   that is provided by bioenergetic studies of the electron transport
   chain. That linkage is pertinent for the fields of molecular ecology and
   phylogeography as it tests if, and potentially how, natural selection
   can influence the evolutionary and demographic past of both populations
   and species. We introduce the mitochondrial genotype in terms of
   mitochondrial-encoded genes, nuclear-encoded genes that produce
   structural proteins imported into the mitochondria, and mitochondrial
   DNA-nuclear interactions. We then review the potential for quaternary
   structure modelling to predict the functional consequence of specific
   naturally occurring mutations. We discuss how the energy-producing
   reactions of oxidative phosphorylation can be used to provide a
   mechanistic biochemical link between genotype and phenotype.
   Experimental manipulations can then be used to test the functional
   consequences of specific mutations in multiple genetic backgrounds.
   Finally, we examine how mitochondria can influence the organismal
   mitochondrial phenotype using the examples of lifespan, fertility and
   starvation resistance and discuss how mitochondria may be involved in
   establishing both the upper and lower thermal limits of organisms. We
   conclude that mitochondrial DNA mutations can be important in
   determining aspects of organism life history. The question that remains
   to be resolved is how common are these adaptive mutations?.}},

Abstract = {{Plant mating systems are known to influence population genetic structure
   because pollen and seed dispersal are often spatially restricted.
   However, the reciprocal outcomes of population structure on the dynamics
   of polymorphic mating systems have received little attention. In
   gynodioecious sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima), three sexual types
   co-occur: females carrying a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) gene,
   hermaphrodites carrying a non-CMS cytoplasm and restored hermaphrodites
   that carry CMS genes and nuclear restorer alleles. This study
   investigated the effects of fine-scale genetic structure on male
   reproductive success of the two hermaphroditic forms. Our study
   population was strongly structured and characterized by contrasting
   local sex-ratios. Pollen flow was constrained over short distances and
   depended on local plant density. Interestingly, restored hermaphrodites
   sired significantly more seedlings than non-CMS hermaphrodites, despite
   the previous observation that the former produce pollen of lower quality
   than the latter. This result was explained by the higher frequency of
   females in the local vicinity of restored (CMS) hermaphrodites as
   compared to non-CMS hermaphrodites. Population structure thus strongly
   influences individual fitness and may locally counteract the expected
   effects of selection, suggesting that understanding fine scale
   population processes is central to predicting the evolution of gender
   polymorphism in angiosperms.}},

Abstract = {{The newly introduced mosquito Aedes japonicus has expanded from its
   original range in Northeastern Asia to 29 US states (including Hawaii)
   plus Canada and northern Europe. Our objectives were to test an earlier
   hypothesis of multiple introductions of this species to the Northeastern
   US and evaluate putative temporal changes in genetic makeup. Using a
   panel of seven microsatellite loci, we confirmed the existence of two
   abundant genetic forms in specimens originally collected in 1999-2000
   (F(ST) value based on microsatellite data = 0.26) that matches the
   disjunctive distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes. To examine the
   distribution of the two genetic `types' across Pennsylvania we created a
   fine-scale genetic map of Ae. japonicus using 439 specimens collected
   from 54 Pennsylvania counties in 2002-2003. We also made direct
   comparisons between collections in 1999-2000 and new collections made in
   2004-2005 obtained from the same areas in the northeastern US. We
   observed that the strong association between mtDNA haplotype and
   microsatellite signature seen in 1999-2000 had weakened significantly by
   2002 across Pennsylvania, a trend continued to some extent in 2004-2005
   in PA, NJ, and NY, indicating that once easily distinguishable separate
   introductions are merging. The two expanding genetic forms create a
   complex correlation between spatial and genetic distances. The existence
   of multiple introductions would be obscured without sampling early and
   across time with highly polymorphic molecular markers. Our results
   provide a high-resolution analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics
   of a newly introduced disease vector and argue that successive
   introductions may be a common pattern for invasive mosquitoes.}},

Abstract = {{After introduction, West Nile virus (WNV) spread rapidly across the
   western United States between the years 2001 and 2004. This westward
   movement is thought to have been mediated by random dispersive movements
   of resident birds. Little attention has been placed on the role of
   mosquito vectors in virus dispersal across North America. The mosquito
   vector largely responsible for WNV amplification and transmission of WNV
   in the western USA is Culex tarsalis. Here we present population genetic
   data that suggest a potential role for C. tarsalis in the dispersal of
   WNV across the western USA. Population genetic structure across the
   species range of C. tarsalis in the USA was characterized in 16 states
   using 12 microsatellite loci. structure and geneland analyses indicated
   the presence of three broad population clusters. Barriers to gene flow
   were resolved near the Sonoran desert in southern Arizona and between
   the eastern Rocky Mountains and High Plains plateau. Small genetic
   distances among populations within clusters indicated that gene flow was
   not obstructed over large portions of the West Coast and within the
   Great Plains region. Overall, gene flow in C. tarsalis appears to be
   extensive, potentially mediated by movement of mosquitoes among
   neighbouring populations and hindered in geographically limited parts of
   its range. The pattern of genetic clustering in C. tarsalis is congruent
   with the pattern of invasion of WNV across the western United States,
   raising the possibility that movement of this important vector may be
   involved in viral dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{As range shifts coincident with climate change have become increasingly
   well documented, efforts to describe the causes of range boundaries have
   increased. Three mechanisms-genetic impoverishment, migration load, or a
   physical barrier to dispersal-are well described theoretically, but the
   data needed to distinguish among them have rarely been collected. We
   describe the distribution, abundance, genetic variation, and environment
   of Tetraclita rubescens, an intertidal barnacle that expanded its
   northern range limit by several hundreds of kilometres from San
   Francisco, CA, USA, since the 1970s. We compare geographic variation in
   abundance with abiotic and biotic patterns, including sea surface
   temperatures and the distributions of 387 co-occurring species, and
   describe genetic variation in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I,
   mitochondrial noncoding region, and nine microsatellite loci from 27
   locations between Bahia Magdalena (California Baja Sur, Mexico) and Cape
   Mendocino (CA, USA). We find very high gene flow, high genetic
   diversity, and a gradient in physical environmental variation coincident
   with the range limit. We infer that the primary cause of the northern
   range boundary in T. rubescens is migration load arising from flow of
   maladapted alleles into peripheral locations and that environmental
   change, which could have reduced selection against genotypes immigrating
   into the newly colonized portion of the range, is the most likely cause
   of the observed range expansion. Because environmental change could
   similarly affect all taxa in a region whose distributional limits are
   established by migration load, these mechanisms may be common causes of
   range boundaries and largely synchronous multi-species range expansions.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may strongly reduce individuals' dispersal among
   resource patches and hence influence population distribution and
   persistence. We studied the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the
   dispersal of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an
   endangered social lemur species living in a restricted and highly
   fragmented landscape. We combined spatial analysis and population
   genetics methods to describe population units and identify the
   environmental factors which best predict the rates and patterns of
   genetic differentiation within and between populations. We used
   non-invasive methods to genotype 230 individuals at 13 microsatellites
   in all the main forest fragments of its entire distribution area. Our
   analyses suggest that the Manankolana River and geographical distance
   are the primary structuring factors, while a national road crossing the
   region does not seem to impede gene flow. Altogether, our results are in
   agreement with a limited influence of forest habitat connectivity on
   gene flow patterns (except for North of the species' range), suggesting
   that dispersal is still possible today among most forest patches for
   this species. Within forest patches, we find that dispersal is mainly
   among neighbouring social groups, hence confirming previous behavioural
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Several Agave species have played an important ethnobotanical role since
   prehistory in Mesoamerica and semiarid areas to the north, including
   central Arizona. We examined genetic variation in relict Agave parryi
   populations northeast of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, remnants from
   anthropogenic manipulation over 600 years ago. We used both allozymes
   and microsatellites to compare genetic variability and structure in
   anthropogenically manipulated populations with putative wild
   populations, to assess whether they were actively cultivated or the
   result of inadvertent manipulation, and to determine probable source
   locations for anthropogenic populations. Wild populations were more
   genetically diverse than anthropogenic populations, with greater
   expected heterozygosity, polymorphic loci, effective number of alleles
   and allelic richness. Anthropogenic populations exhibited many traits
   indicative of past active cultivation: fixed heterozygosity for several
   loci in all populations (nonexistent in wild populations); fewer
   multilocus genotypes, which differed by fewer alleles; and greater
   differentiation among populations than was characteristic of wild
   populations. Furthermore, manipulated populations date from a period
   when changes in the cultural context may have favoured active
   cultivation near dwellings. Patterns of genetic similarity among
   populations suggest a complex anthropogenic history. Anthropogenic
   populations were not simply derived from the closest wild A. parryi
   stock; instead they evidently came from more distant, often more
   diverse, wild populations, perhaps obtained through trade networks in
   existence at the time of cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to new environments can start from new mutations or from
   standing variation already present in natural populations. Whether
   admixture constrains or facilitates adaptation from standing variation
   is largely unknown, especially in ecological keystone or foundation
   species. We examined patterns of neutral and adaptive population
   divergence in Populus tremula L., a widespread forest tree, using mapped
   molecular genetic markers. We detected the genetic signature of
   postglacial admixture between a Western and an Eastern lineage of P.
   tremula in Scandinavia, an area suspected to represent a zone of
   postglacial contact for many species of animals and plants. Stringent
   divergence-based neutrality tests provided clear indications for locally
   varying selection at the European scale. Six of 12 polymorphisms under
   selection were located less than 1 kb away from the nearest gene
   predicted by the Populus trichocarpa genome sequence. Few of these loci
   exhibited a signature of `selective sweeps' in diversity-based tests,
   which is to be expected if adaptation occurs primarily from standing
   variation. In Scandinavia, admixture explained genomic patterns of
   ancestry and the nature of clinal variation and strength of selection
   for bud set, a phenological trait of great adaptive significance in
   temperate trees, measured in a common garden trial. Our data provide a
   hitherto missing direct link between past range shifts because of
   climatic oscillations, and levels of standing variation currently
   available for selection and adaptation in a terrestrial foundation
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) is a temperate, coastal squaloid
   shark with an antitropical distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific
   oceans. The global population structure of this species is poorly
   understood, although individuals are known to undergo extensive
   migrations within coastal waters and across ocean basins. In this study,
   an analysis of the global population structure of the spiny dogfish was
   conducted using eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers and a
   566-bp fragment of the mitochondrial ND2 gene region. A low level of
   genetic divergence was found among collections from the Atlantic and
   South Pacific basins, whereas a high level of genetic divergence was
   found among Pacific Ocean collections. Two genetically distinct groups
   were recovered by both marker classes: one exclusive to North Pacific
   collections, and one including collections from the South Pacific and
   Atlantic locations. The strong genetic break across the equatorial
   Pacific coincides with major regional differences in the life-history
   characters of spiny dogfish, suggesting that spiny dogfish in areas on
   either side of the Pacific equator have been evolving independently for
   a considerable time. Phylogeographic analyses indicate that spiny
   dogfish populations had a Pacific origin, and that the North Atlantic
   was colonized as a result of a recent range expansion from the South
   American coast. Finally, the available data strongly argue for the
   taxonomic separation of the North Pacific spiny dogfish from S.
   acanthias and a re-evaluation of the specific status of S. acanthias is
   warranted.}},

Title = {{Using isolation-by-distance-based approaches to assess the barrier
   effect of linear landscape elements on badger (Meles meles) dispersal}},

Abstract = {{As the European badger (Meles meles) can be of conservation or
   management concern, it is important to have a good understanding of the
   species' dispersal ability. In particular, knowledge of landscape
   elements that affect dispersal can contribute to devising effective
   management strategies. However, the standard approach of using Bayesian
   clustering methods to correlate genetic discontinuities with landscape
   elements cannot easily be applied to this problem, as badger populations
   are often characterized by a strong confounding isolation-by-distance
   (IBD) pattern. We therefore developed a two-step method that compares
   the location of pairs of related badgers relative to a putative barrier
   and utilizes the expected spatial genetic structure characterized by IBD
   as a null model to test for the presence of a barrier. If a linear
   feature disrupts dispersal, the IBD pattern characterising pairs of
   individuals located on different sides of a putative barrier should
   differ significantly from the pattern obtained with pairs of individuals
   located on the same side. We used our new approach to assess the impact
   of rivers and roads of different sizes on badger dispersal in western
   England. We show that a large, wide river represented a barrier to
   badger dispersal and found evidence that a motorway may also restrict
   badger movement. Conversely, we did not find any evidence for small
   rivers and roads interfering with badger movement. One of the advantages
   of our approach is that potentially it can detect features that disrupt
   gene flow locally, without necessarily creating distinct identifiable
   genetic units.}},

Title = {{Hybridization and polyploidy as drivers of continuing evolution and

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy are pivotal processes in
   plant evolution and speciation. The fate of new hybrid and polyploid
   taxa is determined by their ability to reproduce either sexually or
   asexually. Hybrids and allopolyploids with odd chromosome numbers are
   frequently sterile but some establish themselves through asexual
   reproduction (vegetative or apomixis). This allows novel genotypes to
   become established by isolating them from gene flow and leads to complex
   patterns of variation. The genus Sorbus is a good example of taxonomic
   complexity arising from the combined effects of hybridization,
   polyploidy and apomixis. The Avon Gorge in South-west Britain contains
   the greatest diversity of Sorbus in Europe, with three endemic species
   and four putative endemic novel hybrids among its 15 native Sorbus taxa.
   We used a combination of nuclear microsatellite and chloroplast DNA
   markers to investigate the evolutionary relationships among these Sorbus
   taxa within the Avon Gorge. We confirm the genetic identity of putative
   novel taxa and show that hybridization involving sexual diploid species,
   primarily S. aria and S. torminalis and polyploid facultative apomictic
   species from subgenus Aria, has been responsible for generating this
   biodiversity. Importantly our data show that this creative evolutionary
   process is ongoing within the Avon Gorge. Conservation strategies for
   the rare endemic Sorbus taxa should therefore consider all Sorbus taxa
   within the Gorge and must strive to preserve this evolutionary process
   rather than simply the individual rare taxa that it produces.}},

Abstract = {{We used the Allium przewalskianum diploid-tetraploid complex on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) as a model to examine how this complex
   responded to the Quaternary climatic oscillations, and whether multiple
   autopolyploidizations have occurred. We sequenced five chloroplast DNA
   (cpDNA) fragments (accD-psaI, trnH-psbA, trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG and
   rpl16-intron) in 306 individuals (all of known ploidy level) from 48
   populations across the distribution of this species complex. We
   identified a total of 32 haplotypes-11 in diploids only, 13 in
   tetraploids only, and 8 found in both cytotypes. This, plus network
   analyses, indicated that tetraploids have arisen independently from
   diploids at least eight times. Most populations in the eastern QTP
   contained multiple haplotypes, but only a single haplotype was found for
   17 tetraploid populations on the western QTP, suggesting a recent
   colonization of the western QTP. We further found that this species
   complex underwent an earlier range expansion around 5-150 thousand years
   ago (kya), after the largest glacial period (800-170 kya) in the QTP. In
   addition, the high frequencies of tetraploids in the QTP suggested that
   the tetraploid A. przewalskianum cytotype has evolutionary advantages
   over diploids in colonizing and/or surviving the arid habitats of the
   QTP.}},

Abstract = {{The degree to which coral reef ecosystems will be impacted by global
   climate change depends on regional and local differences in corals'
   susceptibility and resilience to environmental stressors. Here, we
   present data from a reciprocal transplant experiment using the common
   reef building coral Porites lobata between a highly fluctuating back
   reef environment that reaches stressful daily extremes, and a more
   stable, neighbouring forereef. Protein biomarker analyses assessing
   physiological contributions to stress resistance showed evidence for
   both fixed and environmental influence on biomarker response. Fixed
   influences were strongest for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins with
   consistently higher levels found in back reef source colonies both pre
   and post-transplant when compared with their forereef conspecifics.
   Additionally, genetic comparisons of back reef and forereef populations
   revealed significant population structure of both the nuclear ribosomal
   and mitochondrial genomes of the coral host (F(ST) = 0.146 P < 0.0001,
   F(ST) = 0.335 P < 0.0001 for rDNA and mtDNA, respectively), whereas
   algal endosymbiont populations were genetically indistinguishable
   between the two sites. We propose that the genotype of the coral host
   may drive limitations to the physiological responses of these corals
   when faced with new environmental conditions. This result is important
   in understanding genotypic and environmental interactions in the coral
   algal symbiosis and how corals may respond to future environmental
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{The carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius is a major natural enemy of
   pests, such as aphids and slugs in agricultural systems. Earthworms are
   a dominant non-pest component of the diet of P. melanarius which help
   sustain the beetles during periods when the pest population is low or
   absent. In this study we wanted to test whether this predator exercises
   prey choice among different earthworm species or ecological groups. High
   levels of genetic diversity within morphological species of earthworm
   necessitated the development of primers that were specific not just to
   species but lineages and sub-lineages within species as well. Gut
   samples from beetles were analysed using multiplex-PCR and
   fluorescent-labelled primers. Calibratory feeding trials were undertaken
   to calculate median detection times for prey DNA following ingestion.
   Extensive testing demonstrated that the primers were species-specific,
   that detection periods were negatively related to amplicon size and that
   meal size had a highly significant effect on detection periods. Monte
   Carlo simulations showed that, in general, worms were being predated in
   proportion to their densities in the field with little evidence of prey
   choice, other than probable avoidance of the larger, deep-living
   species. There was no evidence that epigeic species were being taken
   preferentially in comparison with endogeic species. There was also no
   evidence that defensive secretions by Allolobophora chlorotica reduced
   predation pressure on this species by P. melanarius. We concluded that
   any management system that increases earthworm densities generally,
   regardless of component species, is likely to be optimal for increasing
   numbers of this beneficial beetle predator.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas sexual reproduction may facilitate adaptation to complex
   environments with many biotic interactions, simplified environments are
   expected to favour asexual reproduction. In agreement with this, recent
   studies on invertebrates have shown a prevalence of asexual species in
   agricultural (simplified) but not in natural (complex) environments. We
   investigated whether the same correlation between reproductive mode and
   habitat can be found in different populations within one species. The
   parasitoid wasp Tetrastichus coeruleus forms an ideal model to test this
   question, since it occurs both in natural and agricultural environments.
   Further, we investigated whether Wolbachia infection caused
   parthenogenesis in female-biased populations. In contrast to the general
   pattern, in Dutch and French natural areas, we found Wolbachia-infected,
   highly female-biased populations that reproduce parthenogenetically. In
   contrast, populations on Dutch agricultural fields were not infected
   with Wolbachia, showed higher frequencies of males and reproduced
   sexually. However, we also found a female-only, Wolbachia-infected
   population on agricultural fields in north-eastern United States. All
   Wolbachia-infected populations were infected with the same Wolbachia
   strain. At this moment, we do not have a convincing explanation for this
   deviation from the general pattern of ecology and reproductive mode. It
   may be that asparagus agricultural fields differ from other crop fields
   in ways that favour sexual reproduction. Alternatively, Wolbachia may
   manipulate life history traits in its host, resulting in different
   fitness pay-offs in different habitats. The fixation of Wolbachia in the
   United States populations (where the species was introduced) may be due
   to founder effect and lack of uninfected, sexual source populations.}},

Abstract = {{As the dominant seed dispersal agents in many ecosystems, frugivorous
   animals profoundly impact gene movement and fine-scale genetic structure
   of plants. Most frugivores engage in some form of destination-based
   dispersal, in that they move seeds towards specific destinations,
   resulting in clumped distributions of seeds away from the source tree.
   Molecular analyses of dispersed seeds and seedlings suggest that
   destination-based dispersal may often yield clusters of maternal
   genotypes and lead to pronounced local genetic structure. The
   long-wattled umbrellabird Cephalopterus penduliger is a frugivorous bird
   whose lek mating system creates a species-specific pattern of seed
   dispersal that can potentially be distinguished from background
   dispersal processes. We used this system to test how destination-based
   dispersal by umbrellabirds into the lek affects gene movement and
   genetic structure of one of their preferred food sources Oenocarpus
   bataua, a canopy palm tree. Relative to background dispersal processes,
   umbrellabird mating behaviour yielded more diverse seed pools in leks
   that included on average five times more seed sources and a higher
   incidence of long-distance dispersal events. This resulted in markedly
   lower fine-scale spatial genetic structure among established seedlings
   in leks than background areas. These species-specific impacts of
   destination-based dispersal illustrate how detailed knowledge of
   disperser behaviour can elucidate the mechanistic link driving observed
   patterns of seed movement and genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Population connectivity, the extent to which geographically separated
   subpopulations exchange individuals and are demographically linked, is
   important to the scientific management of marine living resources. In
   theory, the design of a marine protected area, for example, depends on
   an explicit understanding of how dispersal of planktonic larvae affects
   metapopulation structure and dynamics (Botsford et al. 2001). In
   practice, for most marine metazoans with planktonic larvae, the mean and
   variance of the distances that larvae disperse are unobservable
   quantities, owing to the small sizes of larvae and the very large
   volumes through which they are distributed. Simulation of dispersal
   kernels with models that incorporate oceanography and limited aspects of
   larval biology and behaviour, coupled with field studies of larval
   distribution, abundance, and settlement, have provided the best
   available approaches to date for understanding connectivity of marine
   populations (Cowen et al. 2006). On the other hand, marine population
   connectivity has often been judged by spatial variation in the
   frequencies of alleles and genotypes, although the inherent limitations
   of this indirect approach to measuring larval dispersal have often been
   overlooked (Hedgecock et al. 2007). More recently, researchers have
   turned to genetic methods and highly polymorphic markers that can
   provide direct evidence of population connectivity in the form of
   parentage or relatedness of recruits (e.g. Jones et al. 2005). In this
   issue, Christie et al. (2010) provide a particularly elegant example, in
   which both indirect and novel direct genetic methods are used to
   determine the major ecological processes shaping dispersal patterns of
   larval bicolour damselfish Stegastes partitus, a common and widespread
   reef fish species in the Caribbean Basin (Fig. 1).}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, are comprised of
   at least two reproductively isolated, sympatric populations. In this
   issue, White et al. (2010) use extensive sampling, high-density tiling
   microarrays, and an updated reference genome to clarify and expand our
   knowledge of genomic differentiation between these populations. It is
   now clear that DNA near the centromeres of all three chromosomes are in
   near-perfect disequilibrium with each other. This is in stark contrast
   to the remaining 97\% of the assembled genome, where fixed differences
   between populations have not been found, and many polymorphisms are
   shared. This pattern, coupled with direct evidence of hybridization in
   nature, supports models of ``mosaic{''} speciation, where ongoing
   hybridization homogenizes variation in most of the genome while loci
   under strong selection remain in disequilibrium with each other.
   However, unambiguously demonstrating that selection maintains the
   association of these pericentric ``speciation islands{''} in the face of
   gene flow is difficult. Low recombination at all three loci complicates
   the issue, and increases the probability that selection unrelated to the
   speciation process alters patterns of variation in these loci. Here, we
   discuss these different scenarios in light of this new data.}},

Abstract = {{Asexuality is an important mode of reproduction in eukaryotic taxa and
   has a theoretical advantage over sexual reproduction because of the
   increased ability to propagate genes. Despite this advantage, hidden
   signs of cryptic sex have been discovered in the genomes of asexual
   organisms. This has provided an interesting way to address the
   evolutionary impact of sex in plant and animal populations. However, the
   identification of rare sexual reproduction events in mainly asexual
   species has remained a challenging task. We examined the reproductive
   history in populations of the plant parasitic nematode Xiphinema index
   by genotyping individuals collected from six grapevine fields using
   seven microsatellite markers. A high level of linkage disequilibrium and
   heterozygous excess suggested a clonality rate of 95-100\%. However, we
   also detected rare sexual reproduction events within these highly clonal
   populations. By combining highly polymorphic markers with an appropriate
   hierarchical sampling, and using both Bayesian and multivariate analysis
   with phylogenetic reconstructions, we were able to identify a small
   number of sexually produced individuals at the overlapping zones between
   different genetic clusters. This suggested that sexual reproduction was
   favoured when and where two nematode patches came into contact. Among
   fields, a high degree of genetic differentiation indicated a low level
   of gene flow between populations. Rare genotypes that were shared by
   several populations suggested passive dispersal by human activities,
   possibly through the introduction of infected plants from nurseries. We
   conclude that our method can be used to detect and locate sexual events
   in various predominantly asexual species.}},

Abstract = {{The dramatic increase in marine bio-invasions, particularly of
   non-indigenous ascidians, has highlighted the vulnerability of marine
   ecosystems and the productive sectors that rely on them. A critical
   issue in managing invasive species is determining the relative roles of
   ongoing introductions, versus the local movement of propagules from
   established source populations. Styela clava (Herdman, 1882), the Asian
   clubbed tunicate, once restricted to the Pacific shores of Asia and
   Russia, is now abundant throughout the northern and southern hemispheres
   and has had significant economic impact in at least one site of
   incursion. In 2005 S. clava was identified in New Zealand. The recent
   introduction of this species, coupled with its restricted distribution,
   provided an ideal model to compare and contrast the introduction and
   expansion process. In this study, the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome
   oxidase subunit I gene (COI) gene and 11 microsatellite markers were
   used to test the regional genetic structure and diversity of 318 S.
   clava individuals from 10 populations within New Zealand. Both markers
   showed significant differentiation between the northern and southern
   populations, indicative of minimal pre- or post-border connectivity.
   Additional statistics further support pre- and post-border
   differentiation among Port and Harbour populations (i.e. marinas and
   aquaculture farms). We conclude that New Zealand receives multiple
   introductions, and that the primary vector for pre-border incursions and
   post-border spread is most likely the extensive influx of recreational
   vessels that enter northern marinas independent of the Port. This is a
   timely reminder of the potential for hull-fouling organisms to expand
   their range as climates change and open new pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Many alpine species are under threat from global climate change, as
   their geographic ranges become increasingly fragmented and unsuitable.
   Understanding rates and determinants of gene flow among such fragmented
   populations, over historical as well as recent timescales, can help to
   identify populations under threat. It is also important to clarify the
   degree to which loss of local populations reduces overall genetic
   diversity within the taxon. The endangered Blue Mountains Water Skink
   (Eulamprus leuraensis) is restricted to < 40 small swamps in montane
   south-eastern Australia. Our analyses of seven microsatellite loci of
   241 animals from 13 populations show strong geographic structure, with
   major genetic divergence even between populations separated by < 0.5 km.
   Dispersal between populations is scarce, and appears to involve mostly
   males. Our analyses suggest potential recent bottleneck events in all
   the identified populations, and lower genetic diversity and population
   size parameter at lower-elevation sites than at higher-elevation sites.
   Management of this endangered taxon thus needs to treat most populations
   separately, because of their genetic distinctiveness and low rates of
   genetic exchange.}},

Abstract = {{The network architecture of streams and rivers constrains evolutionary,
   demographic and ecological processes of freshwater organisms. This
   consistent architecture also makes stream networks useful for testing
   general models of population genetic structure and the scaling of gene
   flow. We examined genetic structure and gene flow in the facultatively
   paedomorphic Idaho giant salamander, Dicamptodon aterrimus, in stream
   networks of Idaho and Montana, USA. We used microsatellite data to test
   population structure models by (i) examining hierarchical partitioning
   of genetic variation in stream networks; and (ii) testing for genetic
   isolation by distance along stream corridors vs. overland pathways.
   Replicated sampling of streams within catchments within three river
   basins revealed that hierarchical scale had strong effects on genetic
   structure and gene flow. amova identified significant structure at all
   hierarchical scales (among streams, among catchments, among basins), but
   divergence among catchments had the greatest structural influence.
   Isolation by distance was detected within catchments, and in-stream
   distance was a strong predictor of genetic divergence. Patterns of
   genetic divergence suggest that differentiation among streams within
   catchments was driven by limited migration, consistent with a stream
   hierarchy model of population structure. However, there was no evidence
   of migration among catchments within basins, or among basins, indicating
   that gene flow only counters the effects of genetic drift at smaller
   scales (within rather than among catchments). These results show the
   strong influence of stream networks on population structure and genetic
   divergence of a salamander, with contrasting effects at different
   hierarchical scales.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated temporal changes in hybridization and introgression
   between native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and invasive Japanese sika
   (Cervus nippon) on the Kintyre Peninsula, Scotland, over 15 years,
   through analysis of 1513 samples of deer at 20 microsatellite loci and a
   mtDNA marker. We found no evidence that either the proportion of recent
   hybrids, or the levels of introgression had changed over the study
   period. Nevertheless, in one population where the two species have been
   in contact since similar to 1970, 44\% of individuals sampled during the
   study were hybrids. This suggests that hybridization between these
   species can proceed fairly rapidly. By analysing the number of alleles
   that have introgressed from polymorphic red deer into the genetically
   homogenous sika population, we reconstructed the haplotypes of red deer
   alleles introduced by backcrossing. Five separate hybridization events
   could account for all the recently hybridized sika-like individuals
   found across a large section of the Peninsula. Although we demonstrate
   that low rates of F1 hybridization can lead to substantial
   introgression, the progress of hybridization and introgression appears
   to be unpredictable over the short timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Previous efforts to uncover the genetic underpinnings of ongoing
   ecological speciation of the M and S forms of the African malaria vector
   Anopheles gambiae revealed two centromere-proximal islands of genetic
   divergence on X and chromosome 2. Under the assumption of considerable
   ongoing gene flow between M and S, these persistently divergent genomic
   islands were widely considered to be `speciation islands'. In the course
   of microarray-based divergence mapping, we discovered a third
   centromere-associated island of divergence on chromosome 3, which was
   validated by targeted re-sequencing. To test for genetic association
   between the divergence islands on all three chromosomes, SNP-based
   assays were applied in four natural populations of M and S spanning
   West, Central and East Africa. Genotyping of 517 female M and S
   mosquitoes revealed nearly complete linkage disequilibrium between the
   centromeres of the three independently assorting chromosomes. These
   results suggest that despite the potential for inter-form gene flow
   through hybridization, actual (realized) gene flow between M and S may
   be substantially less than commonly assumed and may not explain most
   shared variation. Moreover, the possibility of very low gene flow calls
   into question whether diverged pericentromeric regions-characterized by
   reduced levels of variation and recombination-are in fact instrumental
   rather than merely incidental to the speciation process.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypically diverse Lake Malawi cichlids exhibit similar genomes. The
   extensive sharing of genetic polymorphism among forms has both intrigued
   and frustrated biologists trying to understand the nature of diversity
   in this and other rapidly evolving systems. Shared polymorphism might
   result from hybridization and/or the retention of ancestrally
   polymorphic alleles. To examine these alternatives, we used new genomic
   tools to characterize genetic differentiation in widespread,
   geographically structured populations of Labeotropheus fuelleborni and
   Metriaclima zebra. These phenotypically distinct species share
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes and show greater mtDNA
   differentiation among localities than between species. However, Bayesian
   analysis of nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data revealed
   two distinct genetic clusters corresponding perfectly to morphologically
   diagnosed L. fuelleborni and M. zebra. This result is a function of the
   resolving power of the multi-locus dataset, not a conflict between
   nuclear and mitochondrial partitions. Locus-by-locus analysis showed
   that mtDNA differentiation between species (F(CT)) was nearly identical
   to the median single-locus SNP F(CT). Finally, we asked whether there is
   evidence for gene flow at sites of co-occurrence. We used simulations to
   generate a null distribution for the level of differentiation between
   co-occurring populations of L. fuelleborni and M. zebra expected if
   there was no hybridization. The null hypothesis was rejected for the SNP
   data; populations that co-occur at rock reef sites were slightly more
   similar than expected by chance, suggesting recent gene flow. The
   coupling of numerous independent markers with extensive geographic
   sampling and simulations utilized here provides a framework for
   assessing the prevalence of gene flow in recently diverged species.}},

Abstract = {{Species discovery through large-scale sampling of mitochondrial
   diversity, as advocated under DNA barcoding, has been widely criticized.
   Two of the primary weaknesses of this approach, the use of a single gene
   marker for species delineation and the possible co-amplification of
   nuclear pseudogenes, can be circumvented through incorporation of
   multiple data sources. Here I show that for taxonomic groups with poorly
   characterized systematics, large-scale genetic screening using a
   mitochondrial DNA marker can be a very effective approach to species
   discovery. Global sampling (120 locations) of 1295 individuals of 22
   described species of eucalanid copepods identified 15 novel
   evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) within this marine
   holoplanktonic family. Species limits were tested under reciprocal
   monophyly at the mitochondrial (mt) gene 16S rRNA, and 13 of 15 lineages
   were reciprocally monophyletic under three phylogenetic inference
   methods. Five of these mitochondrial ESUs also received moderate support
   for reciprocal monophyly at the independently-inherited nuclear gene,
   internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Additional support for the utility
   of mt DNA as a proxy for species boundaries in this taxon is discussed,
   including results from related morphological and biogeographic studies.
   Minimal overlap of intra-ESU and inter-ESU 16S rRNA genetic distances
   was observed, suggesting that this mt marker performs well for species
   discovery via molecular screening. Sampling coverage required for the
   discovery of new ESUs was found to be in the range of > 50
   individuals/species, well above the sampling intensity of most current
   DNA Barcoding studies. Large-scale genetic screening can provide
   critical first data on the presence of cryptic species, and should be
   used as an approach to generate systematic hypotheses in groups with
   incomplete taxonomies.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to contrasting upland and
   lowland habitats has been extensively studied with respect to behaviour,
   morphology and life history traits. Yet population history has not been
   studied at the whole-genome level. Although single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of variation in many
   genomes and consequently very informative for a genome-wide picture of
   standing natural variation in populations, genome-wide SNP data are
   rarely available for wild vertebrates. Here we use genetically mapped
   SNP markers to comprehensively survey genetic variation within and among
   naturally occurring guppy populations from a wide geographic range in
   Trinidad and Venezuela. Results from three different clustering methods,
   Neighbor-net, principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian analysis
   show that the population substructure agrees with geographic separation
   and largely with previously hypothesized patterns of historical
   colonization. Within major drainages (Caroni, Oropouche and Northern),
   populations are genetically similar, but those in different geographic
   regions are highly divergent from one another, with some indications of
   ancient shared polymorphisms. Clear genomic signatures of a previous
   introduction experiment were seen, and we detected additional potential
   admixture events. Headwater populations were significantly less
   heterozygous than downstream populations. Pairwise F(ST) values revealed
   marked differences in allele frequencies among populations from
   different regions, and also among populations within the same region.
   F(ST) outlier methods indicated some regions of the genome as being
   under directional selection. Overall, this study demonstrates the power
   of a genome-wide SNP data set to inform for studies on natural
   variation, adaptation and evolution of wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about past vegetation dynamics in Eastern Tropical South
   America (ETSA). Here we describe patterns of chloroplast (cp) DNA
   variation in Plathymenia reticulata, a widespread tree in the ETSA
   Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes, but not found in the xeromorphic
   Caatinga. Forty one populations, comprising 220 individuals, were
   analysed by sequencing the trnS-trnG and trnL-trnL-trnF cpDNA regions.
   Combined, they resulted in 18 geographically structured haplotypes. The
   central region of the sampling area, comprising Minas Gerais and Goias
   Brazilian states, is a centre of genetic diversity and probably the most
   longstanding area of the distribution range of the species. In contrast,
   populations from northeastern Brazil and the southern Cerrados showed
   very low diversity levels, almost exclusively with common haplotypes
   which are also found in the central region. Coupled with a long-branched
   star-like network, these patterns suggest a recent range expansion of P.
   reticulata to those regions from central region sources. The recent
   origin of the species (in the early Pleistocene) or the extinction of
   some populations due to drier and cooler climate during the last glacial
   maximum could have been responsible for that phylogeographic pattern.
   The populations from northeastern Brazil originated from two
   colonization routes, one eastern (Atlantic) and one western (inland).
   Due to its high diversity and complex landscape, the central region,
   especially central-north Minas Gerais (between 15 degrees-18 degrees S
   and 42 degrees-46 degrees W), should be given the highest priority for
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Aegilops tauschii Coss. is the D-genome progenitor of hexaploid wheat.
   Aegilops tauschii, a wild diploid species, has a wide natural species
   range in central Eurasia, spreading from Turkey to western China.
   Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis using a total of
   122 accessions of Ae. tauschii was conducted to clarify the population
   structure of this widespread wild wheat species. Phylogenetic and
   principal component analyses revealed two major lineages in Ae.
   tauschii. Bayesian population structure analyses based on the AFLP data
   showed that lineages one (L1) and two (L2) were respectively
   significantly divided into six and three sublineages. Only four out of
   the six L1 sublineages were diverged from those of western habitats in
   the Transcaucasia and northern Iran region to eastern habitats such as
   Pakistan and Afghanistan. Other sublineages including L2 were
   distributed to a limited extent in the western region. Subspecies
   strangulata seemed to be differentiated in one sublineage of L2. Among
   three major haplogroups (HG7, HG9 and HG16) previously identified in the
   Ae. tauschii population based on chloroplast variation, HG7 accessions
   were widely distributed to both L1 and L2, HG9 accessions were
   restricted to L2, and HG16 accessions belonged to L1, suggesting that
   HG9 and HG16 were formed from HG7 after divergence of the first two
   lineages of the nuclear genome. These results on the population
   structure of Ae. tauschii and the genealogical relationship among Ae.
   tauschii accessions should provide important agricultural and
   evolutionary knowledge on genetic resources and conservation of natural
   genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Casiquiare River is a unique biogeographic corridor between the
   Orinoco and Amazonas basins. We investigated the importance of this
   connection for Neotropical fishes using peacock cichlids (Cichla spp.)
   as a model system. We tested whether the Casiquiare provides a conduit
   for gene flow between contemporary populations, and investigated the
   origin of biogeographic distributions that span the Casiquiare. Using
   sequences from the mitochondrial control region of three focal species
   (C. temensis, C. monoculus, and C. orinocensis) whose distributions
   include the Amazonas, Orinoco, and Casiquiare, we constructed maximum
   likelihood phylograms of haplotypes and analyzed the populations under
   an isolation-with-migration coalescent model. Our analyses suggest that
   populations of all three species have experienced some degree of gene
   flow via the Casiquiare. We also generated a mitochondrial genealogy of
   all Cichla species using > 2000 bp and performed a dispersal-vicariance
   analysis (DIVA) to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus.
   This analysis, when combined with the intraspecific results, supports
   two instances of dispersal from the Amazonas to the Orinoco. Thus, our
   results support the idea that the Casiquiare connection is important
   across temporal scales, facilitating both gene flow and the dispersal
   and range expansion of species.}},

Abstract = {{The Fynbos biome in South Africa is renowned for its high plant
   diversity and the conservation of this area is particularly important
   for the region. This is especially true in the case of endangered
   vegetation types on the lowlands such as Sand Fynbos, of which only
   small fragments remain. The question is thus whether the diversity of
   the above-ground flora is mirrored in the below-ground microbial
   communities. In order to determine the relationship of the above- and
   below-ground communities, the soil community composition of both fungal
   and bacterial groups in Sand Fynbos was characterized over space and
   time. A molecular approach was used based on the isolation of total soil
   genomic DNA and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of
   bacterial and fungal communities. Soil from four different sites was
   compared to resolve the microbial diversity of eubacterial and fungal
   groups on a local (alpha diversity) scale as well as a landscape scale
   (beta diversity). The community structures from different sites were
   compared and found to exhibit strong spatial patterns which remained
   stable over time. The plant community data were compared with the fungal
   and the bacterial communities. We concluded that the microbial
   communities in the Sand Fynbos are highly diverse and closely linked to
   the above-ground floral communities.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying patterns of larval dispersal within marine metapopulations
   is vital for effective fisheries management, appropriate marine reserve
   design, and conservation efforts. We employed genetic markers
   (microsatellites) to determine dispersal patterns in bicolour damselfish
   (Pomacentridae: Stegastes partitus). Tissue samples of 751 fish were
   collected in 2004 and 2005 from 11 sites encompassing the Exuma Sound,
   Bahamas. Bayesian parentage analysis identified two parent-offspring
   pairs, which is remarkable given the large population sizes and 28 day
   pelagic larval duration of bicolour damselfish. The two parent-offspring
   pairs directly documented self-recruitment at the two northern-most
   sites, one of which is a long-established marine reserve. Principal
   coordinates analyses of pair-wise relatedness values further indicated
   that self-recruitment was common in all sampled populations.
   Nevertheless, measures of genetic differentiation (F(ST)) and results
   from assignment methods suggested high levels of gene flow among
   populations. Comparisons of heterozygosity and relatedness among samples
   of adults and recruits indicated spatially and temporally independent
   sweepstakes events, whereby only a subset of adults successfully
   contribute to subsequent generations. These results indicate that
   self-recruitment and sweepstakes reproduction are the predominant,
   ecologically-relevant processes that shape patterns of larval dispersal
   in this system.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of genetic measures for kinship reconstruction in polysomic
   species is not well evaluated. We developed a framework to test
   hypotheses about estimating breeding population size indirectly from
   collections of outmigrating green sturgeon juveniles. We evaluated a
   polysomic dataset, in allelic frequency and phenotypic formats, from
   green sturgeon to describe the relationship among known progeny from
   experimental families. The distributions of relatedness values for kin
   classes were used for reconstructing green sturgeon pedigrees from
   juveniles of unknown relationship. We compared three rarefaction
   functions that described the relationship between the number of kin
   groups and number of samples in a pedigree to estimate the annual
   abundance of spawners contributing to the threatened green sturgeon
   Southern Distinct Population Segment in the upper Sacramento River.
   Results suggested the estimated abundance of breeding green sturgeon
   remained roughly constant in the upper Sacramento River over a 5-year
   period, ranging from 10 to 28 individuals depending on the year and
   rarefaction method. These results demonstrate an empirical understanding
   for the distribution of relatedness values among individuals is a
   benefit for assessing pedigree reconstruction methods and identifying
   misclassification rates. Monitoring of rare species using these indirect
   methods is feasible and can provide insight into breeding and
   ontogenetic behaviour. While this framework was developed for specific
   application to studying fish populations in a riverscape, the framework
   could be advanced to improve genetic estimation of breeding population
   size and to identify important breeding habitats of rare species when
   combined with finer-scaled sampling of offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity assessment is the key to understanding the relationship
   between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but there is a
   well-acknowledged biodiversity identification gap related to eukaryotic
   meiofaunal organisms. Meiofaunal identification is confounded by the
   small size of taxa, morphological convergence and intraspecific
   variation. However, the most important restricting factor in meiofaunal
   ecological research is the mismatch between diversity and the number of
   taxonomists that are able to simultaneously identify and catalogue
   meiofaunal diversity. Accordingly, a molecular operational taxonomic
   unit (MOTU)-based approach has been advocated for en mass meiofaunal
   biodiversity assessment, but it has been restricted by the lack of
   throughput afforded by chain termination sequencing. Contemporary
   pyrosequencing offers a solution to this problem in the form of
   environmental metagenetic analyses, but this represents a novel field of
   biodiversity assessment. Here, we provide an overview of meiofaunal
   metagenetic analyses, ranging from sample preservation and DNA
   extraction to PCR, sequencing and the bioinformatic interrogation of
   multiple, independent samples using 454 Roche sequencing platforms. We
   report two examples of environmental metagenetic nuclear small subunit
   18S (nSSU) analyses of marine and tropical rainforest habitats and
   provide critical appraisals of the level of putative recombinant DNA
   molecules (chimeras) in metagenetic data sets. Following stringent
   quality control measures, environmental metagenetic analyses achieve
   MOTU formation across the eukaryote domain of life at a fraction of the
   time and cost of traditional approaches. The effectiveness of Roche 454
   sequencing brings substantial advantages to studies aiming to elucidate
   the molecular genetic richness of not only meiofaunal, but also all
   complex eukaryotic communities.}},

Abstract = {{Sequencing of ribosomal DNA clone libraries amplified from environmental
   DNA has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote
   diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that
   protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their
   morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is
   labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased.
   Therefore, even the most intensive rDNA library analyses have recovered
   only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global
   environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity.
   High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented
   scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here,
   we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of
   eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two SSU rDNA
   diversity markers-the variable V4 and V9 regions-from 10 L of anoxic
   Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique
   sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in
   both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and
   close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454
   sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most
   tags detected represent genotypes not currently in GenBank, although
   many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current
   understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities,
   genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by
   the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological
   significance of this high amplicon diversity.}},

   seasonal community turnover of alveolates (Ciliophora and Dinophyceae)
   in an oligotrophic freshwater lake by SSU amplicon sequencing with NGS
   as well as by classical morphological analysis. We complemented the
   morphological analysis by single-cell PCR followed by Sanger sequencing
   to provide an unambiguous link to the NGS data. We show that NGS and
   morphological analyses generally capture frequency shifts of abundant
   taxa over our seasonal samples. The observed incongruencies are probably
   largely due to rDNA copy number variation among taxa and heterogeneity
   in the efficiency of cell lysis. Overall, NGS-based amplicon sequencing
   was superior in detecting rare species. We propose that in the absence
   of other nuclear markers less susceptible to copy number variation,
   rDNA-based diversity studies need to be adjusted for confounding effects
   of copy number variation.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed two sites within and outside an urban development in a rural
   background to estimate the fungal richness, diversity and community
   composition in Quercus spp. ectomycorrhizas using massively parallel
   454-sequencing in combination with DNA-tagging. Our analyses indicated
   that shallow sequencing (similar to 150 sequences) of a large number of
   samples (192 in total) provided data that allowed identification of
   seasonal trends within the fungal communities: putative root-associated
   antagonists and saprobes that were abundant early in the growing season
   were replaced by common ectomycorrhizal fungi in the course of the
   growing season. Ordination analyses identified a number of factors that
   were correlated with the observed communities including host species as
   well as soil organic matter, nutrient and heavy metal enrichment.
   Overall, our application of the high throughput 454 sequencing provided
   ail expedient means for characterization of fungal communities.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 100 years, Arctic temperatures have increased at almost
   twice the global average rate. One consequence is the acceleration of
   glacier retreat, exposing new habitats that are colonized by
   microorganisms whose diversity and function are unknown. Here, we
   characterized bacterial diversity along two approximately parallel
   chronosequences in an Arctic glacier forefield that span six time points
   following glacier retreat. We assessed changes in phylotype richness,
   evenness and turnover rate through the analysis of 16S rRNA gene
   sequences recovered from 52 samples taken from surface layers along the
   chronosequences. An average of 4500 sequences was obtained from each
   sample by 454 pyrosequencing. Using parametric methods, it was estimated
   that bacterial phylotype richness was high, and that it increased
   significantly from an average of 4000 (at a threshold of 97\% sequence
   similarity) at locations exposed for 5 years to an average of 7050
   phylotypes per 0.5 g of soil at sites that had been exposed for 150
   years. Phylotype evenness also increased over time, with an evenness of
   0.74 for 150 years since glacier retreat reflecting large proportions of
   rare phylotypes. The bacterial species turnover rate was especially high
   between sites exposed for 5 and 19 years. The level of bacterial
   diversity present in this High Arctic glacier foreland was comparable
   with that found in temperate and tropical soils, raising the question
   whether global patterns of bacterial species diversity parallel that of
   plants and animals, which have been found to form a latitudinal gradient
   and be lower in polar regions compared with the tropics.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Heavy metal contamination negatively affects natural systems including
   plants, birds, fish and bacteria by reducing biodiversity at
   contaminated sites. At the Tri-State Milling District, efforts have been
   made to remediate sites to mitigate the detrimental effects that
   contamination has caused on human health. While the remediation effort
   has returned the site to within federal safety standards, it is unclear
   if this effort is sufficient to restore floral and faunal communities.
   Intrinsic to ecosystem and organism health is the biodiversity and
   composition of microbial communities. We have taken advantage of recent
   advances in sequencing technology and surveyed the bacterial community
   of remediated and reference soils as well as the intestinal microbial
   community of two ubiquitous rodent species to provide insight on the
   impacts of residual heavy metal contamination on the ecosystem. Rodents
   found on the remediated site had reduced body mass, smaller body size
   and lower body fat than animals on reference sites. Using barcoded,
   massively parallel sequencing, we found that bacterial communities in
   both the soil and Peromyscus spp. gastrointestinal tracts had no
   difference in diversity between reference and remediated sites but
   assemblages differed in response to contamination. These results suggest
   that niche voids left by microbial taxa that were unable to deal with
   the remnant levels of heavy metals on remediated sites were replaced by
   taxa that could persist in this environment. Whether this replacement
   provided similar ecosystem services as ancestral bacterial communities
   is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental samples have been analysed for viruses in metagenomic
   studies, but these studies have not linked individual viruses to their

   of RNA virus infection, from individual plants and convert this to cDNA
   with a unique four nucleotide Tag at each end. Using 96 different Tags
   allowed us to pool samples and still retain the link to the original
   sample. We then analysed the sequence of pooled samples using massively
   parallel sequencing with Roche 454 pyrosequencing such that 384 samples
   could be assessed per picotiter plate. Using this method we have been
   able to analyse thousands of plants, and we have discovered several
   thousand new plant viruses, all linked to their specific plant hosts.
   Here we describe the method in detail, including the results and
   analysis for eight pools of samples. This technology will be extremely
   useful in understanding the full scope of plant virus biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying genes that underlie ecological traits will open exiting
   possibilities to study gene-environment interactions in shaping
   phenotypes and in measuring natural selection on genes. Evolutionary
   ecology has been pursuing these objectives for decades, but they come
   into reach now that next generation sequencing technologies have
   dramatically lowered the costs to obtain the genomic sequence
   information that is currently lacking for most ecologically important
   species. Here we describe how we generated over 2 billion basepairs of
   novel sequence information for an ecological model species, the great
   tit Parus major. We used over 16 million short sequence reads for the de
   novo assembly of a reference sequence consisting of 550 000 contigs,
   covering 2.5\% of the genome of the great tit. This reference sequence
   was used as the scaffold for mapping of the sequence reads, which
   allowed for the detection of over 20 000 novel single nucleotide
   polymorphisms. Contigs harbouring 4272 of the single nucleotide
   polymorphisms could be mapped to a unique location on the recently
   sequenced zebra finch genome. Of all the great tit contigs,
   significantly more were mapped to the microchromosomes than to the
   intermediate and the macrochromosomes of the zebra finch, indicating a
   higher overall level of sequence conservation on the microchromosomes
   than on the other types of chromosomes. The large number of great tit
   contigs that can be aligned to the zebra finch genome shows that this
   genome provides a valuable framework for large scale genetics, e.g. QTL
   mapping or whole genome association studies, in passerines.}},

Abstract = {{Critical to conservation efforts and other investigations at low
   taxonomic levels, DNA sequence data offer important insights into the
   distinctiveness, biogeographic partitioning and evolutionary histories
   of species. The resolving power of DNA sequences is often limited by
   insufficient variability at the intraspecific level. This is
   particularly true of studies involving plant organelles, as the
   conservative mutation rate of chloroplasts and mitochondria makes it
   difficult to detect polymorphisms necessary to track genealogical
   relationships among individuals, populations and closely related taxa,
   through space and time. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) makes it
   possible to acquire entire organelle genome sequences to identify
   cryptic variation that would be difficult to detect otherwise. We are
   using NIPS to evaluate intraspecific chloroplast-level divergence across
   biogeographic boundaries in narrowly endemic and widespread species of
   Pinus. We focus on one of the world's rarest pines - Torrey pine (Pinus
   torreyana) - due to its conservation interest and because it provides a
   marked contrast to more widespread pine species. Detailed analysis of
   nearly 90\% (similar to 105 000 bp each) of these chloroplast genomes
   shows that mainland and island populations of Torrey pine differ at five
   sites in their plastome, with the differences fixed between populations.
   This is an exceptionally low level of divergence (1 polymorphism/similar
   to 21 kb), yet it is comparable to intraspecific divergence present in
   widespread pine species and species complexes. Population-level
   organelle genome sequencing offers new vistas into the timing and
   magnitude of divergence within species, and is certain to provide
   greater insight into pollen dispersal, migration patterns and
   evolutionary dynamics in plants.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing allows the discovery of large numbers of
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in species where little genomic
   information was previously available. Here, we assembled, de novo, over
   130 mb of non-normalized cDNA using 454 pyrosequencing data from dwarf
   and normal lake whitefish and backcross hybrids. Our main goals were to
   gather a large data set of SNP markers, document their distribution
   within coding regions, evaluate the effect of species divergence oil
   allele frequencies and combine results with previous genomic studies to
   identify candidate genes underlying the adaptive divergence of take
   whitefish. We identified 6094 putative SNPs in 2674 contigs (mean size:
   576 bp, range: 101-6116) and 1540 synonymous and 1734 non-synonymous
   mutations for a genome-wide non-synonymous to synonymous substitution
   rate ratio (p(N)/p(S)) of 0.37. As expected based on the young age (<1.5
   000 years) of whitefish species pair, the overall level of divergence
   between them was relatively weak. Yet, 89 SNPs showed pronounced allele
   frequency differences between sympatric normal and dwarf whitefish.
   Among these, SNPs in genes annotated to energy metabolic functions were
   the most abundant and this, in addition to previous experimental data at
   the gene expression and phenotypic level, brings compelling evidence
   that genes involved in energy metabolism are prime candidates explaining
   the adaptive divergence of lake whitefish species pairs. Finally, we
   unexpectedly identified 44 contigs annotated to transposable elements
   and these were predominantly composed of backcross hybrids sequences.
   This indicates an elevated activity of transposable elements, which
   could potentially contribute to the reduced fitness of hybrids
   previously documented.}},

Abstract = {{Tragopogon miscellus (Asteraceae) is an evolutionary model for the study
   of natural allopolyploidy, but until now has been under-resourced as a
   genetic model. Using 454 and Illumina expressed sequence tag sequencing
   of the parental diploid species of T. miscellus, we identified 7782
   single nucleotide polymorphisms that differ between the two progenitor
   genomes present in this allotetraploid. Validation of a sample of 98 of
   these SNPs in genomic DNA using Sequenom MassARRAY iPlex genotyping
   confirmed 92 SNP markers at the genomic level that were diagnostic for
   the two parental genomes. In a transcriptome profile of 2989 SNPs in a
   single T. miscellus leaf, using Illumina sequencing, 69\% of SNPs showed
   approximately equal expression of both homeologs (duplicate homologous
   genes derived from different parents), 22\% showed apparent differential
   expression and 8.5\% showed apparent silencing of one homeolog in T.
   miscellus. The majority of cases of homeolog silencing involved the T.
   dubius SNP homeolog (1.64/254; 65\%) rather than the T. pratensis
   homeolog (90/254). Sequenom analysis of genomic DNA showed that in a
   sample of 27 of the homeologs showing apparent silencing, 23 (85(V(,)
   were because of genomic homeolog loss. These methods could be applied to
   any organism, allowing efficient and cost-effective generation of

Abstract = {{Most comparative genomic analyses of short-read sequence (SRS) data rely
   upon the prior assembly of a reference sequence. Here, we present an
   assembly free analysis of SRS data that discovers sequence variants
   among focal genomes by tabulating the presence and frequency of
   `complex' fragments in the data. Using data from nine tree species, we
   compare genomic diversity from populations to families. As a control, we
   simulated SRS data for three known plant genomes. The results provide
   insight into the quality and distributional bias of the sequencing
   reaction. Three main types of informative complexmers were identified,
   each possessing unique statistical properties. Type I complexmers are
   unique to a genome but suffer from a high false positive rate, being
   highly dependent on read coverage and distribution. Type II complexmers
   are shared between two genomes and can highlight potential copy-number
   differences. Type III complexmers are exclusive to a subset of genomes
   and can be useful for associating genetic differences with phenotypic or
   geographic variation. At the population level in an endangered timber
   species, numerous markers were identified that could potentially
   determine geographic origin of individuals and regulate international
   trade. We observed that the genomic data for the four fig species were
   more divergent than for stone oak species, possibly due to their complex
   pollination syndrome and high rates of gene flow. Our approach greatly
   enhances the application of SRS technology to the study of non-model
   organisms and directly identifies the most informative genetic elements
   for more detailed study and assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in sequencing technology promise to provide new
   strategies for studying population differentiation and speciation
   phenomena in their earliest phases. We focus here on the black carrion
   crow (Corvits {[}corone] corone), which forms a zone of hybridization
   and overlap with the grey coated hooded crow (Corvus {[}corone] cornix).
   However, although these semispecies are taxonomically distinct, previous
   analyses based on several types of genetic markers did not reveal
   significant molecular differentiation between them. We here corroborate
   this result with sequence data obtained from a set of 25 nuclear
   intronic loci. Thus, the system represents a case of a very early phase
   of species divergence that requires new molecular approaches for its
   description. We have therefore generated RNAseq expression profiles
   using barcoded massively parallel pyrosequencing of brain mRNA from six
   individuals of the carrion crow and five individuals from a hybrid zone
   with the hooded crow. We obtained 856 675 reads from two runs, with
   average read length of 270 nt and coverage of 8.44. Reads were assembled
   de novo into 19 552 contigs, 70\% of which could be assigned to
   annotated genes in chicken and zebra finch. This resulted in a total of
   7637 orthologous genes and a core set of 1301 genes that could be
   compared across all individuals. We find a clear clustering of
   expression profiles for the pure carrion crow animals and disperse
   profiles for the animals from the hybrid zone. These results suggest
   that gene expression differences may indeed be a sensitive indicator of
   initial species divergence.}},

Abstract = {{In Lake Superior there are three principal forms of lake trout
   (Salvelinus namaycush): lean, siscowet and humper. Wild lean and
   siscowet differ in the shape and relative size of the head, size of the
   fins, location and size of the eyes, caudal peduncle shape and lipid
   content of the musculature. To investigate the basis for these
   phenotypic differences, lean and siscowet lake trout, derived from
   gametes of wild populations in Lake Superior, were reared communally
   under identical environmental conditions for 2.5 years. Fish were
   analysed for growth, morphometry and lipid content, and differences in
   liver transcriptomics were investigated using Roche 454 GS-FLX
   pyrosequencing. The results demonstrate that key phenotypic differences
   between wild lean and siscowet lake trout such as condition factor,
   morphometry and lipid levels, persist in these two forms when reared in
   the laboratory under identical environmental conditions. This strongly
   suggests that these differences are genetic and not a result of
   environmental plasticity. Transcriptomic analysis involving the
   comparison of hepatic gene frequencies (RNA-seq) and expression
   (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR))
   between the two lake trout forms, indicated two primary gene groups that
   were differentially expressed; those involving lipid synthesis,
   metabolism and transport (acyl-CoA desaturase, acyl-CoA binding protein,
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and apolipoproteins),
   and those involved with immunity (complement component C3, proteasome,
   FK506 binding protein 5 and C1q proteins). The results demonstrate that
   RNA-seq can be used to identify differentially expressed genes; however,
   some discrepancies between RNA-seq analysis and qPCR indicate that
   methods for deep sequencing may need to be refined and/or different
   RNA-seq platforms utilized.}},

Abstract = {{Crater lakes provide a natural laboratory to study speciation of cichlid
   fishes by ecological divergence. Up to now, there has been a dearth of
   transcriptomic and genomic information that would aid in understanding
   the molecular basis of the phenotypic differentiation between young
   species. We used next-generation sequencing (Roche 454 massively
   parallel pyrosequencing) to characterize the diversity of expressed
   sequence tags between ecologically divergent, endemic and sympatric
   species of cichlid fishes from crater lake Apoyo, Nicaragua: benthic
   Amphilophus astorquii and limnetic Amphilophus zaliosus. We obtained 24
   1.74 A. astorquii and 21 382 A. zaliosus high-quality expressed sequence
   tag contigs, of which 13 106 pairs are orthologous between species.
   Based on the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, we
   identified six sequences exhibiting signals of strong diversifying
   selection (K(a)/K(s) > 1). These included genes involved in
   biosynthesis, metabolic processes and development. This transcriptome
   sequence variation may be reflective of natural selection acting on the
   genomes of these young, sympatric sister species. Based on Ks ratios and
   p-distances between 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) calibrated to
   previously published species divergence times, we estimated a neutral
   transcriptome-wide substitutional mutation rate of similar to 1.25 x
   10(-6) per site per year. We conclude that next-generation sequencing
   technologies allow us to infer natural selection acting to diversify the
   genomes of young species, such as crater lake cichlids, with much
   greater scope than previously possible.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in gene expression are thought to be an important source of
   phenotypic diversity, so dissecting the genetic components of natural
   variation in gene expression is important for understanding the
   evolutionary mechanisms that lead to adaptation. Gene expression is a
   complex trait that, in diploid organisms, results from transcription of
   both maternal and paternal alleles. Directly measuring allelic
   expression rather than total gene expression offers greater insight into
   regulatory variation. The recent emergence of high-throughput sequencing
   offers an unprecedented opportunity to study allelic transcription at a
   genomic scale for virtually any species. By sequencing transcript pools
   derived from heterozygous individuals, estimates of allelic expression
   can be directly obtained. The statistical power of this approach is
   influenced by the number of transcripts sequenced and the ability to
   unambiguously assign individual sequence fragments to specific alleles
   on the basis of transcribed nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, using
   mathematical modelling and computer simulations, we determine the
   minimum sequencing depth required to accurately measure relative allelic
   expression and detect allelic imbalance via high-throughput sequencing
   under a variety of conditions. We conclude that, within a species, a
   minimum of 500-1000 sequencing reads per gene are needed to test for
   allelic imbalance, and consequently, at least five to 10 millions reads
   are required for studying a genome expressing 10 000 genes. Finally,
   using 454 sequencing, we illustrate an application of allelic expression
   by testing for cis-regulatory divergence between closely related
   Drosophila species.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing, the combination of different exons to produce a
   variety of transcripts from a single gene, contributes enormously to
   transcriptome diversity in mammals, and the majority of genes encode
   alternatively spliced products. Previous research comparing mouse, rat
   and human has shown that a significant proportion of splice forms are
   not conserved across species, suggesting that alternative transcripts
   are an important source of evolutionary novelty. Here, we studied the
   evolution of alternative splicing in the early stages of species
   divergence in the house mouse. We sequenced the testis transcriptomes of
   three Mus musculus subspecies and Mus spretus using Illumina technology.
   On the basis of a genome-wide analysis of read coverage differences
   among subspecies, we identified several hundred candidate alternatively
   spliced regions. We conservatively estimate that 6.5\% of
   testis-expressed genes show alternative splice differences between at
   least one pair of M. musculus subspecies, a proportion slightly higher
   than the proportion of genes differentially expressed among subspecies.
   These results suggest that differences in both the structure and
   abundance of transcripts contribute to early transcriptome divergence.}},

Abstract = {{The mimetic wing patterns of Heliconius butterflies are an excellent
   example of both adaptive radiation and convergent evolution. Alleles at
   the HmYb and HmSb loci control the presence/absence of hindwing bar and
   hindwing margin phenotypes respectively between divergent races of
   Heliconius melpomene, and also between sister species. Here, we used
   fine-scale linkage mapping to identify and sequence a BAC tilepath
   across the HmYb/Sb loci. We also generated transcriptome sequence data
   for two wing pattern forms of H. melpomene that differed in HmYb/Sb
   alleles using 454 sequencing technology. Custom scripts were used to
   process the sequence traces and generate transcriptome assemblies.
   Genomic sequence for the HmYb/Sb candidate region was annotated both
   using the MAKER pipeline and manually using transcriptome sequence
   reads. In total, 28 genes were identified in the HmYb/Sb candidate
   region, six of which have alternative splice forms. None of these are
   orthologues of genes previously identified as being expressed in
   butterfly wing pattern development, implying previously undescribed
   molecular mechanisms of pattern determination on Heliconius wings. The
   use of next-generation sequencing has therefore facilitated DNA
   annotation of a poorly characterized genome, and generated hypotheses
   regarding the identity of wing pattern at the HmYb/Sb loci.}},

Abstract = {{The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes code for the proteins
   responsible for pathogen recognition. The MHC class II DRB gene is
   multiplicated in the batik vole, Myodes glareolus, with different
   numbers of loci found in different individuals. Possessing large numbers
   of loci should increase the probability of pathogen recognition, but
   according to the optimality hypothesis, there is a cost of possessing
   too many MHC alleles. Using 454 technology, we determined the individual
   DRB allelic diversity and related it to the load of intestinal parasites
   in votes collected front three sites separated by a distance of 12 to 27
   kill. The analysis of six microsatellite loci revealed significant
   population structure (F(ST) = 0.07). The sites differed significantly in
   the prevalence and abundance of nematode species as well. We found two
   significant associations between MHC alleles and the intensity of the
   infection with the most prevalent nematode, Aspiculuris tetraptera. One
   of these associations was population-specific. This result suggests that
   the directions of selection can differ between populations connected by
   a low level of gene flow, which may contribute to the maintenance of
   high DRB allele diversity. In accordance with the optimality hypothesis,
   individuals with ail intermediate number of alleles carried the lowest
   number of nematode species and had the lowest prevalence of A.
   tetraptera. However, the intensity of infection with A. tetraptera was
   linearly and negatively associated with the number of alleles.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing technology provides an attractive means to
   obtain large-scale sequence data necessary for comparative genomic
   analysis. To analyse the patterns of mutation rate variation and
   selection intensity across the avian genome, we performed brain
   transcriptome sequencing using Roche 454 technology of 10 different
   non-model avian species. Contigs from de novo assemblies were aligned to
   the two available avian reference genomes, chicken and zebra finch. In
   total, we identified 6499 different genes across all 10 species, with
   similar to 1000 genes found in each full run per species. We found
   evidence for a higher mutation rate of the Z chromosome than of
   autosomes (male-biased mutation) and a negative correlation between the
   neutral substitution rate (d(S)) and chromosome size. Analyses of the
   mean d(N)/d(S) ratio (omega) of genes across chromosomes supported the
   Hill-Robertson effect (the effect of selection at linked loci) and point
   at stochastic problems with omega as an independent measure of
   selection. Overall, this study demonstrates the usefulness of
   next-generation sequencing for obtaining genomic resources for
   comparative genomic analysis of non-model organisms.}},

   the population recombination rate (4N(e)c). We demonstrate the accuracy
   of mlRho by applying it to simulated data sets. In addition, we analyse
   the genomes of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis and the water flea

   as to be considered invasive. Organismal features such as physiological
   tolerance, niche breadth and fecundity are critical, but by themselves
   are inaccurate predictors of the fates of introduced species (Sakai et
   al. 2001). The size, age distribution, and genetic makeup of founder
   populations are also important, but because they are usually unknown
   they are most often viewed as sources of uncertainty. For marine species
   with planktonic larvae, the challenge is even greater because the
   consequences of a planktonic phase for dispersal and population
   viability are not well understood. In this issue, Gaither et al. (2010a)
   present a remarkable account of the introduction of a reef fish for
   which the number and genetic makeup of the founders are known. Between
   1956 and 1961, the Division of Fish and Game for the Territory of Hawaii
   introduced 12 non-indigenous fish species into Hawaiian waters to
   establish commercial and sport fisheries. The introduction of Lutjanus
   kasmira, the bluestriped snapper, was the most successful (Fig. 1).
   There were two releases of fish from French Polynesia. In 1958, 2431
   fish from the Marquesas Islands were released on Oahu, followed in 1961
   with an additional 728 fish from the Society Islands. The blue striped
   snapper rapidly spread to the other Hawaiian Islands, reaching the
   northwestern end of the archipelago by 1992. The choice of the Marquesas
   as one of two sources for the introduction was fortuitous. Gaither et
   al. (2010b) found that the Marquesas population is genetically distinct
   from all other Indo-Pacific populations of L. kasmira. Mitochondrial
   cytochrome b sequences of fish from the Marquesas belong to a separate
   lineage that diverged from others in the species roughly half a Ma.
   Allele frequencies for several nuclear loci are also distinct. This
   provided Gaither et al. (2010a) with an extraordinary opportunity to
   examine what became of the mixed genetic heritage of Hawaiian blue
   striped snappers after 50 years.}},

Abstract = {{What allows some species to successfully colonize a novel environment
   while others fail? Numerous studies in invasion biology have sought to
   answer this question, but those studies have tended to focus on traits
   of species or individuals (e.g. body size, seed size, seed number), and
   these traits have largely been found to be weak predictors of invasion
   success. However, characteristics of colonizing populations (e.g.
   genetic diversity, density, age structure) might also be important for
   successful establishment, as the authors of a study published in this
   issue of Molecular Ecology show (Crawford \& Whitney 2010). By
   experimentally manipulating the density and genetic diversity of
   colonizing populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, the authors found that
   genetic diversity, but not population density, increased colonization
   success. Importantly, the effects of genetic diversity on colonization
   success were both additive and non-additive, suggesting that traits
   associated with particular genotypes and complimentarity among genotypes
   contribute to colonization success. This research highlights the
   importance of considering within-species variation and characteristics
   of entire populations in predicting colonization success.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In line with inbreeding theory, genetic diversity at a set of molecular
   markers may explain variation in fitness-associated traits in partially
   inbred populations, and such associations will appear as
   `genotype-fitness correlations'. An individual genetic diversity index
   specifically used for microsatellites is `mean d2', i.e. the mean
   squared distance between alleles. The original hypothesis for mean
   d2-fitness correlations assumes that mean d2 captures fitness effects at
   both ends of the inbreeding-outbreeding spectrum. This hypothesis
   received strong criticism from work showing that even a plain diversity
   estimate such as multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH) outperforms mean d2 as
   a predictor of the inbreeding coefficient and fitness in most realistic
   situations. Despite this critique, the mean d2-approach is still used
   frequently in ecological and evolutionary research, producing results
   suggesting that mean d2 sometimes provides a stronger prediction of
   fitness than does MLH. In light of the critique, such results are
   unexpected, but potential explanations for them may exist (at least
   hypothetically), including scenarios based on close linkage and recent
   admixture. Nevertheless, a major caveat is that it is very difficult to
   predict a priori if mean d2 will improve the genotype-fitness
   correlation, which in turn makes objective interpretations difficult.
   Mean d2-fitness associations are potentially interesting, but the fact
   that we cannot easily understand them is problematic and should be
   thoroughly addressed in each study. Therefore, instead of hastily
   reached interpretations of mean d2-fitness correlations, conclusions
   need support from complementary analyses, e.g. verifying admixture of
   genetically structured populations.}},

Abstract = {{Birds have for long been popular study objects in speciation research.
   Being easy to observe in the field, they have traditionally been
   particularly important in studies of behavioural and ecological factors
   in speciation, whereas the genetic aspects of the process have been
   studied in other organisms, such as Drosophila. More recently, however,
   a stronger genetic focus has been placed on speciation research also in
   birds. Here, we review ecological, behavioural and genetic studies on
   speciation in the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and the collared
   flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). These well-studied birds provide among
   the few proposed examples of the process of reinforcement of premating
   isolation, and the evidence for reinforcement is strong. They are
   further characterized by having strong intrinsic postzygotic barriers
   (female hybrid sterility), yet the two species appear to be very similar
   ecologically. This is in stark contrast to another well-studied bird
   complex, Darwin's finches, in which the species differ vastly in
   ecologically important traits but have no developmental problems arising
   from genetic incompatibilities, and where no evidence for reinforcement
   is found. In the flycatchers, sex chromosome linkage of genes affecting
   traits associated with both pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene
   exchange is likely to facilitate reinforcement. We discuss whether such
   sex-linkage may be common in birds. The contrast between flycatchers and
   Darwin's finches indicate that speciation in birds cannot always be
   understood mainly as a result of divergent natural selection
   ('ecological speciation'), and generalizations from one system may lead
   us astray. We discuss to what extent insight from research on the
   flycatchers may point to fruitful avenues for future research on bird
   speciation and specifically call for a more systematic effort to
   simultaneously investigate ecology, behaviour and genetics of birds
   caught in the process of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{A half century ago the State of Hawaii began a remarkable, if
   unintentional, experiment on the population genetics of introduced
   species, by releasing 2431 Bluestriped Snappers (Lutjanus kasmira) from
   the Marquesas Islands in 1958 and 728 conspecifics from the Society
   Islands in 1961. By 1992 L. kasmira had spread across the entire
   archipelago, including locations 2000 km from the release site. Genetic
   surveys of the source populations reveal diagnostic differences in the
   mtDNA control region (d = 3.8\%; phi(ST) = 0.734, P < 0.001) and
   significant allele frequency differences at nuclear DNA loci (F(ST) =
   0.49; P < 0.001). These findings, which indicate that source populations
   have been isolated for approximately half a million years, set the stage
   for a survey of the Hawaiian Archipelago (N = 385) to determine the
   success of these introductions in terms of genetic diversity and
   breeding behaviour. Both Marquesas and Society mtDNA lineages were
   detected at each survey site across the Hawaiian Archipelago, at about
   the same proportion or slightly less than the original 3.4:1
   introduction ratio. Nuclear allele frequencies and parentage tests
   demonstrate that the two source populations are freely interbreeding.
   The introduction of 2431 Marquesan founders produced only a slight
   reduction in mtDNA diversity (17\%), while the 728 Society founders
   produced a greater reduction in haplotype diversity (41\%). We find no
   evidence of genetic bottlenecks between islands of the Hawaiian
   Archipelago, as expected under a stepping-stone model of colonization,
   from the initial introduction site. This species rapidly colonized
   across 2000 km without loss of genetic diversity, illustrating the
   consequences of introducing highly dispersive marine species.}},

Abstract = {{Trichoplusia ni is a subtropical moth that migrates annually from
   southern California to southern British Columbia, Canada where it
   invades vegetable greenhouses and field crops. The heated greenhouse
   environment has altered the natural extinction-recolonization dynamics
   of T. ni populations, and allows year-round persistence in some
   locations. In addition, the extensive use of the biopesticide, Bacillus
   thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Bt) in some greenhouses has selected
   for resistance. Here we investigated the genetic structure of T. ni
   populations in British Columbia greenhouses and in field populations in
   California and British Columbia using amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms (AFLP) as related to patterns of Bt resistance. The
   majority of British Columbia field populations were similar to the
   California field populations, the potential source of migrants. However
   populations in two geographic areas with high concentrations of
   greenhouses showed local genetic differentiation. Some of these
   populations experienced severe bottlenecks over-winter and following Bt
   sprays. Greenhouse populations showed a pattern of isolation by distance
   and a strong positive relationship between genetic differentiation and
   levels of Bt resistance. These patterns indicate that greenhouses that
   sometimes support year-round populations of T. ni and the ensuing strong
   bottlenecking effects following winter cleanups and Bt application cause
   genetic differentiation of T. ni populations. Long distance migrants to
   field populations contribute to genetic homogeneity of these.}},

Abstract = {{While it is generally recognized that noncontiguous (long-distance)
   dispersal of small numbers of individuals is important for range
   expansion over large geographic areas, it is often assumed that
   colonization on more local scales proceeds by population expansion and
   diffusion dispersal (larger numbers of individuals colonizing adjacent
   sites). There are few empirical studies of dispersal modes at the front
   of expanding ranges, and very little information is available on
   dispersal dynamics at smaller geographic scales where we expect
   contiguous (diffusion) dispersal to be prevalent. We used highly
   polymorphic genetic markers to characterize dispersal modes at a local
   geographic scale for populations at the edge of the range of a newly
   invasive grass species (Brachypodium sylvaticum) that is undergoing
   rapid range expansion in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
   Comparisons of Bayesian clustering of populations, patterns of genetic
   diversity, and gametic disequilibrium indicate that new populations are
   colonized ahead of the invasion front by noncontiguous dispersal from
   source populations, with admixture occurring as populations age. This
   pattern of noncontiguous colonization was maintained even at a local
   scale. Absence of evidence for dispersal among adjacent pioneer sites at
   the edge of the expanding range of this species suggests that pioneer
   populations undergo an establishment phase during which they do not
   contribute emigrants for colonization of neighbouring sites. Our data
   indicate that dispersal modes change as the invasion matures: initial
   colonization processes appear to be dominated by noncontiguous dispersal
   from only a few sources, while contiguous dispersal may play a greater
   role once populations become established.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of contemporary populations can be shaped by both
   their history and current ecological conditions. We assessed the
   relative importance of postglacial colonization history and habitat type
   in the patterns and degree of genetic diversity and differentiation in
   northern European nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius), using
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 12 nuclear microsatellite and
   insertion/deletion loci. The mtDNA analyses identified - and
   microsatellite analyses supported - the existence of two historically
   distinct lineages (eastern and western). The analyses of nuclear loci
   among 51 European sites revealed clear historically influenced and to
   minor degree habitat dependent, patterns of genetic diversity and
   differentiation. While the effect of habitat type on the levels of
   genetic variation (coastal > freshwater) and differentiation (freshwater
   > coastal) was clear, the levels of genetic variability and
   differentiation in the freshwater sites were independent of habitat type
   (viz. river, lake and pond). However, levels of genetic variability,
   together with estimates of historical effective population sizes,
   decreased dramatically and linearly with increasing latitude. These
   geographical patterns of genetic variability and differentiation suggest
   that the contemporary genetic structure of freshwater nine-spined
   sticklebacks has been strongly impacted by the founder events associated
   with postglacial colonization and less by current ecological conditions
   (cf. habitat type). In general, the results highlight the strong and
   persistent effects of postglacial colonization history on genetic
   structuring of northern European fauna and provide an unparalleled
   example of latitudinal trends in levels of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of fine scale genetic structure in continuous populations of
   outcrossing plant species has traditionally been limited by the
   availability of sufficient markers. We used a set of 468 SNPs to
   characterize fine-scale genetic structure within and between two dense
   stands of the wild ancestor of maize, teosinte (Zea mays ssp.
   parviglumis). Our analyses confirmed that teosinte is highly outcrossing
   and showed little population structure over short distances. We found
   that the two populations were clearly genetically differentiated,
   although the actual level of differentiation was low. Spatial
   autocorrelation of relatedness was observed within both sites but was
   somewhat stronger in one of the populations. Using principal component
   analysis, we found evidence for significant local differentiation in the
   population with stronger spatial autocorrelation. This differentiation
   was associated with pronounced shifts in the first two principal
   components along the field. These shifts corresponded to changes in
   allele frequencies, potentially due to local topographical features.
   There was little evidence for selection at individual loci as a
   contributing factor to differentiation. Our results demonstrate that
   significant local differentiation may, but need not, co-occur with
   spatial autocorrelation of relatedness. The present study represents one
   of the most detailed analyses of local genetic structure to date and
   provides a benchmark for future studies dealing with fine scale patterns
   of genetic diversity in natural plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{A mutualistic relationship between reef-building corals and
   endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) forms the basis for
   the existence of coral reefs. Genotyping tools for Symbiodinium spp.
   have added a new level of complexity to studies concerning cnidarian
   growth, nutrient acquisition, and stress. For example, the response of
   the coral holobiont to thermal stress is connected to the
   host-Symbiodinium genotypic combination, as different partnerships can
   have different bleaching susceptibilities. In this study, we monitored
   Symbiodinium physiological parameters and profiled the coral host
   transcriptional responses in acclimated, thermally stressed, and
   recovered fragments of the coral Montastraea faveolata using a custom
   cDNA gene expression microarray. Interestingly, gene expression was more
   similar among samples with the same Symbiodinium content rather than the
   same experimental condition. In order to discount for host-genotypic
   effects, we sampled fragments from a single colony of M. faveolata
   containing different symbiont types, and found that the host
   transcriptomic states grouped according to Symbiodinium genotype rather
   than thermal stress. As the first study that links coral host
   transcriptomic patterns to the clade content of their Symbiodinium
   community, our results provide a critical step to elucidating the
   molecular basis of the apparent variability seen among different
   coral-Symbiodinium partnerships.}},

Abstract = {{Association studies utilize the action of recombination over numerous
   generations to identify loci that underlie quantitative traits. We use a
   candidate-gene association approach, segregation analyses and analyses
   of local linkage disequilibrium (LD) to evaluate the potentially causal
   effects of molecular variation at PIF4 (PHYTOCROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4)
   on ecologically important traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. A preliminary
   analysis of sequence diversity in 14 natural genotypes revealed one
   intermediate-frequency replacement polymorphism at PIF4. A sample of 161
   natural accessions was genotyped at PIF4 and screened for average length
   of early internodes, inflorescence length, days to flowering and
   flowering interval (days between bolting and flowering) under high- and
   low-density environments to test for genotype-phenotype associations.
   PIF4 was associated with early internode lengths, while the PIF4x
   treatment interaction was associated with flowering interval in the
   panel of 161 accessions. Further, in a set of recombinant inbred lines
   that segregate for the PIF4 polymorphism, nucleotide substitutions at
   PIF4 co-segregated with early internode lengths, days to flowering and
   fruit set, suggesting that cryptic population structure in the
   association-mapping panel and attendant LD with a physically distant
   locus do not account for the observed association. Finally, in a panel
   of pseudochromosomes from 20 re-sequenced genotypes, LD appeared to
   decay rapidly in the immediate vicinity of PIF4, suggesting that
   flanking loci contribute little to the observed association. In sum, the
   results suggest that PIF4 causally affects early internode lengths on
   the primary inflorescence, potentially via effects on reproductive
   timing and that these traits in turn affect fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In species with social hierarchies, the death of dominant individuals
   typically upheaves the social hierarchy and provides an opportunity for
   subordinate individuals to become reproductives. Such a phenomenon
   occurs in the monogyne form of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, where
   colonies typically contain a single wingless reproductive queen,
   thousands of workers and hundreds of winged nonreproductive virgin
   queens. Upon the death of the mother queen, many virgin queens shed
   their wings and initiate reproductive development instead of departing
   on a mating flight. Workers progressively execute almost all of them
   over the following weeks. To identify the molecular changes that occur
   in virgin queens as they perceive the loss of their mother queen and
   begin to compete for reproductive dominance, we collected virgin queens
   before the loss of their mother queen, 6 h after orphaning and 24 h
   after orphaning. Their RNA was extracted and hybridized against
   microarrays to examine the expression levels of approximately 10 000
   genes. We identified 297 genes that were consistently differentially
   expressed after orphaning. These include genes that are putatively
   involved in the signalling and onset of reproductive development, as
   well as genes underlying major physiological changes in the young
   queens.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid range expansions can cause pervasive changes in the genetic
   diversity and structure of populations. The postglacial history of the
   Balsam Poplar, Populus balsamifera, involved the colonization of most of
   northern North America, an area largely covered by continental ice
   sheets during the last glacial maximum. To characterize how this
   expansion shaped genomic diversity within and among populations, we
   developed 412 SNP markers that we assayed for a range-wide sample of 474
   individuals sampled from 34 populations. We complemented the SNP data
   set with DNA sequence data from 11 nuclear loci from 94 individuals, and
   used coalescent analyses to estimate historical population size,
   demographic growth, and patterns of migration. Bayesian clustering
   identified three geographically separated demes found in the Northern,
   Central, and Eastern portions of the species' range. These demes varied
   significantly in nucleotide diversity, the abundance of private
   polymorphisms, and population substructure. Most measures supported the
   Central deme as descended from the primary refuge of diversity. Both
   SNPs and sequence data suggested recent population growth, and
   coalescent analyses of historical migration suggested a massive
   expansion from the Centre to the North and East. Collectively, these
   data demonstrate the strong influence that range expansions exert on
   genomic diversity, both within local populations and across the range.
   Our results suggest that an in-depth knowledge of nucleotide diversity
   following expansion requires sampling within multiple populations, and
   highlight the utility of combining insights from different data types in
   population genomic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, parthenogenetic reproduction has evolved many times in the
   stick insects (Phasmatidae). Many parthenogenetic stick insects show the
   distribution pattern known as geographic parthenogenesis, in that they
   occupy habitats that are at higher altitude or latitude compared with
   their sexual relatives. Although it is often assumed that, in the short
   term, parthenogenetic populations will have a reproductive advantage
   over sexual populations; this is not necessarily the case. We present
   data on the distribution and evolutionary relationships of sexual and
   asexual populations of the New Zealand stick insect, Clitarchus hookeri.
   Males are common in the northern half of the species' range but rare or
   absent elsewhere, and we found that most C. hookeri from
   putative-parthenogenetic populations share a common ancestor. Female
   stick insects from bisexual populations of Clitarchus hookeri are
   capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, but those insects from
   putative-parthenogenetic populations produced few offspring via sexual
   reproduction when males were available. We found similar fertility
   (hatching success) in mated and virgin females. Mated females produce
   equal numbers of male and female offspring, with most hatching about
   9-16 weeks after laying. In contrast, most eggs from unmated females
   took longer to hatch (21-23 weeks), and most offspring were female. It
   appears that all C. hookeri females are capable of parthenogenetic
   reproduction, and thus could benefit from the numerical advantage this
   yields. Nevertheless, our phylogeographic evidence shows that the
   majority of all-female populations over a wide geographic area originate
   from a single loss of sexual reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Range-wide variation in 54 populations of Dahurian larch (Larix
   gmelinii) and related taxa in Northeast Asia was assessed with four
   mitochondrial PCR-RFLP and five chloroplast SSR markers. Eleven
   mitotypes and 115 chlorotypes were detected. The highest diversity was
   observed in the southern Russian Far East where hybrids of L. gmelinii,
   L. olgensis and L. kamtschatica are distributed. In contrast, only two
   mitotypes occurred in L. cajanderi and L. gmelinii. The Japanese larch
   (L. kaempferi) was found to be closely related to populations of L.
   kamtschatica inhabiting the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin,
   populations from the northern part of Sakhalin being more closely
   related to continental species. In general, both mitochondrial (G(ST) =
   0.786; N(ST) = 0.823) and chloroplast (G(ST) = 0.144; R(ST) = 0.432)
   markers showed a strong phylogeographical structure and evidence of
   isolation-by-distance. Yet both markers did not allow a clear
   delineation of species borders. In particular, and contrary to
   expectations, cpDNA was not significantly better than mtDNA at
   delineating species borders. This lack of concordance between
   morphological species and molecular markers could reflect extensive
   ancestral haplotype sharing and past and ongoing introgression. Finally
   the distribution of mtDNA and cpDNA variation suggests the presence of
   several refugia during Pleistocene glacial intervals. In particular,
   mtDNA and cpDNA reveal weak but visible differentiation between L.
   gmelinii and L. cajanderi, suggesting independent glacial histories of
   these species.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Much thought has been given to the individual-level traits that may make
   a species a successful colonizer. However, these traits have proven to
   be weak predictors of colonization success. Here, we test whether
   population-level characteristics, specifically genetic diversity and
   population density, can influence colonization ability on a short-term
   ecological timescale, independent of longer-term effects on adaptive
   potential. Within experimentally manipulated populations of the weedy
   herb Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that increased genetic diversity
   increased colonization success measured as population-level seedling
   emergence rates, biomass production, flowering duration, and
   reproduction. Additive and non-additive effects contributed to these
   responses, suggesting that both individual genotypes (sampling effect)
   and positive interactions among genotypes (complementarity) contributed
   to increased colonization success. In contrast, manipulation of plant
   density had no effect on colonization success. The heightened ability of
   relatively genetically rich populations to colonize novel habitats, if a
   general phenomenon, may have important implications for predicting and
   controlling biological invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolutionary causes of phenotypic variation among
   populations has long been a central theme in evolutionary biology.
   Several factors can influence phenotypic divergence, including
   geographic isolation, genetic drift, divergent natural or sexual
   selection, and phenotypic plasticity. But the relative importance of
   these factors in generating phenotypic divergence in nature is still a
   tantalizing and unresolved problem in evolutionary biology. The origin
   and maintenance of phenotypic divergence is also at the root of many
   ongoing debates in evolutionary biology, such as the extent to which
   gene flow constrains adaptive divergence (Garant et al. 2007) and the
   relative importance of genetic drift, natural selection, and sexual
   selection in initiating reproductive isolation and speciation (Coyne \&
   Orr 2004). In this issue, Wang \& Summers (2010) test the causes of one
   of the most fantastic examples of phenotypic divergence in nature:
   colour pattern divergence among populations of the strawberry poison
   frog (Dendrobates pumilio) in Panama and Costa Rica (Fig. 1). This study
   provides a beautiful example of the use of the emerging field of
   landscape genetics to differentiate among hypotheses for phenotypic
   divergence. Using landscape genetic analyses, Wang \& Summers were able
   to reject the hypotheses that colour pattern divergence is due to
   isolation-by-distance (IBD) or landscape resistance. Instead, the
   hypothesis left standing is that colour divergence is due to divergent
   selection, in turn driving reproductive isolation among populations with
   different colour morphs. More generally, this study provides a wonderful
   example of how the emerging field of landscape genetics, which has
   primarily been applied to questions in conservation and ecology, now
   plays an essential role in evolutionary research.}},

Abstract = {{Recent papers have promoted the view that model-based methods in
   general, and those based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) in
   particular, are flawed in a number of ways, and are therefore
   inappropriate for the analysis of phylogeographic data. These papers
   further argue that Nested Clade Phylogeographic Analysis (NCPA) offers
   the best approach in statistical phylogeography. In order to remove the
   confusion and misconceptions introduced by these papers, we justify and
   explain the reasoning behind model-based inference. We argue that ABC is
   a statistically valid approach, alongside other computational
   statistical techniques that have been successfully used to infer
   parameters and compare models in population genetics. We also examine
   the NCPA method and highlight numerous deficiencies, either when used
   with single or multiple loci. We further show that the ages of clades
   are carelessly used to infer ages of demographic events, that these ages
   are estimated under a simple model of panmixia and population
   stationarity but are then used under different and unspecified models to
   test hypotheses, a usage the invalidates these testing procedures. We
   conclude by encouraging researchers to study and use model-based
   inference in population genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic and genetic divergence can be influenced by a variety of
   factors, including sexual and natural selection, genetic drift and
   geographic isolation. Investigating the roles of these factors in
   natural systems can provide insight into the relative influences of
   allopatric and ecological modes of biological diversification in nature.
   The strawberry poison frog, Dendrobates pumilio, presents an excellent
   opportunity for this kind of research, displaying a diverse array of
   colour morphs and inhabiting a heterogeneous landscape that includes
   oceanic islands, fragmented rainforest patches and wide expanses of
   suitable habitat. In this study, we use 15 highly polymorphic
   microsatellite loci to estimate population structure and gene flow among
   populations from across the range of D. pumilio and a causal modelling
   framework to statistically test 12 hypotheses regarding the geographic
   and phenotypic variables that explain genetic differentiation within
   this system. Our results demonstrate that the genetic distance between
   populations is most strongly associated with differences in dorsal
   coloration. Previous experimental studies have shown that phenotypic
   differences can result in sexual and natural selection against
   non-native phenotypes, and our results now show that these forces lead
   to genetic isolation between different colour morphs in the wild,
   presenting a potential case of incipient speciation through selection.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{459-471}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Spatial genetic structure (SGS) results from the interplay of several
   demographical processes that are difficult to tease apart. In this
   study, we explore the specific effects of seed and pollen dispersal and
   of early postdispersal mortality on the SGS of a seedling cohort (N =
   786) recruiting within and around an expanding pedunculate oak (Quercus
   robur) stand. Using data on dispersal (derived from parentage analysis)
   and mortality (monitored in the field through two growing seasons), we
   decompose the overall SGS of the cohort into its components by
   contrasting the SGS of dispersed (i.e. growing away from their mother
   tree) vs. nondispersed (i.e. growing beneath their mother tree) and
   initial vs. surviving seedlings. Patterns differ strongly between
   nondispersed and dispersed seedlings. Nondispersed seedlings are largely
   responsible for the positive kinship values observed at short distances
   in the studied population, whereas dispersed seedlings determine the
   overall SGS at distances beyond c. 30 m. The paternal alleles of
   nondispersed seedlings show weak yet significantly positive kinships up
   to c. 15 m, indicating some limitations in pollen flow that should
   further promote pedigree structures at short distances. Seedling
   mortality does not alter SGS, except for a slight increase in the
   nondispersed group. Field data reveal that mortality in this group is
   negatively density-dependent, probably because of small-scale variation
   in light conditions. Finally, we observe a remarkable similarity between
   the SGS of the dispersed seedlings and that of the adults, which
   probably reflects dispersal processes during the initial expansion of
   the population. Overall, this study demonstrates that incorporating
   individual-level complementary information into analyses can greatly
   improve the detail and confidence of ecological inferences drawn from
   SGS.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic consequences of population fragmentation and isolation are
   major issues in conservation biology. In this study we analyse the
   genetic variability and structure of the Iberian populations of
   Mioscirtus wagneri, a specialized grasshopper exclusively inhabiting
   highly fragmented hypersaline low grounds. For this purpose we have used
   seven species-specific microsatellite markers to type 478 individuals
   from 24 localities and obtain accurate estimates of their genetic
   variability. Genetic diversity was relatively low and we detected
   genetic signatures suggesting that certain populations of M. wagneri
   have probably passed through severe demographic bottlenecks. We have
   found that the populations of this grasshopper show a strong genetic
   structure even at small geographical scales, indicating that they mostly
   behave as isolated populations with low levels of gene flow among them.
   Thus, several populations can be regarded as independent and genetically
   differentiated units which require adequate conservation strategies to
   avoid eventual extinctions that in highly isolated localities are not
   likely to be compensated for with the arrival of immigrants from
   neighbouring populations. Overall, our results show that these
   populations probably represent the `fragments' of a formerly more
   widespread population and highlight the importance of protecting Iberian
   hypersaline environments due to the high number of rare and endangered
   species they sustain.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Some species of sea urchins feature large variation in pigmentation.
   This variability may be the result of phenotypic plasticity or it may be
   associated with genetic divergence between morphs. Paracentrotus
   gaimardi exhibits five colour morphs (pink, brown, green, grey and
   black), which often occur side by side on the same rock. We studied
   genetic divergence between these morphs in three populations on the
   coast of Brazil. A fragment of the region encoding the mitochondrial
   ATPase 8 and 6 mitochondrial genes, a fragment of the intron of a
   nuclear histone and the entire nuclear gene coding for the sperm protein
   bindin were analysed. Mitochondrial DNA was differentiated between the
   pink and all other morphs, but the histone intron was similar in all
   colour morphs. In bindin, nine codons were found to be under positive
   selection and significant differences of allelic frequencies were
   observed in almost all pairwise comparisons between colour morphs.
   Although the molecular differentiation in bindin is not large enough to
   suggest reproductive isolation, some degree of assortative mating within
   morphs seems to be occurring in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Allopatry is conventionally considered the geographical mode of
   speciation for continental island organisms. However, strictly
   allopatric speciation models that assume the lack of postdivergence gene
   flow seem oversimplified given the recurrence of land bridges during
   glacial periods since the late Pliocene. Here, to evaluate whether a
   continental island endemic, the Taiwan hwamei (Leucodioptron taewanus,
   Passeriformes Timaliidae) speciated in strict allopatry, we used
   weighted-regression-based approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to
   analyse the genetic polymorphism of 18 neutral nuclear loci (total
   length: 8500 bp) in Taiwan hwamei and its continental sister species,
   the Chinese hwamei (L. canorum canorum). The nonallopatry model was
   found to fit better with observed genetic polymorphism of the two hwamei
   species (posterior possibility = 0.82). We also recovered unambiguous
   signals of nontrivial bidirectional postdivergence gene flow (N(e)m>>1)
   between Chinese hwamei and Taiwan hwamei until 0.5 Ma. Divergence time
   was estimated to be 3.5 to 2 million years earlier than that estimated
   from mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Finally, using the inferred
   nonallopatry model to simulate genetic variation at 24 nuclear genes
   examined showed that the adiponectin receptor 1 gene may be under
   divergent adaptation. Our findings imply that the role of geographical
   barrier may be less prominent for the speciation of continental island
   endemics, and suggest a shift in speciation studies from simply
   correlating geographical barrier and genetic divergence to examining
   factors that facilitate and maintain divergence, e. g. differential
   selection and sexual selection, especially in the face of
   interpopulation gene flow.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{508-520}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Populations of obligately estuarine taxa are potentially small and
   isolated and may lack genetic variation and display regional
   differentiation as a result of drift and inbreeding. Hybridization with
   a wide-ranging marine congener should introduce genetic variation and
   reduce the effects of inbreeding depression and genetic drift. However,
   high levels of hybridization can cause demographic and genetic swamping.
   In southeastern Australia hybridization occurs between obligately
   estuarine Black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) and migratory marine
   Yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis). Here, we surveyed genetic
   variation at eight microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control
   region of juvenile fish from five coastal lagoons (including temporal
   replication in two lagoons) (total n = 970) to determine the frequency
   and persistence of hybridization, and its likely consequence for the
   estuarine restricted A. butcheri. Of 688 juvenile fish genotyped 95\%
   were either A. australis (347) or hybrids (309); only 5\% (32) were A.
   butcheri. Most hybrids were later generation hybrids or A. butcheri
   backcrosses, which are likely multi-generational residents within
   lagoons. Far greater proportions of hybrid juveniles were found within
   two lagoons that are generally closed to the ocean (> 90\% hybrid fish
   within generally closed lagoons vs. 12-27\% in permanently or
   intermittently open lagoons). In both lagoons, this was consistent
   across multiple cohorts of fish {[}79-97\% hybrid fish (n = 282)].
   Hybridization and introgression represent a major threat to the
   persistence of A. butcheri and have yet to be investigated for large
   numbers of estuarine taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Although the sexual transfer of genetic material between species (i.e.
   introgression) has been documented in many groups of plants and animals,
   genome-wide patterns of introgression are poorly understood. Is most of
   the genome permeable to interspecific gene flow, or is introgression
   typically restricted to a handful of genomic regions? Here, we assess
   the genomic extent and direction of introgression between three
   sunflowers from the south-central USA: the common sunflower, Helianthus
   annuus ssp. annuus; a near-endemic to Texas, Helianthus debilis ssp.
   cucumerifolius; and their putative hybrid derivative, thought to have
   recently colonized Texas, H. annuus ssp. texanus. Analyses of variation
   at 88 genetically mapped microsatellite loci revealed that long-term
   migration rates were high, genome-wide and asymmetric, with higher
   migration rates from H. annuus texanus into the two parental taxa than
   vice versa. These results imply a longer history of intermittent contact
   between H. debilis and H. annuus than previously believed, and that H.
   annuus texanus may serve as a bridge for the transfer of alleles between
   its parental taxa. They also contradict recent theory suggesting that
   introgression should predominantly be in the direction of the colonizing
   species. As in previous studies of hybridizing sunflower species,
   regions of genetic differentiation appear small, whether estimated in
   terms of FST or unidirectional migration rates. Estimates of recent
   immigration and admixture were inconsistent, depending on the type of
   analysis. At the individual locus level, one marker showed striking
   asymmetry in migration rates, a pattern consistent with tight linkage to
   a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{The historical biogeography of California's taxa has been the focus of
   extensive research effort. The western pond turtle (Emys marmorata) is
   an example of a wide-ranging taxon that spans several well-known
   California diversity hotspots. Using a dataset comprised of one
   mitochondrial and five nuclear loci, we elucidate the major
   biogeographic patterns of the western pond turtle across the California
   landscape. By employing a combination of phylogenetic and network-based
   approaches, we recovered a relatively ancient (c. 2-8 Ma) north/south
   split among populations of E. marmorata and find an area of
   intergradation centred in the Central Coast Ranges of California. In
   addition, discordant mitochondrial/nuclear genetic patterns suggest
   subsequent gene flow from northern populations and from San Joaquin
   Valley populations into the Central Coast Ranges after the
   Pliocene-Pleistocene marine embayment of the Great Central Valley
   subsided. Our results emphasize the utility of nuclear DNA
   phylogeography for recovering the impact of relatively ancient
   biogeographic events, and suggest that the Central Coast Ranges of
   California have played a major role in the geographic structuring of the
   western pond turtle, and possibly other co-distributed taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean Sea is a two-basin system, with the boundary zone
   restricted to the Strait of Sicily and the narrow Strait of Messina. Two
   main population groups are recognized in the Mediterranean endemic
   seagrass Posidonia oceanica, corresponding to the Western and the
   Eastern basins. To address the nature of the East-West cleavage in P.
   oceanica, the main aims of this study were: (i) to define the genetic
   structure within the potential contact zone (i. e. the Strait of Sicily)
   and clarify the extent of gene flow between the two population groups,
   and (ii) to investigate the role of present water circulation patterns
   vs. past evolutionary events on the observed genetic pattern. To achieve
   these goals, we utilized SSR markers and we simulated, with respect to
   current regime, the possible present-day dispersal pattern of Posidonia
   floating fruits using 28-day numerical Lagrangian trajectories. The
   results obtained confirm the presence of the two main population groups,
   without any indices of reproductive isolation, with the break zone
   located at the level of the Southern tip of Calabria. The populations in
   the Strait of Sicily showed higher affinity with Western than with
   Eastern populations. This pattern of genetic structure probably reflects
   historical avenues of recolonization from relict glacial areas and past
   vicariance events, but seems to persist as a result of the low
   connectivity among populations via marine currents, as suggested by our
   dispersal simulation analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater mussels (unionids) are increasingly recognized as important
   providers of ecosystem services, yet are among the most endangered fauna
   in the world. Because unionids are generally sessile and require
   specific fish hosts for development and dispersal, they are particularly
   vulnerable to habitat degradation. Surprisingly, little is known about
   the distribution of genetic diversity in freshwater mussels and this gap
   has a negative impact on taxonomy, monitoring, conservation and
   ecological research in these species. Here, we focus on western North
   American Anodonta, one of only three genera known to exist in this broad
   landscape and which contains three highly divergent lineages. We
   describe phylogeographical subdivision in the most widespread and
   diverse of these lineages, which includes Anodonta californiensis and
   Anodonta nuttalliana and occurs from Canada to Mexico. Using
   mitochondrial and nuclear data, we found that genetic structuring within
   this clade is inconsistent with morphologically based species
   designations, but instead follows patterns of vicariance among major
   hydrogeologic basins. Furthermore, there was a strong tendency for
   population diversity within drainage systems to increase downstream,
   implying greater habitat or host fish availability in this direction.
   Microsatellite results indicated that sampling locations were all
   genetically distinct, even at short distances. Many of our sample
   populations showed evidence of a recent demographic bottleneck, although
   this effect seemed to be very local and not drainage or basin-specific.
   This study provides a foundation for the establishment of appropriate
   management units and future research on adaptive differentiation and
   host fish relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the evolutionary history of most complex
   multi-trophic insect communities. Widespread species from different
   trophic levels might evolve in parallel, showing similar spatial
   patterns and either congruent temporal patterns (Contemporary
   Host-tracking) or later divergence in higher trophic levels (Delayed
   Host-tracking). Alternatively, host shifts by natural enemies among
   communities centred on different host resources could disrupt any common
   community phylogeographic pattern. We examined these alternative models
   using two Megastigmus parasitoid morphospecies associated with oak
   cynipid galls sampled throughout their Western Palaearctic
   distributions. Based on existing host cynipid data, a parallel evolution
   model predicts that eastern regions of the Western Palaearctic should
   contain ancestral populations with range expansions across Europe about
   1.6 million years ago and deeper species-level divergence at both 8-9
   and 4-5 million years ago. Sequence data from mitochondrial cytochrome b
   and multiple nuclear genes showed similar phylogenetic patterns and
   revealed cryptic genetic species within both morphospecies, indicating
   greater diversity in these communities than previously thought.
   Phylogeographic divergence was apparent in most cryptic species between
   relatively stable, diverse, putatively ancestral populations in Asia
   Minor and the Middle East, and genetically depauperate, rapidly
   expanding populations in Europe, paralleling patterns in host gallwasp
   species. Mitochondrial and nuclear data also suggested that Europe may
   have been colonized multiple times from eastern source populations since
   the late Miocene. Temporal patterns of lineage divergence were congruent
   within and across trophic levels, supporting the Contemporary
   Host-tracking Hypothesis for community evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of mate choice depends on complex interactions between males
   and females both before and after copulation. Although the competition
   between males for access to mates and premating choice by females are
   relatively well understood, the nature of interactions between cryptic
   female choice and male sperm competition within the female reproductive
   tract is less clear. Understanding the complexity of post-copulatory
   sexual selection requires an understanding of how anatomy, physiology
   and behaviour mediate sperm transfer and storage within multiply mated
   females. Here we use a newly developed molecular technique to directly
   quantify mixed sperm stores in multiple mating females of the black
   field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. In this species, female
   postcopulatory choice is easily observed and manipulated as females
   delay the removal of the spermatophore in favour of preferred males.
   Using twice-mated females, we find that the proportion of sperm in the
   spermatheca attributed to the second male to mate with a female (S(2))
   increases linearly with the time of spermatophore attachment. Moreover,
   we show that the insemination success of a male increases with its
   attractiveness and decreases with the size of the female. The effect of
   male attractiveness in this context suggests a previously unknown
   episode of mate choice in this species that reinforces the sexual
   selection imposed by premating choice and conflicts with the outcome of
   postmating male harassment. Our results provide some of the clearest
   evidence yet for how sperm transfer and displacement in multiply mated
   females can lead directly to cryptic female choice, and that three
   distinct periods of sexual selection operate in black field crickets.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{621-623}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{From early allozyme work to recent genome-wide scans, many studies have
   reported associations between molecular markers and latitude. These
   geographic patterns are tantalizing because they hint at the possibility
   of identifying specific mutations responsible for climatic adaptation.
   Unfortunately, few studies have done so because these exciting first
   glances often prove extremely challenging to follow up. Many
   difficulties can hinder connecting genetic and phenotypic variation in
   this context, and without such links, distinguishing the action of
   spatially varying selection from the other evolutionary processes
   capable of generating these patterns can be quite thorny. Nevertheless,
   two papers in this issue report excellent progress in overcoming these
   obstacles and provide persuasive evidence supporting the involvement of
   specific natural variants in clinal adaptation of Drosophila
   melanogaster populations (Fig. 1). In the first paper, Paaby et al.
   (2010) describe replicated allele frequency clines for a coding
   polymorphism in the Insulin-like Receptor (InR) gene on two continents,
   findings that strongly point to selection acting at this locus and that
   likely reflect life history adaptation. McKechnie et al. (2010) report
   compelling functional evidence that cis-regulatory variation in the Dca
   (drosophila cold acclimation) gene contributes to an adaptive cline in
   wing size. Notably, these papers employ largely alternative and
   complementary approaches, and together they exemplify how diverse
   strategies may be interwoven to draw convincing connections between
   genotype, phenotype, and evolutionary process.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{624-626}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Identifying the genes that underlie phenotypic variation in natural
   populations, and assessing the consequences of polymorphisms at these
   loci for individual fitness are major objectives in evolutionary
   biology. Yet, with the exception of a few success stories, little
   progress has been made, and our understanding of the link between
   genotype and phenotype is still in its infancy. For example, although
   body length in humans is largely genetically determined, with
   heritability estimates greater than 0.8, massive genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) have only been able to account for a very small
   proportion of this variation (Gudbjartsson et al. 2008). If it is so
   difficult to explain the genetics behind relatively `simple' traits, can
   we envision that it will at all be possible to find genes underlying
   complex behavioural traits in wild non-model organisms? Some notable
   examples suggest that this can indeed be a worthwhile endeavour.
   Recently, the circadian rhythm gene Clock has been associated with
   timing of breeding in a wild blue tit population (Johnsen et al. 2007;
   Liedvogel et al. 2009) and the Pgi gene to variation in dispersal and
   flight endurance in Glanville fritillary butterflies (Niitepold et al.
   2009). A promising candidate gene for influencing complex animal
   personality traits, also known as behavioural syndromes (Sih et al.
   2004), is the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene. Within the last decade,
   polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with variation in
   novelty seeking and exploration behaviour in a range of species, from
   humans to great tits (Schinka et al. 2002; Fidler et al. 2007). In this
   issue, Korsten et al. (2010) attempt to replicate this previously
   observed association in wild-living birds, and test for the generality
   of the association between DRD4 and personality across a number of
   European great tit populations.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The great diversity of sex determination mechanisms in animals and
   plants ranges from genetic sex determination (GSD, e.g. mammals, birds,
   and most dioecious plants) to environmental sex determination (ESD, e.g.
   many reptiles) and includes a mixture of both, for example when an
   individual's genetically determined sex is environmentally reversed
   during ontogeny (ESR, environmental sex reversal, e.g. many fish and
   amphibia). ESD and ESR can lead to widely varying and unstable
   population sex ratios. Populations exposed to conditions such as
   endocrine-active substances or temperature shifts may decline over time
   due to skewed sex ratios, a scenario that may become increasingly
   relevant with greater anthropogenic interference on watercourses.
   Continuous exposure of populations to factors causing ESR could lead to
   the extinction of genetic sex factors and may render a population
   dependent on the environmental factors that induce the sex change.
   However, ESR also presents opportunities for population management,
   especially if the Y or W chromosome is not, or not severely,
   degenerated. This seems to be the case in many amphibians and fish.
   Population growth or decline in such species can potentially be
   controlled through the introduction of so-called Trojan sex genes
   carriers, individuals that possess sex chromosomes or genes opposite
   from what their phenotype predicts. Here, we review the conditions for
   ESR, its prevalence in natural populations, the resulting physiological
   and reproductive consequences, and how these may become instrumental for
   population management.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{647-657}},

Abstract = {{We investigated local genetic associations among female Pacific common
   eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) nesting in a stochastic Arctic
   environment within two groups of barrier islands (Simpson Lagoon and
   Mikkelsen Bay) in the Beaufort Sea, Alaska. Nonrandom genetic
   associations were observed among nesting females using regional spatial
   autocorrelation analyses for distance classes up to 1000 m in Simpson
   Lagoon. Nearest- neighbour analyses identified clusters of genetically
   related females with positive lr values observed for 0-13\% and 0-7\% of
   the comparisons in Simpson Lagoon and Mikkelsen Bay, respectively,
   across years. These results indicate that a proportion of females are
   nesting in close proximity to more genetically related individuals,
   albeit at low frequency. Such kin groupings may form through active
   association between relatives or through natal philopatry and breeding
   site fidelity. Eiders nest in close association with driftwood, which is
   redistributed annually by seasonal storms. Yet, genetic associations
   were still observed. Microgeographic structure may thus be more
   attributable to kin association than natal philopatry and site fidelity.
   However, habitat availability may also influence the level of structure
   observed. Regional structure was present only within Simpson Lagoon and
   this island group includes at least three islands with sufficient
   driftwood for colonies, whereas only one island at Mikkelsen Bay has
   these features. A long-term demographic study is needed to understand
   more fully the mechanisms that lead to fine-scale genetic structure
   observed in common eiders breeding in the Beaufort Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the impact of plant domestication on the population structure
   of the associated pathogens provides an opportunity to increase our
   understanding of how and why diseases emerge. Here, we investigated the
   evolution of the population structure of the apple scab fungus Venturia
   inaequalis in response to the domestication of its host. Inferences were
   drawn from multilocus microsatellite data obtained from samples
   collected on (i) the Central Asian Malus sieversii, the main progenitor
   of apple, (ii) the European crabapple, Malus sylvestris, a secondary
   progenitor of apple, and (iii) the cultivated apple, Malus x domestica,
   in orchards from Europe and Central Asia. Using clustering methods, we
   identified three distinct populations: (i) a large European population
   on domesticated and wild apples, (ii) a large Central Asian population
   on domesticated and wild apples in urban and agricultural areas, and
   (iii) a more geographically restricted population in M. sieversii
   forests growing in the eastern mountains of Kazakhstan. Unique allele
   richness and divergence time estimates supported a host-tracking
   co-evolutionary scenario in which this latter population represents a
   relict of the ancestral populations from which current populations found
   in human-managed habitats were derived. Our analyses indicated that the
   domestication of apple induced a significant change in the genetic
   differentiation of populations of V. inaequalis in its centre of origin,
   but had little impact on its population dynamics and mating system. We
   discuss how the structure of the apple-based agrosystem may have
   restricted changes in the population structure of the fungus in response
   to the domestication of its host.}},

Abstract = {{Combined action from over-harvesting and recent mass mortality events
   potentially linked to ongoing climate changes has led to new concerns
   for the conservation of shallow populations (5-60 m) of Corallium
   rubrum, an octocorallian that is mainly found in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The present study was designed to analyse population structure and
   relationships at different spatial scales (from 10s of meters to 100s of
   kilometres) with a focus on dispersal pattern. We also performed the
   first analysis of the distribution of genetic diversity using a
   comparative approach between regional-clusters and samples. Forty
   populations dwelling in four distinct regions between 14 and 60 m in
   depth were genotyped using 10 microsatellites. Our main results indicate
   (i) a generalized pair-sample differentiation combined with a weak
   structure between regional-clusters; (ii) the occurrence of isolation by
   distance at the global scale, but also within two of the three analysed
   regional-clusters; (iii) a high level of genetic diversity over the
   surveyed area with a heterogeneous distribution from regional-cluster to
   sample levels. The evolutionary consequences of these results are
   discussed and their management implications are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogen diversity is thought to drive major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) polymorphism given that host's immune repertories are dependent on
   antigen recognition capabilities. Here, we surveyed an extensive
   community of pathogens (n = 35 taxa) and MHC diversity in mainland
   versus island subspecies of the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus and
   in a sympatric mainland population of the phylogenetically related
   lesser kestrel Falco naumanni. Insular subspecies are commonly exposed
   to impoverished pathogen communities whilst different species' ecologies
   and contrasting life-history traits may lead to different levels of
   pathogen exposure. Although specific host traits may explain
   differential particular infections, overall pathogen diversity, richness
   and prevalence were higher in the truly cosmopolitan, euriphagous and
   long-distance disperser Eurasian kestrel than in the estenophagous,
   steppe-specialist, philopatric but long-distance migratory lesser
   kestrel. Accordingly, the continental population of Eurasian kestrels
   displayed a higher number (64 vs. 49) as well as more divergent alleles
   at both MHC class I and class II loci. Detailed analyses of amino acid
   diversity revealed that significant differences between both species
   were exclusive to those functionally important codons comprising the
   antigen binding sites. The lowest pathogen burdens and the smallest but
   still quite divergent set of MHC alleles (n = 16) were found in island
   Eurasian kestrels, where the rates of allele fixation at MHC loci seem
   to have occurred faster than at neutral markers. The results presented
   in this study would therefore support the role of pathogen diversity and
   abundance in shaping patterns of genetic variation at evolutionary
   relevant MHC genes.}},

Abstract = {{The dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans is a devastating basidiomycete
   occurring in wooden constructions in temperate regions worldwide. In
   this study, we compare the genetic structures of two invasive
   populations from Europe and Japan. Microsatellite data from 14 loci and
   DNA sequences from four loci demonstrated that the two populations were
   highly differentiated. Significant isolation by distance effect was
   observed in Europe and Japan. Higher genetic variation was observed
   within the Japanese population than within the European population,
   corresponding with the observed higher richness of vegetative
   compatibility types in Japan, indicating that there has been a higher
   level of gene flow from the Asian source populations to Japan than to
   Europe. The European population is genetically more homogenous with only
   six detected vegetative compatibility types. Various tests indicate that
   both the European and the Japanese populations have gone through
   population bottlenecks prior to population expansion. No identical
   multi-locus genotypes were observed within Japan and very few within
   Europe, indicating limited clonal dispersal. Deviations from Hardy
   Weinberg expectations were observed both in Europe and Japan and
   heterozygote excess were observed at several loci, especially in Europe.
   Possible explanations for this pattern are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In ectotherms, variation in life history traits among populations is
   common and suggests local adaptation. However, geographic variation
   itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene
   flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local
   and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life
   history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations
   from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially
   closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we
   compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (Q(ST)) obtained
   from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably
   neutral microsatellite markers (F(ST)). We found that R. temporaria
   populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in
   different temperatures at local, and in F(ST) at regional scale.
   Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular
   markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the
   divergence in growth and development rates as well as in
   temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at
   low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from
   selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but
   not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that
   local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among
   the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) exhibit different social
   behaviours at two regions in the Hawaiian Archipelago: off the high
   volcanic islands in the SE archipelago they form dynamic groups with
   ever-changing membership, but in the low carbonate atolls in the NW
   archipelago they form long-term stable groups. To determine whether
   these environmental and social differences influence population genetic
   structure, we surveyed spinner dolphins throughout the Hawaiian
   Archipelago with mtDNA control region sequences and 10 microsatellite
   loci (n = 505). F-statistics, Bayesian cluster analyses, and assignment
   tests revealed population genetic separations between most islands, with
   less genetic structuring among the NW atolls than among the SE high
   islands. The populations with the most stable social structure (Midway
   and Kure Atolls) have the highest gene flow between populations (mtDNA
   Phi(ST) < 0.001, P = 0.357; microsatellite F-ST = -0.001; P = 0.597),
   and a population with dynamic groups and fluid social structure (the
   Kona Coast of the island of Hawai'i) has the lowest gene flow (mtDNA
   0.042 < Phi(ST) < 0.236, P < 0.05; microsatellite 0.016 < F-ST < 0.040,
   P < 0.001). We suggest that gene flow, dispersal, and social structure
   are influenced by the availability of habitat and resources at each
   island. Genetic comparisons to a South Pacific location (n = 16)
   indicate that Hawaiian populations are genetically depauperate and
   isolated from other Pacific locations (mtDNA 0.216 < F-ST < 0.643, P <
   0.001; microsatellite 0.058 < F-ST < 0.090, P < 0.001); this isolation
   may also influence social and genetic structure within Hawai'i. Our
   results illustrate that genetic and social structure are flexible traits
   that can vary between even closely-related populations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the various ecosystemic services sustained by soil is pollutant
   degradation mediated by adapted soil bacteria. The pathways of atrazine
   biodegradation have been elucidated but in situ expression of the genes
   involved in atrazine degradation has yet to be demonstrated in soil.
   Expression of the atzA and atzD genes involved in atrazine
   dechlorination and s-triazine ring cleavage, respectively, was
   investigated during in situ degradation of atrazine in the soil
   drilosphere and bulked samples from two agricultural soils that differed
   in their ability to mineralize atrazine. Interestingly, expression of
   the atzA gene, although present in both soils, was not detected.
   Atrazine mineralization was greatest in Epoisses soil, where a larger
   pool of atzD mRNA was consistently measured 7 days after atrazine
   treatment, compared with Vezin soil (146 vs. 49 mRNA per 10(6) 16S rRNA,
   respectively). Expression of the atzD gene varied along the degradation
   time course and was profoundly modified in soil bioturbated by
   earthworms. The atzD mRNA pool was the highest in the soil drilosphere
   (casts and burrow-linings) and it was significantly different in
   burrow-linings compared with bulk soil (e. g. 363 vs. 146 mRNA per 10(6)
   16S rRNA, 7 days after atrazine treatment in Epoisses soil). Thus,
   consistent differences in atrazine mineralization were demonstrated
   between the soil drilosphere and bulk soil. However, the impact of
   bioturbation on atrazine mineralization depended on soil type.
   Mineralization was enhanced in casts, compared with bulk soil, from
   Epoisses soil but in burrow-linings from Vezin soil. This study is the
   first to report the effects of soil bioturbation by earthworms on
   s-triazine ring cleavage and its spatial variability in soil.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{760-774}},

Abstract = {{Life history traits are critical components of fitness and frequently
   reflect adaptive responses to environmental pressures. However, few
   genes that contribute to natural life history variation have been
   identified. Insulin signalling mediates the determination of life
   history traits in many organisms, and single gene manipulation in
   Drosophila melanogaster suggests that individual genes in the pathway
   have the potential to produce major effects on these quantitative
   traits. We evaluated allelic variation at two insulin signalling genes,
   the Insulin-like Receptor (InR) and its substrate, chico, in natural
   populations of D. melanogaster. We found different patterns of
   variation: InR shows evidence of positive selection and clines in allele
   frequency across latitude; chico exhibits neutral patterns of evolution.
   The clinal patterns at InR are replicated between North America and
   Australia, showing striking similarity in the distribution of specific
   alleles and the rate at which allele frequencies change across latitude.
   Moreover, we identified a polymorphism at InR that appears to be
   functionally significant and consistent with hypothetical patterns of
   selection across geography. This polymorphism provides new
   characterization of genic regions of functionality within InR, and is
   likely a component in a suite of genes and traits that respond
   adaptively to climatic variation.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{775-784}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Body size often shows adaptive clines in many ectotherms across altitude
   and latitude, but little is known about the genetic basis of these
   adaptive clines. Here we identify a polymorphism in the Dca (Drosophila
   cold acclimation) gene in Drosophila melanogaster that influences wing
   size, affects wing: thorax allometry and also controls a substantial
   proportion of the clinal wing-size variation. A polymorphism in the
   promoter region of Dca had two common alleles showing strong reciprocal
   clinal variation in frequency with latitude along the east coast of
   Australia. The Dca-237 allele increased towards the tropics where wing
   size is smaller. A within-population association study highlighted that
   an increase in the frequency of this allele decreased wing size but did
   not influence thorax size. A manipulated increase in the level of
   expression of Dca achieved through UAS-GAL4 was associated with a
   decrease in wing size but had no effect on thorax size. This was
   consistent with higher Dca expression levels in family lines with higher
   frequency of the Dca-237 allele. Genetic variation in the promoter
   region of the Dca gene appears to influence adaptive size variation in
   the eastern Australian cline of Drosophila melanogaster and accounts for
   more than 10\% of the genetic variation in size within and between
   populations.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{High-latitude diversification is a process characterized by speciation
   and extinction due to climatically driven vicariance and dispersal
   events. McKay's buntings (Plectrophenax hyperboreus) are high-latitude
   island endemic songbirds, and their global range is restricted to
   Beringia. Snow buntings (P. nivalis), their closest relatives, are
   distributed throughout the Holarctic, breeding in available habitat
   surrounding the island range of McKay's buntings. We sequenced 1123 base
   pairs of mitochondrial DNA for 40 individuals of each species and
   analysed a total of 913 AFLPs for 57 individuals. Both marker types
   suggested weak but significant genetic differentiation. Analysis of
   sequence data indicated divergence occurring when the current breeding
   range of McKay's buntings was a hill on the Beringian steppe (similar to
   18 400 to similar to 73 700 years before present), suggesting that snow
   buntings were restricted to lower latitudes by ice sheets. Ancestral
   effective population size estimates indicate a founder event in McKay's
   buntings followed by an expansion and then a reduction in effective
   size. Rising sea levels and asymmetric hybridization from McKay's
   buntings into the postglacially-colonizing population of snow buntings
   could account for this reduction. Reproductive isolation is likely
   maintained through differential arrival dates on breeding grounds and
   the high breeding density of McKay's buntings. This recent,
   high-latitude divergence best fits a model of founder event speciation
   driven by vicariance and oscillations in habitat due to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{New genomic resources and genetic tools of the past few years have
   advanced the nematode genus Caenorhabditis as a model for comparative
   biology. However, understanding of natural genetic variation at
   molecular and phenotypic levels remains rudimentary for most species in
   this genus, and for C. briggsae in particular. Here we characterize
   phenotypic variation in C. briggsae's sensitivity to the potentially
   important and variable environmental toxin, ethanol, for globally
   diverse strains. We also quantify nucleotide variation in a new sample
   of 32 strains from four continents, including small islands, and for the
   closest-known relative of this species (C. sp. 9). We demonstrate that
   C. briggsae exhibits little heritable variation for the effects of
   ethanol on the norm of reaction for survival and reproduction. Moreover,
   C. briggsae does not differ significantly from C. elegans in our assays
   of its response to this substance that both species likely encounter
   regularly in habitats of rotting fruit and vegetation. However, we
   uncover drastically more molecular genetic variation than was known
   previously for this species, despite most strains, including all island
   strains, conforming to the broad biogeographic patterns described
   previously. Using patterns of sequence divergence between populations
   and between species, we estimate that the self-fertilizing mode of
   reproduction by hermaphrodites in C. briggsae likely evolved sometime
   between 0.9 and 10 million generations ago. These insights into C.
   briggsae's natural history and natural genetic variation greatly expand
   the potential of this organism as an emerging model for studies in
   molecular and quantitative genetics, the evolution of development, and
   ecological genetics.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of sociality remains a challenge in evolutionary biology
   and a central question is whether association between kin is a critical
   factor favouring the evolution of cooperation. This study examines
   genetic structure of Anelosimus studiosus, a spider exhibiting
   polymorphic social behaviour. Two phenotypes have been identified: an
   `asocial' phenotype with solitary female nests and a `social' phenotype
   with multi-female/communal nests. To address the questions of whether
   these phenotypes are differentiated populations and whether cooperative
   individuals are closely related, we used microsatellites to analyse
   individuals from both communal and solitary nests. We found no evidence
   of differentiation between social and solitary samples, implying high
   rates of interbreeding. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
   these phenotypes coexist as a behavioural polymorphism within
   populations. Pairwise relatedness coefficients were used to test whether
   cooperating individuals are more closely related than expected by
   chance. Pairwise relatedness of females sharing communal webs averaged
   0.25, the level expected for half-siblings and significantly more
   closely related than random pairs from the population. Solitary females
   collected at similar distances to the communal spider pairs were also
   more closely related than expected by chance ( mean relatedness = 0.18),
   but less related than social pairs. These results imply that low
   dispersal contributes to increase likelihood of interaction between kin,
   but relatedness between social pairs is not explained by spatial
   structure alone. We propose that these phenotypes represent stages in
   the evolution of sociality, where viscous population structure creates
   opportunities for kin selection and cooperation is favoured under
   certain environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal ability is a key determinant of the propensity of an organism
   to cope with habitat fragmentation and climate change. Here we quantify
   queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape.
   Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring
   and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across
   a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of
   workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship
   reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including
   or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate
   reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal.
   Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used
   to take into account an expected low level of false identification of
   sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal.
   Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can
   disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are
   consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring
   in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow
   over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be
   sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large
   spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly
   disperse over distances greater than 10 km. Our results have clear
   implications for conservation strategies for this important pollinator
   group, particularly when attempting to conserve fragmented populations.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{832-843}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) have been related
   to individual variation in novelty-seeking or exploratory behaviour in a
   variety of animals, including humans. Recently, the human DRD4
   orthologue was sequenced in a wild bird, the great tit (Parus major) and
   a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene (SNP830) was
   shown to be associated with variation in exploratory behaviour of
   lab-raised individuals originating from a single wild population. Here
   we test the generality of this finding in a large sample of free-living
   individuals from four European great tit populations, including the
   originally sampled population. We demonstrate that the association
   between SNP830 genotype and exploratory behaviour also exists in
   free-living birds from the original population. However, in the other
   three populations we found only limited evidence for an association: in
   two populations the association appeared absent; while in one there was
   a nonsignificant tendency. We could not confirm a previously
   demonstrated interaction with another DRD4 polymorphism, a 15 bp indel
   in the promoter region (ID15). As yet unknown differences in genetic or
   environmental background could explain why the same genetic polymorphism
   (SNP830) has a substantial effect on exploratory behaviour in one
   population, explaining 4.5-5.8\% of the total variance-a large effect
   for a single gene influencing a complex behavioural trait-but not in
   three others. The confirmation of an association between SNP830 genotype
   and personality-related behaviour in a wild bird population warrants
   further research into potential fitness effects of the polymorphism,
   while also the population differences in the strength of the association
   deserve further investigation. Another important future challenge is the
   identification of additional loci influencing avian personality traits
   in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of energy flow in ecosystems is one of the primary
   goals of ecology, and the analysis of trophic interactions and food web
   dynamics is key to quantifying energy flow. Predator-prey interactions
   define the majority of trophic interactions and food web dynamics, and
   visual analysis of stomach, gut or fecal content composition is the
   technique traditionally used to quantify predator-prey interactions.
   Unfortunately such techniques may be biased and inaccurate due to
   variation in digestion rates (Sheppard \& Hardwood 2005); however, those
   limitations can be largely overcome with new technology. In the last 20
   years, the use of molecular genetic techniques in ecology has exploded
   (King et al. 2008). The growing availability of molecular genetic
   methods and data has fostered the use of PCR-based techniques to
   accurately distinguish and identify prey items in stomach, gut and fecal
   samples. In this month's issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Corse et
   al. (2010) describe and apply a new approach to quantifying
   predator-prey relationships using an ecosystem-level genetic
   characterization of available and consumed prey in European freshwater
   habitats (Fig. 1a). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hardy et al.
   (2010) marry the molecular genetic analysis of prey with a stable
   isotope (SI) analysis of trophic interactions in an Australian reservoir
   community (Fig. 1b). Both papers demonstrate novel and innovative
   approaches to an old problem - how do we effectively explore food webs
   and energy movement in ecosystems?.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between legumes and rhizobia has been well studied in
   the context of a mutualistic, nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. The fitness of
   legumes, including important agricultural crops, is enhanced by the
   plants' ability to develop symbiotic associations with certain soil
   bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen into a utilizable form, namely,
   ammonia, via a chemical reaction that only bacteria and archaea can
   perform. Of the bacteria, members of the alpha subclass of the
   protebacteria are the best-known nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes.
   Recently, members of the beta subclass of the proteobacteria that induce
   nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots in a species-specific manner
   have been identified. In this issue, Bontemps et al. reveal that not
   only are these newly identified rhizobia novel in shifting the paradigm
   of our understanding of legume symbiosis, but also, based on symbiotic
   gene phylogenies, have a history that is both ancient and stable.
   Expanding our understanding of novel plant growth promoting rhizobia
   will be a valuable resource for incorporating alternative strategies of
   nitrogen fixation for enhancing plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA mutations create variation in the efficiency of the
   oxidative phosphorylation pathway and therefore cellular energy
   production. Mildly deleterious mutations may reduce the performance of
   sperm cells in particular, due to their high energy requirements and low
   number of mitochondria, yet have little or no effect on the viability of
   somatic cells or ova. Mutations will be maintained in the population,
   despite the fitness cost for males, because mtDNA is passed down the
   female line. We looked for this so-called mother's curse effect in our
   captive colony of European brown hares. Significantly reduced male
   reproductive success was detected for a divergent haplotype that could
   be traced back to hares imported from a remote population. Median
   reproductive success for these hares was 0.17 compared to 0.49 for the
   indigenous haplotypes (Wilcoxon rank-sum, P = 0.002). No difference was
   detected for female reproductive success, nor were we able to find a
   nuclear DNA component to variation in male fertility. Our data are
   strong evidence for a mother's curse effect persisting despite multiple
   crossings over seven generations. These data raise important issues
   relating to the reproductive fitness of small or intermixing populations
   and have particular implications for the management of populations for
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Burkholderia has only recently been recognized as a potential
   nitrogen-fixing symbiont of legumes, but we find that the origins of
   symbiosis in Burkholderia are much deeper than previously suspected. We
   sampled 143 symbionts from 47 native species of Mimosa across 1800 km in
   central Brazil and found that 98\% were Burkholderia. Gene sequences
   defined seven distinct and divergent species complexes within the genus
   Burkholderia. The symbiosis-related genes formed deep
   Burkholderia-specific clades, each specific to a species complex,
   implying that these genes diverged over a long period within
   Burkholderia without substantial horizontal gene transfer between
   species complexes.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss has led to fragmentation of populations of many
   invertebrates, but social hymenopterans may be particularly sensitive to
   habitat fragmentation due to their low effective population sizes. The
   impacts of fragmentation depend strongly on dispersal abilities, but
   these are difficult to quantify. Here, we quantify and compare dispersal
   abilities of two bumblebee species, Bombus muscorum and Bombus jonellus,
   in a model island system. We use microsatellites to investigate
   population genetic structuring, dispersal and spatial patterns in
   genetic diversity. Populations of both species showed significant
   structuring, and isolation by distance, but this was markedly greater in
   B. muscorum (theta = 0.13) than in B. jonellus (theta = 0.034). This
   difference could reflect a higher effective population size in B.
   jonellus compared to B. muscorum, but this is not consistent with the
   observed abundance of the two species. We argue that it is more likely
   that B. jonellus has a higher propensity to disperse than B. muscorum.
   This will influence their relative susceptibility to habitat
   fragmentation and may in part explain differential declines of mainland
   populations of these and other bumblebee species.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-78}},

Abstract = {{Multiple geographical regions have been proposed for the domestication
   of Equus caballus. It has been suggested, based on zooarchaeological and
   genetic analyses that wild horses from the Iberian Peninsula were
   involved in the process, and the overrepresentation of mitochondrial D1
   cluster in modern Iberian horses supports this suggestion. To test this
   hypothesis, we analysed mitochondrial DNA from 22 ancient Iberian horse
   remains belonging to the Neolithic, the Bronze Age and the Middle Ages,
   against previously published sequences. Only the medieval Iberian
   sequence appeared in the D1 group. Neolithic and Bronze Age sequences
   grouped in other clusters, one of which (Lusitano group C) is
   exclusively represented by modern horses of Iberian origin. Moreover,
   Bronze Age Iberian sequences displayed the lowest nucleotide diversity
   values when compared with modern horses, ancient wild horses and other
   ancient domesticates using nonparametric bootstrapping analyses. We
   conclude that the excessive clustering of Bronze Age horses in the
   Lusitano group C, the observed nucleotide diversity and the local
   continuity from wild Neolithic Iberian to modern Iberian horses, could
   be explained by the use of local wild mares during an early Iberian
   domestication or restocking event, whereas the D1 group probably was
   introduced into Iberia in later historical times.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural and wild ecosystems may interact through shared pathogens
   such as Macrophomina phaseolina, a generalist clonal fungus with more
   than 284 plant hosts that is likely to become more important under
   climate change scenarios of increased heat and drought stress. To
   evaluate the degree of subdivision in populations of M. phaseolina in
   Kansas agriculture and wildlands, we compared 143 isolates from maize
   fields adjacent to tallgrass prairie, nearby sorghum fields, widely
   dispersed soybean fields and isolates from eight plant species in
   tallgrass prairie. Isolate growth phenotypes were evaluated on a medium
   containing chlorate. Genetic characteristics were analysed based on
   amplified fragment length polymorphisms and the sequence of the
   rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The average genetic
   similarity was 58\% among isolates in the tallgrass prairie, 71\% in the
   maize fields, 75\% in the sorghum fields and 80\% in the dispersed
   soybean fields. The isolates were divided into four clusters: one
   containing most of the isolates from maize and soybean, two others
   containing isolates from wild plants and sorghum, and a fourth
   containing a single isolate recovered from Solidago canadensis in the
   tallgrass prairie. Most of the sorghum isolates had the dense phenotype
   on media containing chlorate, while those from other hosts had either
   feathery or restricted phenotypes. These results suggest that the
   tallgrass prairie supports a more diverse population of M. phaseolina
   per area than do any of the crop species. Subpopulations show incomplete
   specialization by host. These results also suggest that inoculum
   produced in agriculture may influence tallgrass prairie communities, and
   conversely that different pathogen subpopulations in tallgrass prairie
   can interact there to generate `hybrids' with novel genetic profiles and
   pathogenic capabilities.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-107}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Co-existence of both mating types A1 and A2 within the EU1 lineage of
   Phytophthora ramorum has only been observed in Belgium, which begs the
   question whether sexual reproduction is occurring. A collection of 411
   Belgian P. ramorum isolates was established during a 7-year survey. Our
   main objectives were genetic characterization of this population to test
   for sexual reproduction, determination of population structure,
   evolution and spread, and evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of
   control measures. Novel, polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR)
   markers were developed after screening 149 candidate loci. Eighty
   isolates of P. ramorum, broadly representing the Belgian population,
   were analyzed using four previously described and three newly identified
   polymorphic microsatellite loci as well as amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms. SSR analysis was most informative and was used to screen
   the entire Belgian population. Thirty multilocus genotypes were
   identified, but 68\% of the isolates belonged to the main genotype
   EU1MG1. Although accumulated mutation events were detected, the overall
   level of genetic diversity within the Belgian isolates of P. ramorum
   appears to be limited, indicating a relatively recent clonal expansion.
   Based on our SSR analysis there is no evidence of sexual recombination
   in the Belgian population of P. ramorum. Metalaxyl use decreased the
   genetic diversity of P. ramorum until 2005, when the majority of the
   isolates had become resistant. Most genotypes were site-specific and
   despite systematic removal of symptomatic and neighbouring plants, some
   genotypes were detected over a period of several years at a single site,
   sometimes discontinuously, indicating (latent) survival of the pathogen
   at those sites.}},

Abstract = {{Direct estimation of dispersal rates at large geographic scales can be
   technically and logistically challenging, especially in small animals of
   low vagility like amphibians. The use of molecular markers to reveal
   patterns of genetic structure provides an indirect way to infer
   dispersal rates and patterns of recent and historical gene flow among
   populations. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data and
   genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to examine
   population structure in the Pyrenean brook newt (Calotriton asper)
   across four main drainages in the French Pyrenees. mtDNA sequence data
   (2040 bp) revealed three phylogroups shallowly differentiated and with
   low genetic diversity. In sharp contrast, variation in 382 amplified
   fragment length polymorphism loci was high and revealed a clear pattern
   of isolation by distance consistent with long-term restriction of gene
   flow at three spatial scales: (i) among all four main drainages, (ii)
   between sites within drainages, and (iii) even between adjacent
   populations separated by less than 4 km. The high pairwise F-ST values
   between localities across numerous loci, together with the high
   frequency of fixed alleles in several populations, suggests a
   combination of marked geographic isolation, small population sizes and
   very limited dispersal in C. asper. The contrasting lack of variation
   detected in mtDNA sequence data is intriguing and underscores the
   importance of multilocus approaches to detect true patterns of gene flow
   in natural populations of amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of sex and recombination, key factors in the
   evolution of life, is a major challenge in biology. Studies of
   reproduction strategies of natural populations are important to
   complement the theoretical and experimental models. Fungi with both
   sexual and asexual life cycles are an interesting system for
   understanding the evolution of sex. In a study of natural populations of
   yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that the isolates are
   heterothallic, meaning their mating type is stable, while the general
   belief is that natural S. cerevisiae strains are homothallic (can
   undergo mating-type switching). Mating-type switching is a
   gene-conversion process initiated by a site-specific endonuclease HO;
   this process can be followed by mother-daughter mating. Heterothallic
   yeast can mate with unrelated haploids (amphimixis), or undergo mating
   between spores from the same tetrad (intratetrad mating, or automixis),
   but cannot undergo mother-daughter mating as homothallic yeasts can.
   Sequence analysis of HO gene in a panel of natural S. cerevisiae
   isolates revealed multiple mutations. Good correspondence was found in
   the comparison of population structure characterized using 19
   microsatellite markers spread over eight chromosomes and the HO
   sequence. Experiments that tested whether the mating-type switching
   pathway upstream and downstream of HO is functional, together with the
   detected HO mutations, strongly suggest that loss of function of HO is
   the cause of heterothallism. Furthermore, our results support the
   hypothesis that clonal reproduction and intratetrad mating may
   predominate in natural yeast populations, while mother-daughter mating
   might not be as significant as was considered.}},

Abstract = {{As the evolutionary significance of hybridization is largely dictated by
   its extent beyond the first generation, we broadly surveyed patterns of
   introgression across a sympatric zone of two native poplars (Populus
   balsamifera, Populus deltoides) in Quebec, Canada within which European
   exotic Populus nigra and its hybrids have been extensively planted since
   the 1800s. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared fixed
   within each species were characterized by DNA-sequencing pools of pure
   individuals. Thirty-five of these diagnostic SNPs were employed in a
   high-throughput assay that genotyped 635 trees of different age classes,
   sampled from 15 sites with various degrees of anthropogenic disturbance.
   The degree of admixture within sampled trees was then assessed through
   Bayesian clustering of genotypes. Hybrids were present in seven of the
   populations, with 2.4\% of all sampled trees showing spontaneous
   admixture. Sites with hybrids were significantly more disturbed than
   pure stands, while hybrids comprised both immature juveniles and trees
   of reproductive age. All three possible F1s were detected.
   Advanced-generation hybrids were consistently biased towards P.
   balsamifera regardless of whether hybridization had occurred with P.
   deltoides or P. nigra. Gene exchange between P. deltoides and P. nigra
   was not detected beyond the F1 generation; however, detection of a
   trihybrid demonstrates that even this apparent reproductive isolation
   does not necessarily result in an evolutionary dead end. Collectively,
   results demonstrate the natural fertility of hybrid poplars and suggest
   that introduced genes could potentially affect the genetic integrity of
   native trees, similar to that arising from introgression between
   natives.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 20 000 years ago the last glacial maximum (LGM) radically
   altered the distributions of many Northern Hemisphere terrestrial
   organisms. Fewer studies describing the biogeographic responses of
   marine species to the LGM have been conducted, but existing genetic data
   from coastal marine species indicate that fewer taxa show clear
   signatures of post-LGM recolonization. We have assembled a mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) data set for 14 co-distributed northeastern Pacific
   rocky-shore species from four phyla by combining new sequences from ten
   species with previously published sequences from eight species. Nuclear
   sequences from four species were retrieved from GenBank, plus we
   gathered new elongation factor 1-alpha sequences from the barnacle
   Balanus glandula. Results from demographic analyses of mtDNA for five
   (36\%) species (Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, Littorina
   sitkana, L. scutulata, Xiphister mucosus) were consistent with large
   population expansions occurring near the LGM, a pattern expected if
   these species recently recolonized the region. However, seven (50\%)
   species (Mytilus trossulus, M. californianus, B. glandula, S. cariosus,
   Patiria miniata, Katharina tunicata, X. atropurpureus) exhibited
   histories consistent with long-term stability in effective population
   size, a pattern indicative of regional persistence during the LGM. Two
   species of Nucella with significant mtDNA genetic structure showed
   spatially variable demographic histories. Multilocus analyses for five
   species were largely consistent with mtDNA: the majority of multilocus
   interpopulation divergence times significantly exceeded the LGM. Our
   results indicate that the LGM did not extirpate the majority of species
   in the northeastern Pacific; instead, regional persistence during the
   LGM appears a common biogeographic history for rocky-shore organisms in
   this region.}},

Abstract = {{Major environmental events that fragment populations among multiple
   island habitats have potential to drive large-scale episodes of
   speciation and adaptive radiation. A recent palaeolimnological study of
   sediment cores indicated that Lake Malawi underwent major climate-driven
   desiccation events 75 000-135 000 years ago that lowered the water level
   to at least 580 m below the present state and severely reduced surface
   area. After this period, lake levels rose and stabilized, creating
   multiple discontinuous littoral rocky habitats. Here, we present
   evidence supporting the hypothesis that establishment and expansion of
   isolated philopatric rock cichlid populations occurred after this rise
   and stabilization of lake level. We studied the Pseudotropheus
   (Maylandia) species complex, a group with both allopatric and sympatric
   populations that differ in male nuptial colour traits and tend to mate
   assortatively. Using coalescent analyses based on mitochondrial DNA, we
   found evidence that populations throughout the lake started to expand
   and accumulate genetic diversity after the lake level rise. Moreover,
   most haplotypes were geographically restricted, and the greatest genetic
   similarities were typically among sympatric or neighbouring populations.
   This is indicative of limited dispersal and establishment of assortative
   mating among populations following the lake level rise. Together, this
   evidence is compatible with a single large-scale environmental event
   being central to evolution of spatial patterns of genetic and species
   diversity in P. (Maylandia) and perhaps other Lake Malawi rock cichlids.
   Equivalent climate-driven pulses of habitat formation and fragmentation
   may similarly have contributed to observed rapid and punctuated
   cladogenesis in other adaptive radiations.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a Global Biodiversity Hotspot, the conservation of Sri
   Lanka's endemic biodiversity warrants special attention. With 51 species
   (50 of them endemic) occurring in the island, the biodiversity of
   freshwater crabs is unusually high for such a small area (65 600 km2).
   Freshwater crabs have successfully colonized most moist habitats and all
   climatic and elevational zones in Sri Lanka. We assessed the
   biodiversity of these crabs in relation to the different elevational
   zones (lowland, upland and highland) based on both species richness and
   phylogenetic diversity. Three different lineages appear to have radiated
   simultaneously, each within a specific elevational zone, with little
   interchange thereafter. The lowland and upland zones show a higher
   species richness than the highland zone while - unexpectedly -
   phylogenetic diversity is highest in the lowland zone, illustrating the
   importance of considering both these measures in conservation planning.
   The diversity indices for the species in the various IUCN Red List
   categories in each of the three zones suggest that risk of extinction
   may be related to elevational zone. Our results also show that overall
   more than 50\% of Sri Lanka's freshwater crab species (including several
   as yet undescribed ones), or approximately 72 million years of
   evolutionary history, are threatened with extinction.}},

   food webs in a weir pool on the lower Murray River, a highly impacted,
   complex and regulated ecosystem in southern Australia. We demonstrate
   that small fish in the Murray River consume a wide range of food items,
   but that a significant component of carbon and nitrogen entering the
   food web during dry periods in summer, but not spring, is derived from
   nonconventional sources other than in-channel primary producers. This
   study also showed that isotopic analyses alone cannot distinguish food
   sources and that a combined approach is better able to elucidate
   food-consumer dynamics. Our results highlight that a major river
   ecosystem, stressed by reduced environmental flows, can rapidly undergo
   significant and previously undetected changes that impact on the ecology
   of the system as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{Most plant species are recent or ancient polyploids (displaying at least
   one round of genome duplication in their history). Cultivated species
   (e.g. wheat, cotton, canola, sugarcane, coffee) and invasive species are
   often relatively recent polyploids, and frequently of hybrid origin
   (i.e. allopolyploids). Despite the genetic bottleneck occurring during
   the allopolyploid speciation process, the formation of such species from
   two divergent lineages leads to fixed heterozygosity decisive to their
   success. New phenotypes and new niche occupation are usually associated
   with this mode of speciation, as a result of both genomic rearrangements
   and gene expression changes of different magnitudes depending on the
   different polyploid species investigated. These gene expression changes
   affecting newly formed polyploid species may result from various,
   interconnected mechanisms, including (i) functional interactions between
   the homoeologous copies and between their products, that are reunited in
   the same nucleus and cell; (ii) the fate of duplicated copies, selective
   pressure on one of the parental copy being released which could lead to
   gene loss, pseudogenization, or alternatively, to subfunctionalization
   or neofunctionalization; and (iii) epigenetic landscape changes that in
   turn affect gene expression. As one of the interrelated processes
   leading to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the DNA methylation
   status of newly formed species appears to be consistently affected
   following both hybridization and genome doubling. In this issue,
   Verhoeven et al. have investigated the fate of DNA methylation patterns
   that could affect naturally occurring new asexual triploid lineages of
   dandelions. As a result of such a ploidy level change, the authors
   demonstrate stably transmitted DNA methylation changes leading to unique
   DNA methylation patterns in each newly formed lineage. Most studies
   published to date on plant DNA methylation polymorphism were performed
   using restriction enzymes sensitive to methylation. Recently, new
   high-throughput methods were made available, thanks to the development
   of `next-generation sequencing' techniques. The combination of these
   methods offers powerful and promising tools to investigate epigenetic
   variation in both model and non-model systems.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Local populations within a species can become isolated by stochastic or
   adaptive processes, though it is most commonly the former that we
   quantify. Using presumably neutral markers we can assess the
   time-dependent process of genetic drift, and thereby quantify patterns
   of differentiation in support of the effective management of diversity.
   However, adaptive differences can be overlooked in these studies, and
   these are the very characteristics that we hope to conserve by managing
   neutral diversity. In this study, we used 16 hypothetically neutral
   microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic structure of the
   roundnose grenadier in the North Atlantic. We found that one locus was a
   clear outlier under directional selection, with F-ST values much greater
   than at the remaining loci. Differentiation between populations at this
   locus was related to depth, suggesting directional selection, presumably
   acting on a linked locus. Considering only the loci identified as
   neutral, there remained significant population structure over the region
   of the North Atlantic studied. In addition to a weak pattern of
   isolation by distance, we identified a putative barrier to gene flow
   between sample sites either side of the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone,
   which marks the location where the sub-polar front crosses the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This may reflect a boundary across which larvae are
   differentially distributed in separate current systems to some extent,
   promoting differentiation by drift. Structure due to both drift and
   apparent selection should be considered in management policy.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-240}},

Abstract = {{Reintroductions and translocations are increasingly used to repatriate
   or increase probabilities of persistence for animal and plant species.
   Genetic and demographic characteristics of founding individuals and
   suitability of habitat at release sites are commonly believed to affect
   the success of these conservation programs. Genetic divergence among
   multiple source populations of American martens (Martes americana) and
   well documented introduction histories permitted analyses of
   post-introduction dispersion from release sites and development of
   genetic clusters in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan < 50 years
   following release. Location and size of spatial genetic clusters and
   measures of individual-based autocorrelation were inferred using 11
   microsatellite loci. We identified three genetic clusters in geographic
   proximity to original release locations. Estimated distances of
   effective gene flow based on spatial autocorrelation varied greatly
   among genetic clusters (30-90 km). Spatial contiguity of genetic
   clusters has been largely maintained with evidence for admixture
   primarily in localized regions, suggesting recent contact or locally
   retarded rates of gene flow. Data provide guidance for future studies of
   the effects of permeabilities of different land-cover and land-use
   features to dispersal and of other biotic and environmental factors that
   may contribute to the colonization process and development of spatial
   genetic associations.}},

Title = {{Low genetic diversity in a snail intermediate host (Biomphalaria

   River Basin}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Population genetic perturbations of intermediate hosts, often a
   consequence of human pressure on environmental resources, can
   precipitate unexpectedly severe disease outbreaks. Such disturbances are
   set to become increasingly common following range changes concomitant
   with climate shifts, dwindling natural resources and major
   infrastructure changes such as hydroprojects. Construction of the Diama
   dam in the Senegal River Basin (SRB) reduced river salinity, enabling
   the freshwater snail intermediate host Biomphalaria pfeifferi to rapidly
   expand its distribution. A serious public health problem ensued, with an
   epidemic of intestinal schistosomiasis occurring in the previously
   schistosome-free Richard-Toll region within 2 years. The current study
   aimed to assess the population variability of B. pfeifferi in the SRB,
   and speculate upon its subsequent impact on host-parasite interactions
   following such engineered ecological change. Genetic variation at nine
   polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed little population
   differentiation in SRB snails compared with those from natural habitats
   in Zimbabwe, where Schistosoma mansoni transmission is much lower.
   `Open' SRB habitats are associated with greater water contact, smaller
   population sizes and less genetic diversity, with sites downstream of
   Richard-Toll showing greater inter- and intrapopulation variation,
   concomitant with less frequent human contact. These observations may be
   explained by rapid expansion into pristine habitat selecting for high
   fecundity genotypes at the expense of schistosome resistance, presenting
   S. mansoni with genetically homogenous highly fecund susceptible
   populations around the focal point, promoting development of a highly
   compatible host-parasite relationship. Longitudinal study of such
   systems may prove important in predicting public health risks engendered
   by future environmental engineering projects.}},

Abstract = {{Swordtails (Xiphophorus; Poeciliidae) have figured prominently in
   research on fish mating behaviours, sexual selection, and
   carcinogenesis, but their population structures and dispersal patterns
   have been relatively neglected. Using nine microsatellite loci, we
   estimated genetic differentiation in Xiphophorus helleri within and
   between adjacent streams in Belize. The genetic data were complemented
   by a tagging study of movement within one stream. In the absence of
   physical dispersal barriers (waterfalls), population structure followed
   an isolation by distance (IBD) pattern. Genetic differentiation (F(ST)
   up to 0.07) was significant between and within creeks, despite high
   dispersal in the latter as judged by the tagging data. Such
   heterogeneity apparently was a result of genetic drift in local demes,
   due to small population sizes and highly skewed paternity. The IBD
   pattern was interrupted by waterfalls, boosting F(ST) above 0.30 between
   adjacent samples across these barriers. Overall, our results are helpful
   in understanding the interplay of evolutionary forces and population
   dynamics in a small fish living in a changeable habitat.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Aspergillus flavus, a fungal pathogen of animals and both wild and
   economically important plants, is most recognized for producing
   aflatoxin, a cancer-causing secondary metabolite that contaminates food
   and animal feed globally. Aspergillus flavus has two self/nonself
   recognition systems, a sexual compatibility system and a vegetative
   incompatibility system, and both play a role in directing gene flow in
   populations. Aspergillus flavus reproduces clonally in wild and
   agricultural settings, but whether a cryptic sexual stage exists in
   nature is currently unknown. We investigated the distribution of genetic
   variation in 243 samples collected over 4 years from three common
   vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) in Arizona and Texas from cotton
   using 24 microsatellite loci and the mating type locus (MAT) to assess
   population structure and potential gene flow among A. flavus VCGs in
   sympatric populations. All isolates within a VCG had the same mating
   type with OD02 having MAT1-2 and both CG136 and MR17 having MAT1-1. Our
   results support the hypothesis that these three A. flavus VCGs are
   genetically isolated. We found high levels of genetic differentiation
   and no evidence of gene flow between VCGs, including VCGs of opposite
   mating-type. Our results suggest that these VCGs diverged before
   domestication of agricultural hosts (> 10 000 yr bp).}},

Abstract = {{Severe declines in megafauna worldwide illuminate the role of top
   predators in ecosystem structure. In the Antarctic, the Krill Surplus
   Hypothesis posits that the killing of more than 2 million large whales
   led to competitive release for smaller krill-eating species like the
   Antarctic minke whale. If true, the current size of the Antarctic minke
   whale population may be unusually high as an indirect result of whaling.
   Here, we estimate the long-term population size of the Antarctic minke
   whale prior to whaling by sequencing 11 nuclear genetic markers from 52
   modern samples purchased in Japanese meat markets. We use coalescent
   simulations to explore the potential influence of population
   substructure and find that even though our samples are drawn from a
   limited geographic area, our estimate reflects ocean-wide genetic
   diversity. Using Bayesian estimates of the mutation rate and
   coalescent-based analyses of genetic diversity across loci, we calculate
   the long-term population size of the Antarctic minke whale to be 670 000
   individuals (95\% confidence interval: 374 000-1 150 000). Our estimate
   of long-term abundance is similar to, or greater than, contemporary
   abundance estimates, suggesting that managing Antarctic ecosystems under
   the assumption that Antarctic minke whales are unusually abundant is not
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous genes in diverse organisms have been shown to be under positive
   selection, especially genes involved in reproduction, adaptation to
   contrasting environments, hybrid inviability, and host-pathogen
   interactions. Looking for genes under positive selection in pathogens
   has been a priority in efforts to investigate coevolution dynamics and
   to develop vaccines or drugs. To elucidate the functions involved in
   host specialization, here we aimed at identifying candidate sequences
   that could have evolved under positive selection among closely related
   pathogens specialized on different hosts. For this goal, we sequenced c.
   17 000-32 000 ESTs from each of four Microbotryum species, which are
   fungal pathogens responsible for anther smut disease on host plants in
   the Caryophyllaceae. Forty-two of the 372 predicted orthologous genes
   showed significant signal of positive selection, which represents a good
   number of candidate genes for further investigation. Sequencing 16 of
   these genes in 9 additional Microbotryum species confirmed that they
   have indeed been rapidly evolving in the pathogen species specialized on
   different hosts. The genes showing significant signals of positive
   selection were putatively involved in nutrient uptake from the host,
   secondary metabolite synthesis and secretion, respiration under
   stressful conditions and stress response, hyphal growth and
   differentiation, and regulation of expression by other genes. Many of
   these genes had transmembrane domains and may therefore also be involved
   in pathogen recognition by the host. Our approach thus revealed fruitful
   and should be feasible for many non-model organisms for which candidate
   genes for diversifying selection are needed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a novel approach that may shed light on the
   genomic DNA methylation of organisms with non-resolved genomes. The
   LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) is permissive for genomic DNA
   methylation studies of any genome as it relies on the use of
   methyl-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzymes followed by
   polymerase extension via Pyrosequencing technology. Here, LUMA was used
   to characterize genomic DNA methylation in the lower brain stem region
   from 47 polar bears subsistence hunted in central East Greenland between
   1999 and 2001. In these samples, average genomic DNA methylation was
   57.9\% +/- 6.69 (SD; range was 42.0 to 72.4\%). When genomic DNA
   methylation was related to brain mercury (Hg) exposure levels, an
   inverse association was seen between these two variables for the entire
   study population (P for trend = 0.17). After dichotomizing animals by
   gender and controlling for age, a negative trend was seen amongst male
   animals (P for trend = 0.07) but no associations were found in female
   bears. Such sexually dimorphic responses have been found in other
   toxicological studies. Our results show that genomic DNA methylation can
   be quantitatively studied in a highly reproducible manner in tissue
   samples from a wild organism with a non-resolved genome. As such, LUMA
   holds great promise as a novel method to explore consequential questions
   across the ecological sciences that may require an epigenetic
   understanding.}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that has the potential to
   affect plant phenotypes and that is responsive to environmental and
   genomic stresses such as hybridization and polyploidization. We explored
   de novo methylation variation that arises during the formation of
   triploid asexual dandelions from diploid sexual mother plants using
   methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP)
   analysis. In dandelions, triploid apomictic asexuals are produced from
   diploid sexual mothers that are fertilized by polyploid pollen donors.
   We asked whether the ploidy level change that accompanies the formation
   of new asexual lineages triggers methylation changes that contribute to
   heritable epigenetic variation within novel asexual lineages. Comparison
   of MS-AFLP and AFLP fragment inheritance in a diploid x triploid cross
   revealed de novo methylation variation between triploid F(1)
   individuals. Genetically identical offspring of asexual F(1) plants
   showed modest levels of methylation variation, comparable to background
   levels as observed among sibs in a long-established asexual lineage.
   Thus, the cross between ploidy levels triggered de novo methylation
   variation between asexual lineages, whereas it did not seem to
   contribute directly to variation within new asexual lineages. The
   observed background level of methylation variation suggests that
   considerable autonomous methylation variation could build up within
   asexual lineages under natural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of genes involved in local adaptation is particularly
   challenging for species functioning as a network of interconnected
   populations undergoing frequent extinctions-recolonizations, because
   populations are submitted to contrasted evolutionary pressures. Using
   amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, population genetic
   structure of the mosquito Aedes rusticus was analysed in five
   geographical areas of the French Rhone-Alpes region. We included a
   number of sites that were treated with the bio-insecticide Bacillus
   thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) for more than 15 years. Analysis of
   molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was
   found within populations (96\%), with no significant variation among
   geographical areas, although variation among populations within areas
   (4\%) was significant. The global genetic differentiation index F(ST)
   was low (0.0366 +/- 0.167). However, pairwise F(ST) values were
   significant and no isolation-by-distance at the regional level was
   observed, suggesting a metapopulation structure in this species.
   Bti-treatment had no effect on genetic structure and on
   within-population genetic diversity. Potential signatures of positive
   selection associated with Bti-treatment were detected for five loci,
   even though toxicological bioassays performed on field-collected larvae
   showed no significant difference in mortality between Bti-treated and
   nontreated sites. The difficulty of detecting moderate resistance in
   field-collected larvae together with possible differential persistence
   of toxins in the environment may explain our inability to detect a
   toxicological response to Bti in treated sites. The evidence for
   positive selection occurring at several genomic regions suggests a first
   step towards Bti resistance in natural mosquito populations treated with
   this bio-insecticide. Furthermore, this signal was detectable using
   genomic tools before any toxicological evidence for resistance could be
   identified.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic
   diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North
   America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity
   have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Pleistocene for the
   Qinghai-Tibetan (Tibetan) plateau, a region where glaciation was not
   synchronous with the North Hemisphere ice sheet maxima, remains poorly
   understood. Here, we compared the phylogeographical patterns of five
   avian species on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau by three mitochondrial DNA
   fragments: the Tibetan snow finch (Montifringilla adamsi), the
   Blanford's snow finch (Pyrgilauda blanfordi), the horned lark
   (Eremophila alpestris), the twite (Carduelis flavirostris) and the black
   redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). Our results revealed the three species
   mostly distributed on the platform region of the plateau that
   experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive
   glaciation period (0.5-0.175 Ma). These results are at odds with the
   results from avian species of Europe and North America, where population
   expansions occurred after Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 0.023-0.018 Ma). A
   single refugium was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area
   around the eastern margin of the plateau, instead of multiple
   independent refugia for European and North American species. For the
   other two species distributed on the edges of the plateau (the twite and
   black redstart), populations were maintained at stable levels. Edge
   areas are located on the eastern margin, which might have had little or
   no ice cover during the glaciation period. Thus, milder climate may have
   mitigated demographic stresses for edge species relative to the extremes
   experienced by platform counterparts, the present-day ranges of which
   were heavily ice covered during the glaciation period. Finally, various
   behavioural and ecological characteristics, including dispersal
   capacities, habitat preference and altitude specificity along with
   evolutionary history might have helped to shape different
   phylogeographical structures appearing in these five species.}},

Title = {{The east-west-north colonization history of the Mediterranean and Europe
   by the coastal plant Carex extensa (Cyperaceae)}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Coastal plants are ideal models for studying the colonization routes of
   species because of the simple linear distributions of these species.
   Carex extensa occurs mainly in salt marshes along the Mediterranean and
   European coasts. Variation in cpDNA sequences, amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) of 24
   populations were analysed to reconstruct its colonization history.
   Phylogenetic relationships indicate that C. extensa together with the
   South American Carex vixdentata and the southern African Carex ecklonii
   form a monophyletic group of halophilic species. Analyses of divergence
   times suggest that early lineage diversification may have occurred
   between the late Miocene and the late Pliocene (Messinian crisis).
   Phylogenetic and network analyses of cpDNA variation revealed the
   monophyly of the species and an ancestral haplotype contained in
   populations of the eastern Mediterranean. The AFLP and SSR analyses
   support a pattern of variation compatible with these two lineages. These
   analyses also show higher levels of genetic diversity and
   differentiation in the eastern population group, which underwent an
   east-to-west Mediterranean colonization. Quaternary climatic
   oscillations appear to have been responsible for the split between these
   two lineages. Secondary contacts may have taken place in areas near the
   Ligurian Sea in agreement with the gene flow detected in Corsican
   populations. The AFLP and SSR data accord with the `tabula rasa'
   hypothesis in which a recent and rapid colonization of northern Europe
   took place from the western Mediterranean after the Last Glacial
   Maximum. The unbalanced west-east vs. west-north colonization may be as
   a result of `high density blocking' effect.}},

Title = {{Out in the cold: genetic variation of Nothofagus pumilio (Nothofagaceae)
   provides evidence for latitudinally distinct evolutionary histories in
   austral South America}},

Abstract = {{Nothofagus pumilio is the dominant and almost ubiquitous tree species in
   mountainous environments of temperate South America. We used two types
   of molecular markers (cpDNA and isozymes) to evaluate the effects of the
   Paleogene paleogeography of Patagonia and more recent climatic
   oscillations of the Neogene on such cold-tolerant species' genetic
   makeup. Phylogeographic analysis on sequences of three cpDNA non-coding
   regions at 85 populations yielded two latitudinally disjunct
   monophyletic clades north and south of c. 42 degrees S containing 11 and
   three haplotypes, respectively. This indicates a long-lasting vicariant
   event due to the presence of an extended open paleobasin at mid
   latitudes of Patagonia. Also distribution patterns of cpDNA haplotypes
   suggest regional spread following stepping-stone models using
   pre-Cenozoic mountains as corridors. Comparable genetic diversity
   measured along 41 sampled populations using seven polymorphic isozyme
   loci provides evidence of local persistence and spread from multiple
   ice-free locations. In addition, significantly higher heterozygosity and
   allelic richness at high latitudes, i.e. in areas of larger glacial
   extent, suggest survival in large and isolated refugia. While, higher
   cpDNA diversity in lower latitudes reflects the complex orogeny that
   historically isolated northern populations, lower isozyme diversity and
   reduced F(ST) values provide evidence of local glacial survival in
   numerous small locales. Therefore, current genetic structure of N.
   pumilio is the result of regional processes which took place during the
   Tertiary that were enhanced by contemporary local effects of drift and
   isolation in response to Quaternary climatic cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The North-Western Mediterranean basin is well known for its high number
   of relictual endemic taxa, and has been indicated as one of the world's
   major biodiversity hotspots at the species level. A possible
   contributing factor may be long-term persistence of populations and
   their prolonged stability. This study was designed to investigate the
   phylogeographic structure of three common species of the genus
   Lepidocyrtus (Hexapoda: Collembola), soil-dwelling arthropods
   characterized by limited dispersal capabilities and generally associated
   with forest habitats. We observed a remarkable geographic structure,
   with numerous deeply divergent genetic lineages occupying islands as
   well as mainland sites with no apparent gene flow among most sites, even
   across distances of only tens of kilometres. The reconstructed time
   frame for the evolution of these lineages suggests divergence between 5
   and 15 Ma. This indicates a remarkably ancient origin and long-term
   persistence of individual lineages over a fine geographic scale despite
   the occurrence of abrupt sea level and climatic fluctuations in the
   area. This further suggests that currently recognized morphological
   species might be a serious underestimation of the true springtail
   biodiversity within this region.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{401-413}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In many taxa, females lay eggs in the nests of other conspecifics. To
   determine the conditions under which conspecific brood parasitism
   develops, it is necessary to identify parasitic offspring and the
   females who produce them; however, for most systems parasitism can be
   difficult to observe and most genetic approaches have relatively low
   resolving power. In this study, we used protein fingerprinting from egg
   albumen and 10 microsatellite loci to genetically match parasitic
   ducklings to their mothers in a population of ruddy ducks (Oxyura
   jamaicensis). We found that 67\% of nests contained parasitic offspring,
   and we successfully identified their mothers in 61\% of the cases. Of
   the parasitic females identified, 77\% also had nests of their own (i.e.
   a dual tactic, where females both nest and lay parasitically), and we
   found no evidence that parasitic females pursued a specialist
   (parasitism only) tactic. We also found that parasitic egg laying was
   not influenced by nest loss, predation or female condition. Thus, in
   contrast to most waterfowl studied to date, female ruddy ducks appear to
   lay parasitic eggs whenever the opportunity arises.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{414-425}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Interspecific mutualism can evolve when specific lineages of different
   species tend to be associated with each other from one generation to the
   next. Different maternally transmitted endosymbionts occurring within
   the same cytoplasmic lineage fulfil this requirement. Drosophila
   neotestacea is infected with maternally transmitted Wolbachia and
   Spiroplasma, which are cotransmitted at high frequency in natural
   populations. Molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both
   endosymbionts have been present in D. neotestacea for considerable
   evolutionary periods. Thus, conditions are suitable for the evolution of
   mutualism between them. In support of this possibility, there is a
   significant positive association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma
   infection in many samples of D. neotestacea from natural populations.
   Theoretically, such a positive association can result from either
   mutualism between these endosymbionts or recent spread. Collections from
   present-day populations suggest that recent spread and mutualism have
   both operated to generate the positive association between Wolbachia and
   Spiroplasma. If selection acts on the combination of these two
   endosymbionts, they may be in the early stages of evolution of a more
   complex, cooperative association.}},
