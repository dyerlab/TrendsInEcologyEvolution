Abstract = {{If island biogeography has a sweet spot, its where islands generate
   their own species diversity rather than merely taking on mainland
   immigrants. In birds and other highly dispersive taxa, however, this
   zone of radiation, may be vanishingly small. Darwins finches and
   Hawaiian Honeycreepers are among only a handful of examples of island
   radiation in birds (Price 2008), suggesting that winged powers of
   dispersal make sufficient isolation from mainland colonists unlikely,
   while also hindering speciation within and among isolated islands.
   Nevertheless, two studies in this issue of Molecular Ecology join a
   string of other recent analyses suggesting that island radiation in
   birds remains under-appreciated (see also Moyle 2009; Kisel \&
   Barraclough 2010; Rosindell \& Phillimore 2011). Melo (2011) use a
   phylogenetic analysis of white-eyes on islands in the Gulf of Guinea to
   identify two previously overlooked island radiations, and reveal
   replicated adaptive divergence on islands where species occur in pairs.
   Sly (2011), meanwhile, consider possible explanations for speciation and
   geographic differentiation within a large island, and find the same type
   of oceanic barriers that are critical to bird speciation across
   archipelagos may also contribute to divergence that appears to have
   occurred within a single island.}},

Abstract = {{The immune system has evolved, and continues to evolve, in response to
   the selection pressure that infections exert on animals in their natural
   environments, yet much of our understanding about how the immune system
   functions comes from studies of model species maintained in the almost
   complete absence of such environmental selection. The scientific
   discipline of immunology has among its aims the improvement of human and
   animal health by the application of immunological knowledge. As research
   on humans and domesticated animals is highly constrainedethically,
   logistically and financiallyexperimental animal models have become an
   invaluable tool for dissecting the functioning of the immune system. The
   house mouse (Mus musculus) is by far the most widely used animal model
   in immunological research but laboratory-reared mice provide a very
   narrow view of the immune systemthat of a well-fed and comfortably
   housed animal with minimal exposure to microbial pathogens. Indeed, so
   much of our immunological knowledge comes from studies of a very few
   highly inbred mouse strains thatto all intents and purposesour
   immunological knowledge is based on enormously detailed studies of very
   small numbers of individual mice. The limitations of studies in inbred
   strains of laboratory mice are well-recognized (Pedersen \& Babayan
   2011), but serious attempts to address these limitations have been few
   and far between. However, the emerging field of ecological immunology
   where free-living populations are studied in their natural habitat is
   beginning to redress this imbalance (Viney 2005; Martin 2006; Owen 2010;
   Abolins 2011). As demonstrated in the work by Boysen (2011) in this
   issue of Molecular Ecology, studies in wild animal populationsespecially
   free-living M.similar to musculusrepresent a valuable bridge between
   studies in humans and livestock and studies of captive animals.}},

Abstract = {{The comparison between quantitative genetic divergence (QST) and neutral
   genetic divergence (FST) among populations has become the standard test
   for historical signatures of selection on quantitative traits. However,
   when the mutation rate of neutral markers is relatively high in
   comparison with gene flow, estimates of FST will decrease, resulting in
   upwardly biased comparisons of QST vs. FST. Reviewing empirical studies,
   the difference between QST and FST is positively related to marker
   heterozygosity. After refuting alternative explanations for this
   pattern, we conclude that marker mutation rate indeed has had a biasing
   effect on published QSTFST comparisons. Hence, it is no longer clear
   that populations have commonly diverged in response to divergent
   selection. We present and discuss potential solutions to this bias.
   Comparing QST with recent indices of neutral divergence that
   statistically correct for marker heterozygosity (Hedricks G'st and Josts
   D) is not advised, because these indices are not theoretically
   equivalent to QST. One valid solution is to estimate FST from neutral
   markers with mutation rates comparable to those of the loci underlying
   quantitative traits (e.g. SNPs). QST can also be compared to FST (PhiST)
   of amova, as long as the genetic distance among allelic variants used to
   estimate FST reflects evolutionary history: in that case, neutral
   divergence is independent of mutation rate. In contrast to their common
   usage in comparisons of QST and FST, microsatellites typically have high
   mutation rates and do not evolve according to a simple evolutionary
   model, so are best avoided in QSTFST comparisons.}},

   benefitting from its close relationship to Arabidopsis thaliana; (iii)
   inbreeding tolerance enabling development of recombinant inbred lines,

   permitting mapping for genetic analysis of speciation; (v) apomixis
   (asexual reproduction by seeds) in a genetically tractable diploid; and
   (vi) broad geographic distribution in North America, permitting
   ecological genetics for a large research community. These

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of natural and anthropogenic landscape features
   on population connectivity is a major goal in evolutionary ecology and
   conservation. Discovery of dispersal barriers is important for
   predicting population responses to landscape and environmental changes,
   particularly for populations at geographic range margins. We used a
   landscape genetics approach to quantify the effects of landscape
   features on gene flow and connectivity of boreal toad (Bufo boreas)
   populations from two distinct landscapes in south-east Alaska (Admiralty
   Island, ANM, and the Chilkat River Valley, CRV). We used two common
   methodologies for calculating resistance distances in landscape genetics
   studies (resistance based on least-cost paths and circuit theory). We
   found a strong effect of saltwater on genetic distance of CRV
   populations, but no landscape effects were found for the ANM
   populations. Our discordant results show the importance of examining
   multiple landscapes that differ in the variability of their features, to
   maximize detectability of underlying processes and allow results to be
   broadly applicable across regions. Saltwater serves as a physiological
   barrier to boreal toad gene flow and affects populations on a small
   geographic scale, yet there appear to be few other barriers to toad
   dispersal in this intact northern region.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The increasing evidence for population declines in bumble bee (Bombus)
   species worldwide has accelerated research efforts to explain losses in
   these important pollinators. In North America, a number of once
   widespread Bombus species have suffered serious reductions in range and
   abundance, although other species remain healthy. To examine whether
   declining and stable species exhibit different levels of genetic
   diversity or population fragmentation, we used microsatellite markers to
   genotype populations sampled across the geographic distributions of two
   declining (Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus) and four stable
   (Bombus bifarius; Bombus vosnesenskii; Bombus impatiens and Bombus
   bimaculatus) Bombus species. Populations of declining species generally
   have reduced levels of genetic diversity throughout their range compared
   to codistributed stable species. Genetic diversity can be affected by
   overall range size and degree of isolation of local populations,
   potentially confounding comparisons among species in some cases. We find
   no evidence for consistent differences in gene flow among stable and
   declining species, with all species exhibiting weak genetic
   differentiation over large distances (e.g. >1000 km). Populations on
   islands and at high elevations experience relatively strong genetic
   drift, suggesting that some conditions lead to genetic isolation in
   otherwise weakly differentiated species. B.similar to occidentalis and
   B.similar to bifarius exhibit stronger genetic differentiation than the
   other species, indicating greater phylogeographic structure consistent
   with their broader geographic distributions across topographically
   complex regions of western North America. Screening genetic diversity in
   North American Bombus should prove useful for identifying species that
   warrant monitoring, and developing management strategies that promote
   high levels of gene flow will be a key component in efforts to maintain
   healthy populations.}},

   survival to weaning, birth mass, foot length and condition. We estimated
   the number of diploid lethal equivalents on survival to weaning as
   24.1728.72. Standardized heterozygosity (H) had a relatively small

Abstract = {{Effective management of reef corals requires knowledge of the extent to
   which populations are open or closed and the scales over which genetic
   exchange occurs, information which is commonly derived from population
   genetic data. Such data are sparse for Great Barrier Reef (GBR) corals
   and other organisms, with the studies that are available being mostly
   based on a small number of sampling locations spanning only part of the
   GBR. Using 11 microsatellite loci, we genotyped 947 colonies of the
   reef-building coral Acropora millepora from 20 sites spanning almost the
   full length of the GBR (similar to 12 degrees of latitude and similar to
   1550 km). The results show a major divide between the southernmost
   central to southern offshore populations and all other sampled
   populations. We interpret this divide as a signature of allopatric
   divergence in northern and southern refugia during the Pleistocene
   glaciations, from which the GBR was subsequently recolonized.
   Superimposed on this pattern is a cross-shelf genetic division, as well
   as a separation of inshore populations south of the Cape Clifton Front
   at similar to 21.522 degrees S. Most inshore populations north of this,
   as well as mid-shelf populations in the northern and far northern GBR,
   are open, exchanging recruits frequently. In contrast, inshore
   populations south of the Cape Clifton Front and offshore populations in
   the central and southern GBR are largely self-seeding, at least within
   the spatial resolution that was achieved given our sampling intensity.
   Populations that have been impacted by recent disturbance events causing
   extensive coral mortality show no evidence of reduced genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Rafting has long been invoked as a key marine dispersal mechanism, but
   biologists have thus far produced little genetic evidence to support
   this hypothesis. We hypothesize that coastal species associated with
   buoyant seaweeds should experience enhanced population connectivity
   owing to rafting. In particular, invertebrates strongly associated with
   the buoyant bull-kelp Durvillaea antarctica might be expected to have
   lower levels of population-genetic differentiation than taxa mainly
   exploiting nonbuoyant substrates. We undertook a comparative genetic
   study of two codistributed, congeneric chiton species, assessing
   population connectivity at scales of 61516 km, using >= 186 polymorphic
   AFLP loci per species. Consistent with predictions, population-genetic
   differentiation was weaker in the kelp-associated Sypharochiton
   sinclairi than in the rock-associated S. pelliserpentis. Additionally,
   while we found a significant positive correlation between genetic and
   oceanographic distances in both chiton species, the correlation was
   stronger in S. pelliserpentis (R2 = 0.28) than in S. sinclairi (R2 =
   0.18). These data support the hypothesis that epifaunal taxa can
   experience enhanced population-genetic connectivity as a result of their
   rafting ability.}},

Abstract = {{Small populations can provide insights into ecological and evolutionary
   aspects of species distributions over space and time. In the Wood River
   system in Alaska, USA, small aggregates of Chinook (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) and chum salmon (O. keta) spawn in an area dominated by
   sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Our objective was to determine whether these
   Chinook and chum salmon are reproductively isolated, self-sustaining
   populations, population sinks that produce returning adults but receive
   immigration, or strays from other systems that do not produce returning
   adults. DNA samples collected from adult chum salmon from 16 streams and
   Chinook salmon from four streams in the Wood River system over 3 years
   were compared to samples from large populations in the nearby Nushagak
   River system, a likely source of strays. For both species,
   microsatellite markers indicated no significant genetic differentiation
   between the two systems. Simulations of microsatellite data in a large
   source and a smaller sink population suggested that considerable
   immigration would be required to counteract the diverging effects of
   genetic drift and produce genetic distances as small as those observed,
   considering the small census sizes of the two species in the Wood River
   system. Thus, the Wood River system likely receives substantial
   immigration from neighbouring watersheds, such as the Nushagak River
   system, which supports highly productive runs. Although no data on
   population productivity in the Wood River system exist, our results
   suggest sourcesink dynamics for the two species, a finding relevant to
   other systems where salmonid population sizes are limited by habitat
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Connecting broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and population
   structure to genetic diversity on a landscape is a key step towards
   understanding historical processes of migration and adaptation. New
   genomic approaches can be used to increase the resolution of
   phylogeographic studies while reducing locus sampling effects and
   circumventing ascertainment bias. Here, we use a novel approach based on
   high-throughput sequencing to characterize genetic diversity in complete
   chloroplast genomes and >10 000 nuclear loci in switchgrass, at
   continental and landscape scales. Switchgrass is a North American
   tallgrass species, which is widely used in conservation and perennial
   biomass production, and shows strong ecotypic adaptation and population
   structure across the continental range. We sequenced 40.9 billion base
   pairs from 24 individuals from across the species range and 20
   individuals from the Indiana Dunes. Analysis of plastome sequence
   revealed 203 variable SNP sites that define eight haplogroups, which are
   differentiated by 4127 SNPs and confirmed by patterns of indel
   variation. These include three deeply divergent haplogroups, which
   correspond to the previously described lowlandupland ecotypic split and
   a novel upland haplogroup split that dates to the mid-Pleistocene. Most
   of the plastome haplogroup diversity present in the northern switchgrass
   range, including in the Indiana Dunes, originated in the mid- or upper
   Pleistocene prior to the most recent postglacial recolonization.
   Furthermore, a recently colonized landscape feature (approximately 150
   ya) in the Indiana Dunes contains several deeply divergent upland
   haplogroups. Nuclear markers also support a deep lowlandupland split,
   followed by limited gene flow, and show extensive gene flow in the local
   population of the Indiana Dunes.}},

Abstract = {{Archipelago-endemic bird radiations are familiar to evolutionary
   biologists as key illustrations of evolutionary patterns. However, such
   radiations are in fact rare events. White-eyes (Zosteropidae) are birds
   with an exceptionally high colonization and speciation potential; they
   have colonized more islands globally than any other passerine group and
   include the most species-rich bird genus. The multiplication of
   white-eye island endemics has been consistently attributed to
   independent colonizations from the mainland; the white-eyes of the Gulf
   of Guinea archipelago had been seen as a classic case, spanning as great
   a breadth of phenotypic diversity as the family worldwide. Contrary to
   this hypothesis, our molecular phylogenetic analysis places the Gulf of
   Guinea white-eyes in just two radiations, one grouping all five oceanic
   island taxa and the other grouping continental island and land-bridge
   taxa. Numerous aberrant phenotypes (traditionally grouped in the genus
   Speirops) have evolved independently over a short space of time from
   nonaberrant (Zosterops) phenotypes; the most phenotypically divergent
   species have separated as recently as 0.22 Ma. These radiations rival
   those of Darwins finches and the Hawaiian honeycreepers in terms of the
   extent of adaptive radiation per unit time, both in terms of species
   numbers and in terms of phenotypic diversity. Tempo and patterns of
   morphological divergence are strongly supportive of an adaptive
   radiation in the oceanic islands driven by ecological interactions
   between sympatric white-eyes. Here, very rapid phenotypic evolution
   mainly affected taxa derived from the youngest wave of colonization, in
   accordance with the model of asymmetric divergence owing to resource
   competition in sympatry.}},

Abstract = {{Gamete recognition proteins commonly experience positive Darwinian
   selection and evolve more rapidly than nonreproductive proteins, but the
   selective forces responsible for their adaptive diversification remain
   unclear. We examined the patterns of positive selection in the cognate
   interacting pair of proteins formed by sperm bindin and its egg receptor
   (EBR1) and in two regions of the sea urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly
   suREJ3 gene (exons 22 and 26) among four species of Strongylocentrotus
   sea urchins (S.similar to purpuratus, S.similar to droebachiensis,
   S.similar to pallidus and S.similar to franciscanus). The signatures of
   selection differed at each reproductive protein. A strong signal of
   positive selection was detected at bindin in all lineages even though
   the species compared had highly variable gamete traits and experience
   different intensities and forms of sexual selection and sexual conflict
   in nature. Weaker selection was observed at EBR1 but the small region
   studied precluded a clear understanding of the extent of sexual conflict
   between bindin and the EBR1 protein. At the suREJ3 locus, diversifying
   selection was observed in exon 22 but not exon 26, suggesting that these
   regions experience different selective pressures and evolutionary
   constraints. Positive selection was also detected within S.similar to
   pallidus at suREJ-22 because of the presence of 12 amino acid
   replacement mutations segregating at frequencies >0.10. Our results
   suggest that sexual conflict may be the predominant evolutionary
   mechanism driving the rapid diversification of reproductive proteins
   between, and polymorphism within, strongylocentrotid sea urchins.}},

Abstract = {{The suggestion that genetic divergence can arise and/or be maintained in
   the face of gene flow has been contentious since first proposed. This
   controversy and a rarity of good examples have limited our understanding
   of this process. Partially reproductively isolated taxa have been
   highlighted as offering unique opportunities for identifying the
   mechanisms underlying divergence with gene flow. The African malaria
   vector, Anopheles gambiae s.s., is widely regarded as consisting of two
   sympatric forms, thought by many to represent incipient species, the M
   and S molecular forms. However, there has been much debate about the
   extent of reproductive isolation between M and S, with one view positing
   that divergence may have arisen and is being maintained in the presence
   of gene flow, and the other proposing a more advanced speciation process
   with little realized gene flow because of low hybrid fitness. These
   hypotheses have been difficult to address because hybrids are typically
   rare (<1\%). Here, we assess samples from an area of high hybridization
   and demonstrate that hybrids are fit and responsible for extensive
   introgression. Nonetheless, we show that strong divergent selection at a
   subset of loci combined with highly asymmetric introgression has enabled
   M and S to remain genetically differentiated despite extensive gene
   flow. We propose that the extent of reproductive isolation between M and
   S varies across West Africa resulting in a geographic mosaic of
   reproductive isolation; a finding which adds further complexity to our
   understanding of divergence in this taxon and which has considerable
   implications for transgenic control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Studying geographic variation in the rate of hybridization between
   closely related species could provide a useful window on the evolution
   of reproductive isolation. Reinforcement theory predicts greater
   prezygotic isolation in areas of prolonged contact between recently
   diverged species than in areas of recent contact, which implies that old
   contact zones would be dominated by parental phenotypes with few hybrids
   (bimodal hybrid zones), whereas recent contact zones would be
   characterized by hybrid swarms (unimodal hybrid zones). Here, we
   investigate how the hybrid zones of two closely related Chinese oaks,
   Quercus mongolica and Q.similar to liaotungensis, are structured
   geographically using both nuclear and chloroplast markers. We found that
   populations of Q.similar to liaotungensis located around the Changbai
   Mountains in Northeast China, an inferred glacial refugium, were
   introgressed by genes from Q.similar to mongolica, suggesting historical
   contact between the two species in this region. However, these
   introgressed populations form sharp bimodal hybrid zones with Q.similar
   to mongolica. In contrast, populations of Q.similar to liaotungensis
   located in North China, which show no sign of ancient introgression with
   Q.similar to mongolica, form unimodal hybrid zones with Q.similar to
   mongolica. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   selection against hybrids has had sufficient time to reinforce the
   reproductive barriers between Q.similar to liaotungensis and Q.similar
   to mongolica in Northeast China but not in North China.}},

Abstract = {{With its large size, complex topography and high number of avian
   endemics, Hispaniola appears to be a likely candidate for the in situ
   speciation of its avifauna, despite the worldwide rarity of avian
   speciation within single islands. We used multilocus comparative
   phylogeography techniques to examine the pattern and history of
   divergence in 11 endemic birds representing potential within-island
   speciation events. Haplotype and allele networks from mitochondrial ND2
   and nuclear intron loci reveal a consistent pattern: phylogeographic
   divergence within or between closely related species is correlated with
   the likely distribution of ancient sea barriers that once divided
   Hispaniola into several smaller paleo-islands. Coalescent and
   mitochondrial clock dating of divergences indicate species-specific
   response to different geological events over the wide span of the
   islands history. We found no evidence that ecological or topographical
   complexity generated diversity, either by creating open niches or by
   restricting long-term gene flow. Thus, no true within-island speciation
   appears to have occurred among the species sampled on Hispaniola.
   Divergence events predating the merging of Hispaniolas paleo-island
   blocks cannot be considered in situ divergence, and postmerging
   divergence in response to episodic island segmentation by marine
   flooding probably represents in situ vicariance or interarchipelago
   speciation by dispersal. Our work highlights the necessity of
   considering island geologic history while investigating the
   speciationarea relationship in birds and other taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic divergence among populations of marine broadcast spawners in the
   absence of past geological barriers presents an intriguing challenge to
   understanding speciation in the sea. To determine how differences in
   life history affect genetic divergence and demographic histories across
   incomplete dispersal barriers, we conducted a comparative
   phylogeographic study of three intertidal limpets (Siphonaria spp.)
   represented on either side of a biogeographic disjunction separating
   tropical and subtropical marine provinces in southeastern Africa. Using
   a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, we identified
   two distinct evolutionary lineages each in both Siphonaria concinna (a
   planktonic disperser) and S. nigerrima (a direct developer), and
   panmixia in a second planktonic disperser, S. capensis. Although
   phylogeographic breaks were present in two species, how these became
   established differed depending on their life histories. In the direct
   developer, lack of gene flow following divergence, and demographic
   expansion from a small initial size in the species subtropical
   population, point to a single colonisation event. In contrast, the
   evolutionary lineages of the planktonic disperser split into two genetic
   lineages with much larger initial population sizes and southward gene
   flow continued at least periodically, indicating that divergence in this
   species may have been driven by a combination of reduced larval
   dispersal and divergent selection. These findings help explain why the
   presence or absence of phylogeographic breaks often appears to be
   independent of species dispersal potential.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in climate and sea level are hypothesized to have promoted the
   diversification of biota in monsoonal Australia and New Guinea by
   causing repeated range disjunctions and restricting gene flow between
   isolated populations. Using a multilocus (one mtDNA locus, five nuclear
   introns) phylogeographic approach, we test whether populations of the
   mangrove and rainforest restricted Black Butcherbird (Cracticus quoyi)
   have diverged across several geographic barriers defined a priori for
   this region. Phylogeographic structure and estimates of divergence times
   revealed Plio-Pleistocene divergences and long-term restricted gene flow
   of populations on either side of four major geographic barriers between
   and within Australia and New Guinea. Overall, our data are consistent
   with the hypothesis that mesic-adapted species did not disperse across
   the open dry woodlands and grasslands that dominated the transient
   palaeo-landbridges during the Plio-Pleistocene despite the presence of
   mangrove forests that might have acted as dispersal corridors for
   mesic-adapted species. Our study offers one of the first multilocus
   perspectives on the impact of changes in climate and sea level on the

Abstract = {{Niche conservatism has been proposed as the mechanism driving speciation
   in temperate montane clades through range fragmentation during climatic
   oscillations. Thus, a negative relationship between speciation rates and
   niche width is expected. Here, we test this prediction using American
   zopherine beetles. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered two clades in
   addition to that of the genus Zopherus: the genera Verodes and
   Phloeodes, which originated most likely in the Eocene, and diversified
   during the Miocene and the Pliocene. The assessment of clade niche width
   in relation to clade diversity supported the proposition of narrow
   niches leading to a higher probability of range fragmentation during
   climatic oscillations, thus increasing speciation. Additionally, almost
   all current populations of Phloeodes and Verodes are located within
   regions that retained favourable climatic conditions across warm and
   cold Pleistocene periods, suggesting that dispersal limitation is a
   strong factor controlling clade distribution. In sum, our results
   suggest that (i) niche width is a major determinant of the probability
   of speciation in temperate montane clades, by controlling the
   probability of potential range fragmentation and (ii) dispersal
   limitation is also a major determinant of the speciation process, by
   increasing the fragmentation of realized ranges even when potential
   distributions are cyclically fused during climatic oscillations. When
   dispersal limitation is extreme, as in zopherine beetles, populations
   persist just in those areas that have retained suitable conditions
   during extremes of past climatic oscillations. Paradoxically, this
   relict condition confers zopherine beetles great resilience for facing
   future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Extra-pair copulations (EPC) are the rule rather than an exception in
   socially monogamous birds, but despite widespread occurrences, the
   benefits of female infidelity remain elusive. Most attention has been
   paid to the possibility that females gain genetic benefits from EPC, and
   fitness comparisons between maternal half-siblings are considered to be
   a defining test of this hypothesis. Recently, it was shown that these
   comparisons may be confounded by within-brood maternal effects where one
   such effect may be the distribution of half-siblings in the laying
   order. However, this possibility is difficult to study as it would be
   necessary to detect the egg from which each chick hatched. In this
   study, we used a new approach for egg-chick assignment and
   cross-fostered eggs on an individual basis among a set of nests of the
   collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. After hatching, chicks were
   ascribed to mothers and therefore to individual eggs by molecular
   genetic methods. Extra-pair young predominated early in the laying
   order. Under natural conditions, this should give them a competitive
   advantage over their half-siblings, mediated by hatching asynchrony.
   However, we experimentally synchronized hatching, and after this
   treatment, extra-pair young did not outperform within-pair young in any
   studied trait including survival up to recruitment and several
   indicators of reproductive success and attractiveness. We obtained only
   modest sample sizes for the last two traits and did not test for
   extra-pair success of male offspring. Thus, we cannot exclude the
   possibility of advantages of extra-pair young during the adult phase of
   life. However, our data tentatively suggest that the more likely reason
   for females EPCs is the insurance against the infertility of a social
   mate.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm competition can produce fascinating adaptations with far-reaching
   evolutionary consequences. Social taxa make particularly interesting
   models, because the outcome of sexual selection determines the genetic
   composition of groups, with attendant sociobiological consequences.
   Here, we use molecular tools to uncover some of the mechanisms and
   consequences of sperm competition in the leaf-cutting ant Atta
   colombica, a species with extreme worker size polymorphism. Competitive
   PCR allowed quantification of the relative numbers of sperm stored by
   queens from different males, and offspring genotyping revealed how sperm
   number translated into paternity of eggs and adult workers. We
   demonstrate that fertilization success is directly related to sperm
   numbers, that stored sperm are well-mixed and that egg paternity is
   constant over time. Moreover, worker size was found to have a
   considerable genetic component, despite expectations that genetic
   effects on caste fate should be minor in species with a low degree of
   polyandry. Our data suggest that sexual conflict over paternity is
   largely resolved by the lifetime commitment between mates generated by
   long-term sperm storage, and show that genetic variation for caste can
   persist in societies with comparatively high relatedness.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports have shown that natural killer (NK) cells may be
   long-lived, possess memory-like features and may need microbial priming
   to become fully reactive. Thus, the notion that these cells are
   typically innate, nonadaptive lymphocytes has been challenged. If
   microbial priming is essential for functional maturity, it is necessary
   to raise the question whether NK cells of laboratory mice, kept under
   strict hygienic conditions, represent these cells adequately. In their
   natural habitat, mice will encounter microbes to a greater extent, and
   we here investigated whether NK cells of feral mice showed signs of
   being primed. In comparison with C57BL/6 mice raised under specific
   pathogen-free conditions, NK cells from feral mice had high expression
   of CD69, KLRG1, granzyme B and NKp46 and a higher proportion of CD27+
   cells, mostly CD11b-, as well as a higher presence in peripheral lymph
   nodes. Following cytokine stimulation, feral mouse NK cells had quickly
   inducible CD25 expression and a stronger interferon-gamma response.
   These findings indicate a high degree of pre-activation of NK cells of
   free-living mice, indicating a strong environmental impact on NK cells,
   which may be highly relevant for interpretation of studies in the mouse
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other females
   in the same population, leading to a fascinating array of possible games
   among parasites and their hosts (Davies 2000; Lyon \& Eadie 2008).
   Almost 30 years ago, Andersson \& Eriksson (1982) first suggested that
   perhaps this form of parasitism was not what it seemed-indeed, perhaps
   it was not parasitism at all! Andersson \& Eriksson (1982) observed that
   conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) was disproportionally common in
   waterfowl (Anatidae), a group of birds for which natal philopatry is
   female-biased rather than the more usual avian pattern of male-biased
   natal philopatry. Accordingly, Andersson (1984) reasoned (and
   demonstrated in an elegantly simple model) that relatedness among
   females might facilitate the evolution of CBP-prodding us to reconsider
   it as a kin-selected and possibly cooperative breeding system rather
   than a parasitic interaction. The idea was much cited but rarely tested
   empirically until recently-a number of new studies, empowered with a
   battery of molecular techniques, have now put Anderssons hypothesis to
   the test (Table 1). The results are tantalizing, but also somewhat
   conflicting. Several studies, focusing on waterfowl, have found clear
   evidence that hosts and parasites are often related (Andersson \& Ahlund
   2000; Roy Nielsen 2006; Andersson \& Waldeck 2007; Waldeck 2008;
   Jaatinen 2009; Tiedemann . 2011). However, this is not always the case
   (Semel \& Sherman 2001; Anderholm 2009; and see Poysa 2004). In a new
   study reported in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Jaatinen (2011a)
   provide yet another twist to this story that might explain not only why
   such variable results have been obtained, but also suggests that the
   games between parasites and their hosts-and the role of kinship in these
   games-may be even more complex than Andersson (1984) imagined. Indeed,
   the role of kinship in CBP may be very much one of relative degree!}},

Abstract = {{Linking temporal variations of genetic diversity, including allelic
   richness and heterozygosity, and spatio-temporal fluctuations in
   population abundance has emerged as an important tool for understanding
   demographic and evolutionary processes in natural populations. This
   so-called genetic monitoring was conducted across 12 consecutive years
   (19962007) at three sites for the feral cat, introduced onto the
   Kerguelen archipelago fifty years ago. Temporal changes in allelic
   richness and heterozygosity at 18 microsatellite DNA loci were compared
   with temporal changes in the adult population abundance index, obtained
   by typical demographic monitoring. No association was found at the
   island spatial scale, but we observed an association between genetic
   diversity and adult population indices from year to year within each
   study site. More particularly, the magnitude of successive increases or
   decreases in the adult population abundance index appeared to be the
   major factor linking the trajectories of genetic diversity and adult
   population abundance indices. Natal dispersal and/or local recruitment,
   both facilitated by high juvenile survival when the adult population
   size is small, is proposed as the major demographic processes
   contributing to such an observed pattern. Finally, we suggested avoiding
   the use of the harmonic mean as an estimator of long-term population
   size to study the relationships between demographic fluctuations and
   heterozygosity in populations characterized by strong multiannual
   density fluctuations.}},

Title = {{Genetic evidence for multiple events of hybridization between wolves and

Abstract = {{Hybridization between wild species and their domestic counterparts may
   represent a major threat to natural populations. However, high genetic
   similarity between the hybridizing taxa makes the detection of hybrids a
   difficult task and may hinder attempts to assess the impact of
   hybridization in conservation biology. In this work, we used a
   combination of 42 autosomal microsatellites together with Y-chromosome
   microsatellite-defined haplotypes and mtDNA sequences to investigate the
   occurrence and dynamics of wolfdog hybridization in the Iberian
   Peninsula. To do this, we applied a variety of Bayesian analyses and a
   parallel set of simulation studies to evaluate (i) the differences
   between Iberian wolves and dogs, (ii) the frequency and geographical
   distribution of hybridization and (iii) the directionality of
   hybridization. First, we show that Iberian wolves and dogs form two
   well-differentiated genetic entities, suggesting that introgressive
   hybridization is not a widespread phenomenon shaping both gene pools.
   Second, we found evidence for the existence of hybridization that is
   apparently restricted to more peripheral and recently expanded wolf
   populations. Third, we describe compelling evidence suggesting that the
   dynamics of hybridization in wolf populations is mediated by crosses
   between male dogs and female wolves. More importantly, the observation
   of a population showing the occurrence of a continuum of hybrid classes
   forming mixed packs may indicate that we have underestimated
   hybridization. If future studies confirm this pattern, then an
   intriguing avenue of research is to investigate how introgression from
   free-ranging domestic dogs is enabling wolf populations to adapt to the
   highly humanized habitats of southern Europe while still maintaining
   their genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic connectivity and geographic fragmentation are two opposing
   mechanisms determining the population structure of species. While the
   first homogenizes the genetic background across populations the second
   one allows their differentiation. Therefore, knowledge of processes
   affecting dispersal of marine organisms is crucial to understand their
   genetic distribution patterns and for the effective management of their
   populations. In this study, we use genetic analyses of eleven
   microsatellites in combination with oceanographic satellite and
   dispersal simulation data to determine distribution patterns for
   Serranus cabrilla, a ubiquitous demersal broadcast spawner, in the
   Mediterranean Sea. Pairwise population FST values ranged between -0.003
   and 0.135. Two genetically distinct clusters were identified, with a
   clear division located between the oceanographic discontinuities at the
   Ibiza Channel (IC) and the Almeria-Oran Front (AOF), revealing an
   admixed population in between. The Balearic Front (BF) also appeared to
   dictate population structure. Directional gene flow on the Spanish coast
   was observed as S.similar to cabrilla dispersed from west to east over
   the AOF, from north to south on the IC and from south of the IC towards
   the Balearic Islands. Correlations between genetic and oceanographic
   data were highly significant. Seasonal changes in current patterns and
   the relationship between ocean circulation patterns and spawning season
   may also play an important role in population structure around
   oceanographic fronts.}},

Abstract = {{Range expansion and contraction has occurred in the history of most
   species and can seriously impact patterns of genetic diversity.
   Historical data about range change are rare and generally appropriate
   for studies at large scales, whereas the individual pollen and seed
   dispersal events that form the basis of geneflow and colonization
   generally occur at a local scale. In this study, we investigated range
   change in Fagus sylvatica on Mont Ventoux, France, using historical data
   from 1838 to the present and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
   analyses of genetic data. From the historical data, we identified a
   population minimum in 1845 and located remnant populations at least 200
   years old. The ABC analysis selected a demographic scenario with three
   populations, corresponding to two remnant populations and one area of
   recent expansion. It also identified expansion from a smaller ancestral
   population but did not find that this expansion followed a population
   bottleneck, as suggested by the historical data. Despite a strong
   support to the selected scenario for our data set, the ABC approach
   showed a low power to discriminate among scenarios on average and a low
   ability to accurately estimate effective population sizes and divergence
   dates, probably due to the temporal scale of the study. This study
   provides an unusual opportunity to test ABC analysis in a system with a
   well-documented demographic history and identify discrepancies between
   the results of historical, classical population genetic and ABC
   analyses. The results also provide valuable insights into genetic
   processes at work at a fine spatial and temporal scale in range change
   and colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic data are rapidly advancing our understanding of various
   biological systems including the ecology and evolution of coralalgal
   symbioses. The fine-scale interactions between individual genotypes of
   host and symbiont remain largely unstudied and constitute a major gap in
   knowledge. By applying microsatellite markers developed for both host
   and symbiont, we investigated the intracolony diversity, prevalence and
   stability of Symbiodinium glynni (type D1) multilocus genotypes in
   association with dense populations of Pocillopora at two sites in the
   Gulf of California. The genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in
   reef populations of S.similar to glynni remained stable over 3 years.
   Common clone genotypes persisted over this period, and no temporal
   population subdivision (FPT = 0.021 and -0.003) was detected.
   Collections from circular plots showed no statistical correlation
   between related Pocillopora individuals and their associations with
   particular S.similar to glynni genotypes, with no spatial structuring or
   clonal aggregation across a reef for the symbiont. From permanent linear
   transects, samples were analysed from multiple locations within a colony
   and some were resampled approximately 1 year later. Many of these
   multisampled colonies (approximately 53\%) were dominated by a single
   S.similar to glynni genotype and tended to associate with the same
   symbiont genotype(s) over time, while colony ramets often possessed
   unrelated symbiont genotypes. In contrast to the species level,
   associations between genotypes of Pocillopora and S.similar to glynni
   are apparently more flexible over space and time. The abundance of
   sexually recombinant genotypes of S.similar to glynni combined with
   greater flexibility might provide adaptive mechanisms for these
   symbioses to evolve rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and
   allow particular symbiont genotypes to spread through a host population.}},

Abstract = {{Population bottlenecks can restrict variation at functional genes,
   reducing the ability of populations to adapt to new and changing
   environments. Understanding how populations generate adaptive genetic
   variation following bottlenecks is therefore central to evolutionary
   biology. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are ideal
   models for studying adaptive genetic variation due to their central role
   in pathogen recognition. While de novo MHC sequence variation is
   generated by point mutation, gene conversion can generate new haplotypes
   by transferring sections of DNA within and across duplicated MHC loci.
   However, the extent to which gene conversion generates new MHC
   haplotypes in wild populations is poorly understood. We developed a 454
   sequencing protocol to screen MHC class I exon 3 variation across all 13
   island populations of Berthelots pipit (Anthus berthelotii). We reveal
   that just 11-15 MHC haplotypes were retained when the Berthelots pipit
   dispersed across its island range in the North Atlantic ca. 75 000 years
   ago. Since then, at least 26 new haplotypes have been generated in situ
   across populations. We show that most of these haplotypes were generated
   by gene conversion across divergent lineages, and that the rate of gene
   conversion exceeded that of point mutation by an order of magnitude.
   Gene conversion resulted in significantly more changes at nucleotide
   sites directly involved with pathogen recognition, indicating selection
   for functional variants. We suggest that the creation of new variants by
   gene conversion is the predominant mechanism generating MHC variation in
   genetically depauperate populations, thus allowing them to respond to
   pathogenic challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The vitellogenin egg yolk precursor protein represents a well-studied
   case of social pleiotropy in the model organism Apis mellifera.
   Vitellogenin is associated with fecundity in queens and plays a major
   role in controlling division of labour in workers, thereby affecting
   both individual and colony-level fitness. We studied the molecular
   evolution of vitellogenin and seven other genes sequenced in a large
   population panel of Apis mellifera and several closely related species
   to investigate the role of social pleiotropy on adaptive protein
   evolution. We found a significant excess of nonsynonymous fixed
   differences between A. mellifera, A. cerana and A. florea relative to
   synonymous sites indicating high rates of adaptive evolution at
   vitellogenin. Indeed, 88\% of amino acid changes were fixed by selection
   in some portions of the gene. Further, vitellogenin exhibited hallmark
   signatures of selective sweeps in A. mellifera, including a significant
   skew in the allele frequency spectrum, extreme levels of genetic
   differentiation and linkage disequilibrium. Finally, replacement
   polymorphisms in vitellogenin were significantly enriched in parts of
   the protein involved in binding lipid, establishing a link between the
   genes structure, function and effects on fitness. Our case study
   provides unequivocal evidence of historical and ongoing bouts of
   adaptive evolution acting on a key socially pleiotropic gene in the
   honey bee.}},

Abstract = {{The functional importance of variable, transcriptional regulatory
   sequences within and among natural populations is largely unexplored. We
   analysed the cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) promoter in three populations of
   the minnow, Fundulus heteroclitus, because two SNPs in the promoter and
   first intron of CYP1A are under selection in populations adapted to
   pollutants. To define the importance of these SNPs, 1630 bp of the CYP1A
   promoter and first intron and exon were sequenced in eight individuals
   from three populations: a population from a polluted environment
   resistant to some aromatic pollutants and two flanking reference
   populations. CYP1A is induced by many aromatic pollutants, but in
   populations adapted to pollutants, CYP1A has been shown to be refractory
   to induction. We were interested in understanding whether variation in
   the CYP1A promoter explains mechanism(s) of adaptation to these aromatic
   pollutants. The CYP1A promoter was extremely variable (an average of
   9.3\% of the promoter nucleotides varied among all populations) and
   exhibited no fixed differences between populations. As CYP1A is poorly
   inducible in adapted fish, we hypothesized that CYP1A promoter regions
   might vary functionally between populations. Unexpectedly, in vitro
   analysis showed significantly greater transcription from CYP1A promoters
   found in the population from the polluted environment relative to
   promoters found in both reference populations. Thus, despite extensive
   variation among populations and lack of fixed differences between
   populations, individuals from a polluted environment have significantly
   enhanced promoter activity. These data demonstrate that intraspecific
   variation, which provides the raw material for natural selection to act
   on, can occur while maintaining promoter function.}},

Abstract = {{Inferring the history of isolation and gene flow during species
   differentiation can inform us on the processes underlying their
   formation. Following their recent expansion in Europe, two subspecies of
   the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus) have
   formed a hybrid zone maintained by hybrid incompatibilities and possibly
   behavioural reinforcement, offering a good model of incipient
   speciation. We reconstruct the history of their divergence using an
   approximate Bayesian computation framework and sequence variation at 57
   autosomal loci. We find support for a long isolation period preceding
   the advent of gene flow around 200 000 generations ago, much before the
   formation of the European hybrid zone a few thousand years ago. The
   duration of the allopatric episode appears long enough (74\% of
   divergence time) to explain the accumulation of many post-zygotic
   incompatibilities expressed in the present hybrid zone. The ancient
   contact inferred could have played a role in mating behaviour divergence
   and laid the ground for further reinforcement. We suggest that both
   subspecies originally colonized the Middle East from the northern Indian
   subcontinent, domesticus settling on the shores of the Persian Gulf and
   musculus on those of the Caspian Sea. Range expansions during
   interglacials would have induced secondary contacts, presumably in Iran,
   where they must have also interacted with Mus musculus castaneus. Future
   studies should incorporate this possibility, and we point to Iran and
   its surroundings as a hot spot for house mouse diversity and speciation
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of hybrid zones have revealed an array of evolutionary outcomes,
   yet the underlying structure is typically characterized as one of three
   types: a hybrid zone, a hybrid swarm or a hybrid taxon. Our primary
   objective was to determine which of these three structures best
   characterizes a zone of hybridization between two divergent lineages of
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), mule deer and black-tailed deer. These
   lineages are morphologically, ecologically and genetically distinct, yet
   hybridize readily along a zone of secondary contact between the east and
   west slopes of the Cascade Mountains (Washington and Oregon, USA). Using
   microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA, we found clear evidence for
   extensive hybridization and introgression between lineages, with varying
   degrees of admixture across the zone of contact. The pattern of
   hybridization in this region closely resembles a hybrid swarm; based on
   data from 10 microsatellite loci, we detected hybrids that extend well
   beyond the F1 generation, did not detect linkage disequilibrium at the
   centre of the zone and found that genotypes were associated randomly
   within the zone of contact. Introgression was characterized as
   bidirectional and symmetric, which is surprising given that the zone of
   contact occurs along a sharp ecotone and that lineages are characterized
   by large differences in body size (a key component of mating success).
   Regardless of the underlying mechanisms promoting hybrid swarm
   maintenance, it is clear that the persistence of a hybrid swarm presents
   unique challenges for management in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Patagonia is one of the few areas in the Southern Hemisphere to have
   been directly influenced by Quaternary glaciers. In this study, we
   evaluate the influence that Quaternary glacial ice had on the genetic
   diversity of two congeneric fish species, the diadromous Galaxias
   maculatus and the nondiadromous Galaxias platei, using multilocus
   estimates of effective population size through time. Mid-Quaternary
   glaciations had far-reaching consequences for both species. Galaxias
   maculatus and G. platei each experienced severe genetic bottlenecks
   during the period when Patagonia ice sheet advance reached its maximum
   positions c. 1.10.6 Ma. Concordant drops in effective size during this
   time suggest that range sizes were under similar constraints. It is
   therefore unlikely that coastal (brackish/marine) environments served as
   a significant refuge for G. maculatus during glacial periods. An earlier
   onset of population declines for G. platei suggests that this species
   was vulnerable to modest glacial advances. Declines in effective sizes
   were continuous for both species and lasted into the late-Pleistocene.
   However, G. maculatus exhibited a strong population recovery during the
   late-Quaternary (c. 400 000 bp). Unusually long and warm interglacials
   associated with the late-Quaternary may have helped to facilitate a
   strong population rebound in this primarily coastal species.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern United States is a major phylogeographic break hotspot
   for amphibians, but the processes underlying this hotspot remain to be
   explicitly tested. We test the correlation of genetic lineages with
   subspecies breaks in the southeastern United States and the association
   of such breaks with climate, using Rana sphenocephala as a case study,
   and place our results in the broader context of the Alabama-Appalachian
   suture zone (AL-Appalachian SZ). We use genetic and ecological methods
   to (i) determine whether genetic lineages are coincident with the
   AL-Appalachian SZ or the subspecies and (ii) test the correlation of
   major climatic breaks with genetic structure and morphological variation
   in R.similar to sphenocephala. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the ND1
   mtDNA gene and microsatellite cluster analyses revealed two distinct
   lineages with over 4\% sequence divergence. The geographic distributions
   of the two lineages are concordant with the AL-Appalachian SZ but do not
   correspond to the ranges of the subspecies based on morphology. Mantel
   tests revealed that isolation by distance and historical barriers to
   gene flow, rather than climate, are the major drivers of genetic
   divergence at neutral loci. Examination of climate breaks across the
   Southeast revealed a pattern incongruent with suture zone hotspots,
   suggesting that phylogenetic structure has been driven primarily by
   historical factors, such as isolation, the Appalachian Mountains and the
   Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint River Basin. However, climate breaks
   are consistent with the geographic distribution of the subspecies of
   R.similar to sphenocephala, suggesting that environmental pressures may
   be driving divergence in morphological traits that outpaces molecular
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Many temperate species experienced demographic and range contractions in
   response to climatic changes during Pleistocene glaciations. In this
   study, we investigate the evolutionary history of the Tyrrhenian tree
   frog Hyla sarda, a species inhabiting the CorsicaSardinia island system
   (Western Mediterranean basin). We used sequence analysis of two
   mitochondrial (overall 1229 bp) and three nuclear (overall 1692 bp) gene
   fragments to assess the phylogeography and demographic history of this
   species, and species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict its range
   variation over time. Phylogeographic, historical demographic and SDM
   analyses consistently indicate that H.similar to sarda does not conform
   to the scenario generally expected for temperate species but rather
   underwent demographic and range expansion mostly during the last glacial
   phase. Palaeogeographic data and SDM analyses suggest that such
   expansion was driven by the glaciation-induced increase in lowland areas
   during marine regression. This unusual scenario suggests that at least
   some temperate species may not have suffered the adverse effects of
   glacial climate on their population size and range extent, owing to the
   mitigating effects of other glaciations-induced palaeoenvironmental
   changes. We discuss previous clues for the occurrence of such a scenario
   in other species and some possible challenges with its identification.
   Early phylogeographic literature suggested that responses to the
   Pleistocene glacialinterglacial cycles were expected to vary among
   species and regions. Our results point out that such variation may have
   been greater than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Hostparasite relatedness may facilitate the evolution of conspecific
   brood parasitism, but empirical support for this contention remains
   inconclusive. One reason for this disparity may relate to the diversity
   of parasitic tactics, a key distinguishing feature being whether the
   parasite has a nest of her own. Previous work suggests that parasites
   without nests of their own may be of inferior phenotypic quality, but
   because of difficulties in identifying these parasitic individuals,
   little is known about their host selection criteria. We used
   high-resolution molecular maternity tests to assign parasitic offspring
   to known parasites with and without their own nests in a population of
   Barrows goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica). We determined whether parasite
   nesting status, hostparasite relatedness and distance between host and
   parasite nests affected the probability of parasitizing a host and the
   number of eggs laid per host. We also investigated whether nesting
   parasites, conventionally nesting females and non-nesting parasites
   differed regarding their age, structural size, body condition, nesting
   phenology or total brood size. The probability of engaging in parasitism
   increased with hostparasite relatedness and spatial proximity to host
   nests for nesting and non-nesting females alike. However, nesting
   parasites increased the number of eggs donated with relatedness to the
   host, while non-nesting parasites did not do so. Non-nesting parasites
   laid fewer eggs in total, but did not differ by any of the other quality
   measures from conventional nesters or nesting parasites. Our study
   provides the first demonstration that nesting and non-nesting parasites
   from the same population may use different host selection criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Deeply conserved molecular mechanisms regulate food-searching behaviour
   in response to nutritional cues in a wide variety of vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Studies of the highly eusocial honey bee have shown that
   nutritional physiology and some conserved nutrient signalling pathways,
   especially the insulin pathway, also regulate the division of labour
   between foraging and non-foraging individuals. Typically, lean workers
   leave the nest to forage for food, and well-nourished workers perform
   tasks inside the nest. Here we provide the first direct test of whether
   similar mechanisms operate in a primitively eusocial insect in an
   independently evolved social lineage, the paper wasp Polistes metricus.
   We found that food deprivation caused reduced lipid stores and higher
   levels of colony and individual foraging. Individuals with greatly
   reduced lipid stores foraged at extremely elevated levels. In addition,
   brain expression of several foraging-related genes was influenced by
   food deprivation, including insulin-like peptide 2 (ilp2). Together with
   previous findings, our results demonstrate that nutrition regulates
   foraging division of labour in two independently evolved social insect
   lineages (bees and wasps), despite large differences in social
   organization. Our results also provide additional support for the idea
   that nutritional asymmetries among individuals, based on differences in
   nutritional physiology and expression of conserved nutrient signalling
   genes in the brain, are important in the division of labour in eusocial
   societies.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{5348-5358}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mating with close kin can lead to inbreeding depression through the
   expression of recessive deleterious alleles and loss of heterozygosity.
   Mate selection may be affected by kin encounter rate, and inbreeding
   avoidance may not be uniform but associated with age and social system.
   Specifically, selection for kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance may
   be more developed in species that live in family groups or breed
   cooperatively. To test this hypothesis, we compared kin encounter rate
   and the proportion of related breeding pairs in noninbred and highly
   inbred canid populations. The chance of randomly encountering a full sib
   ranged between 18\% and 2022\% in noninbred and inbred canid
   populations, respectively. We show that regardless of encounter rate,
   outside natal groups mates were selected independent of relatedness.
   Within natal groups, there was a significant avoidance of mating with a
   relative. Lack of discrimination against mating with close relatives
   outside packs suggests that the rate of inbreeding in canids is related
   to the proximity of close relatives, which could explain the high degree
   of inbreeding depression observed in some populations. The idea that kin
   encounter rate and social organization can explain the lack of
   inbreeding avoidance in some species is intriguing and may have
   implications for the management of populations at risk.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly 25 years ago, Ellstrand \& Roose (1987) reviewed what was known

   pointed out how little we know about the population biology of clonal
   organisms like dandelions and aphids. He wondered whether, like good
   curries, outward appearances masked common ingredients. Because in no
   small part of the advent of molecular ecology, we know more about clonal
   life histories today, particularly in plants (van Dijk 2003;
   Vallejo-Marin et al. 2010). Surprisingly, studies of the spatial
   architecture of aphid clones have been comparably rare. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Vantaux et al. characterize the fine-scale
   distribution of the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) and in so doing, help
   to fill that gap. They describe a moderate degree of intermingling
   between aphid clones over a growing season-A. fabae clones are `sticky',
   but only a bit. By mixing, clones directly compete with each other as
   well. The results of Vantaux et al. (2011) will help to integrate
   evolutionary patterns in aphids with the appropriate ecological scales
   out of which those patterns emerge.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of how ecological traits influence past species
   response to environmental change can aid our future predictions of
   species persistence. We used ancient DNA and serial coalescent modelling

   rodents that currently differ in rarity (abundance, range size and
   habitat specificity) and mating system, but that reside in the same
   volcanically active region. Comparative phylochronologic analyses
   indicated little genetic change and suggest genetic stability in the
   solitary widespread Ctenomys haigi over thousands of years. In contrast,
   we found a pattern of haplotypic turnover in the rare and currently
   endangered Ctenomys sociabilis. Serial coalescent modelling indicated
   that the best-fit models of microevolutionary change included gene flow
   between isolated populations for this species. Although C. haigi and C.
   sociabilis are congeners that share many life history traits, they have
   behavioural, habitat-preference and population-size differences that may
   have resulted in contrasting patterns of temporal variation during

Abstract = {{Population density and individual dispersal behaviour affect species'
   distribution dynamics. Population densities vary over time, and some
   species occasionally increase to very high numbers, for example during
   outbreaks. In such situations, populations are expected to expand into
   new areas as a result of density-dependent dispersal which sometimes
   even results in range expansion. A local population of the northern pine
   processionary moth Thaumetopoea pinivora has recently reached outbreak
   densities at the edge of its northern range at the southern tip of
   Gotland Island in the Baltic Sea. We first investigated whether the
   outbreak had resulted in establishment of populations in suitable
   habitats on Gotland Island outside the outbreak area. Six small
   populations were found that could potentially have originated from the
   outbreak area. However, data from 12 microsatellite markers strongly
   suggest that these populations did not originate from the recent
   outbreak. Genetic variability was not reduced in these small, isolated
   populations, and there were several unique alleles, indicating instead a
   different population history and that there has been no recent range
   expansion. In addition, there was apparent genetic isolation by
   geographic distance, implying that despite the high density of the
   outbreak population, significant gene flow has not occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative analyses of spatial genetic structure of populations of
   plants and the insects they interact with provide an indication of how
   gene flow, natural selection and genetic drift may jointly influence the
   distribution of genetic variation and potential for local co-adaptation
   for interacting species. Here, we analysed the spatial scale of genetic
   structure within and among nine populations of an interacting species
   pair, the white campion Silene latifolia and the moth Hadena bicruris,
   along a latitudinal gradient across Northern/Central Europe. This
   dioecious, short-lived perennial plant inhabits patchy, often disturbed
   environments. The moth H. bicruris acts both as its pollinator and
   specialist seed predator that reproduces by laying eggs in S. latifolia
   flowers. We used nine microsatellite markers for S. latifolia and eight
   newly developed markers for H. bicruris. We found high levels of
   inbreeding in most populations of both plant and pollinator/seed
   predator. Among populations, significant genetic structure was observed
   for S. latifolia but not for its pollinator/seed predator, suggesting
   that despite migration among populations of H. bicruris, pollen is not,
   or only rarely, carried over between populations, thus maintaining
   genetic structure among plant populations. There was a weak positive
   correlation between genetic distances of S. latifolia and H. bicruris.
   These results indicate that while significant structure of S. latifolia
   populations creates the potential for differentiation at traits relevant
   for the interaction with the pollinator/seed predator, substantial gene
   flow in H. bicruris may counteract this process in at least some
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the factors influencing genetic differentiation is an
   important task in biology, and the relative contribution from natural
   selection and genetic drift has long been debated. In this study, we
   used a regression-based approach to simultaneously estimate the
   quantitative contributions of environmental adaptation and isolation by
   distance on genetic variation in Boechera stricta, a wild relative of
   Arabidopsis. Patterns of discrete and continuous genetic differentiation
   coexist within this species. For the discrete differentiation between
   two major genetic groups, environment has larger contribution than
   geography, and we also identified a significant environment-by-geography
   interaction effect. Elsewhere in the species range, we found a
   latitudinal cline of genetic variation reflecting only isolation by
   distance. To further confirm the effect of environmental selection on
   genetic divergence, we identified the specific environmental variables
   predicting local genotypes in allopatric and sympatric regions. Water
   availability was identified as the possible cause of differential local
   adaptation in both geographical regions, confirming the role of
   environmental adaptation in driving and maintaining genetic
   differentiation between the two major genetic groups. In addition, the
   environment-by-geography interaction is further confirmed by the finding
   that water availability is represented by different environmental
   factors in the allopatric and sympatric regions. In conclusion, this
   study shows that geographical and environmental factors together created
   stronger and more discrete genetic differentiation than isolation by
   distance alone, which only produced a gradual, clinal pattern of genetic
   variation. These findings emphasize the importance of environmental
   selection in shaping patterns of species-wide genetic variation in the
   natural environment.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding factors that shape patterns of kinship in sedentary
   species is important for evolutionary ecologists as well as conservation
   biologists. Yet, how patterns of relatedness are hierarchically
   structured in space remains poorly known, even in common species. Here,
   we use information from 16 polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers to
   study how small-scale kinship structure varies among house sparrows
   (Passer domesticus) along an urban-rural gradient. Average levels of
   relatedness were higher among urban individuals than among individuals
   from rural areas, suggesting lower rates of dispersal in more built-up
   habitats. Comparison of observed levels of relatedness with simulated
   distributions of known kinship values showed that central urban
   individuals had the highest proportion of closely related conspecifics
   in their immediate neighbourhood. Spatial auto-correlograms supported
   this small-scale genetic structure and further indicated stronger
   effects of genetic drift and/or limited dispersal in urban populations.
   Results of this study underscore the importance of individual-level
   analyses as a complementary approach to traditional population-level

Abstract = {{Correct identification of the source population of an invasive species
   is a prerequisite for testing hypotheses concerning the factors
   responsible for biological invasions. The native area of invasive
   species may be large, poorly known and/or genetically structured.
   Because the actual source population may not have been sampled, studies
   based on molecular markers may generate incorrect conclusions about the
   origin of introduced populations. In this study, we characterized the
   genetic structure of the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis in its
   native area using various population genetic statistics and methods. We
   found that native area of H. axyridis most probably consisted of two
   geographically distinct genetic clusters located in eastern and western
   Asia. We then performed approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analyses
   on controlled simulated microsatellite data sets to evaluate (i) the
   risk of selecting incorrect introduction scenarios, including admixture
   between sources, when the populations of the native area are genetically
   structured and sampling is incomplete and (ii) the ability of ABC
   analysis to minimize such risks by explicitly including unsampled
   populations in the scenarios compared. Finally, we performed additional
   ABC analyses on real microsatellite data sets to retrace the origin of
   biocontrol and invasive populations of H. axyridis, taking into account
   the possibility that the structured native area may have been
   incompletely sampled. We found that the invasive population in eastern
   North America, which has served as the bridgehead for worldwide invasion
   by H. axyridis, was probably formed by an admixture between the eastern
   and western native clusters. This admixture may have facilitated
   adaptation of the bridgehead population.}},

Abstract = {{This study tests how divergent natural selection promotes genomic
   differentiation during ecological speciation. Specifically, we use
   adaptive ecological divergence (here, population divergence in host
   plant use and preference) as a proxy for selection strength and evaluate
   the correlation between levels of adaptive and genetic differentiation
   across pairwise population comparisons. Positive correlations would
   reveal the pattern predicted by our hypothesis, that of `isolation by
   adaptation' (IBA). Notably, IBA is predicted not only for selected loci
   but also for neutral loci. This may reflect the effects of divergent
   selection on neutral loci that are `loosely linked' to divergently
   selected loci or on geneflow restriction that facilitates genetic drift
   at all loci, including neutral loci that are completely unlinked to
   those evolving under divergent selection. Here, we evaluate IBA in
   maple-and willow-associated populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf
   beetles. To do so, we collected host preference data to construct
   adaptive divergence indices and used AFLPs (amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms) and mitochondrial sequences to quantify genetic
   differentiation. Partial Mantel tests showed significant IBA in `pooled'
   analyses of putatively neutral and of putatively selected ('outlier')
   AFLP loci. This pattern was also recovered in 12\% of `locus-specific'
   analyses that separately evaluated genetic differentiation at individual
   neutral loci. These results provided evidence for widespread effects of
   selection on neutral genomic divergence. Our collective findings
   indicate that host-related selection may play important roles in the
   population genomic differentiation of both neutral and selected gene
   regions in herbivorous insects.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivated plants have been selected by humans for increased yield in a
   relatively benign environment, where nutrient and water resources are
   often supplemented, and biotic enemy loads are kept artificially low.
   Agricultural weeds have adapted to this same benign environment as crops
   and often have high growth and reproductive rates, even though they have
   not been specifically selected for yield. Considering the competing
   demands for resources in any plant, a key question is whether adaptation
   to agricultural environments has been accompanied by life history
   trade-offs, in which resistance to (largely absent) stress has been lost
   in favour of growth and reproduction. The experiments reported here were
   designed to test for growth-defence trade-offs in agricultural weeds,
   crops and native varieties of common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.,
   Asteraceae) by comparing their performance in the presence or absence of
   abiotic (drought and crowding) or biotic (simulated herbivory, insect
   herbivory and fungal) stress. We found that growth, as well as viability
   of crops and weeds, was reduced by abiotic drought stress. The weakened
   defence in the agricultural genotypes was further evident as increased
   susceptibility to fungal infection and higher level of insect
   palatability. To uncover molecular mechanisms underlying these
   trade-offs, we monitored gene expression kinetics in drought-stressed
   plants. By correlating phenotypic observations with molecular analyses,
   we report the identification of several genes, including a protein
   phosphatase 2C and the HD-Zip transcription factor Athb-8, whose
   expression is associated with the observed phenotypic variation in
   common sunflower.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of immunity in wild populations have focused primarily
   on genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); however, studies
   of model species have identified additional immune-related genes that
   also affect fitness. In this study, we sequenced five non-MHC immune
   genes in six greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) populations
   that have experienced varying degrees of genetic drift as a consequence
   of population bottlenecks and fragmentation. We compared patterns of
   geographic variation at the immune genes with six neutral microsatellite
   markers to investigate the relative effects of selection and genetic
   drift. Global F-ST outlier tests identified positive selection on just
   one of five immune genes (IAP-1) in one population. In contrast, at
   other immune genes, standardized G'(ST) values were lower than those at
   microsatellites for a majority of pairwise population comparisons,
   consistent with balancing selection or with species-wide positive or
   purifying selection resulting in similar haplotype frequencies across
   populations. The effects of genetic drift were also evident as summary
   statistics (e.g., Tajima's D) did not differ from neutrality for the
   majority of cases, and immune gene diversity (number of haplotypes per
   gene) was correlated positively with population size. In summary, we
   found that both genetic drift and selection shaped variation at the five
   immune genes, and the strength and type of selection varied among genes.
   Our results caution that neutral forces, such as drift, can make it
   difficult to detect current selection on genes.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic notothenioid fishes represent a rare example of a marine
   species flock. They evolved special adaptations to the extreme
   environment of the Southern Ocean including antifreeze glycoproteins.
   Although lacking a swim bladder, notothenioids have diversified from
   their benthic ancestor into a wide array of water column niches, such as
   epibenthic, semipelagic, cryopelagic and pelagic habitats. Applying
   stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope analyses to gain information
   on feeding ecology and foraging habitats, we tested whether ecological
   diversification along the benthic-pelagic axis followed a single
   directional trend in notothenioids, or whether it evolved independently
   in several lineages. Population samples of 25 different notothenioid
   species were collected around the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Orkneys
   and the South Sandwich Islands. The C and N stable isotope signatures
   span a broad range (mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between -25.4
   parts per thousand and -21.9 parts per thousand and between 8.5 parts
   per thousand and 13.8 parts per thousand, respectively), and pairwise
   niche overlap between four notothenioid families was highly significant.
   Analysis of isotopic disparity-through-time on the basis of Bayesian
   inference and maximum-likelihood phylogenies, performed on a
   concatenated mitochondrial (cyt b) and nuclear gene (myh6, Ptr and tbr1)
   data set (3148 bp), showed that ecological diversification into
   overlapping feeding niches has occurred multiple times in parallel in
   different notothenioid families. This convergent diversification in
   habitat and trophic ecology is a sign of interspecific competition and
   characteristic for adaptive radiations.}},

Abstract = {{In the early stages of reproductive isolation, genomic regions of
   reduced recombination are expected to show greater levels of
   differentiation, either because gene flow between species is reduced in
   these regions or because the effects of selection at linked sites within
   species are enhanced in these regions. Here, we study the patterns of
   DNA sequence variation at 27 autosomal loci among populations of Mus
   musculus musculus, M. m. domesticus, and M. m. castaneus, three
   subspecies of house mice with collinear genomes. We found that some loci
   exhibit considerable shared variation among subspecies, while others
   exhibit fixed differences. We used an isolation-with-gene-flow model to
   estimate divergence times and effective population sizes (N-e) and to
   disentangle ancestral variation from gene flow. Estimates of divergence
   time indicate that all three subspecies diverged from one another within
   a very short period of time approximately 350 000 years ago. Overall,
   N-e for each subspecies was associated with the degree of genetic
   differentiation: M. m. musculus had the smallest N-e and the greatest
   proportion of monophyletic gene genealogies, while M. m. castaneus had
   the largest N-e and the smallest proportion of monophyletic gene
   genealogies. M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus were more
   differentiated from each other than either were from M. m. castaneus,
   consistent with greater reproductive isolation between M. m. domesticus
   and M. m. musculus. F-ST was significantly greater at loci experiencing
   low recombination rates compared to loci experiencing high recombination
   rates in comparisons between M. m. castaneus and M. m. musculus or M. m.
   domesticus. These results provide evidence that genomic regions with
   less recombination show greater differentiation, even in the absence of
   chromosomal rearrangements.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, cryptic speciation has been discovered in an
   increasing number of taxa. Species complexes are useful models for the
   understanding of speciation processes. Motivated by the discovery of
   brooding specimens in the common Atlanto-Mediterranean broadcast
   spawning brittle star, Ophioderma longicauda, a recent study revealed
   the occurrence of divergent mitochondrial lineages. We analysed 218
   specimens from 23 locations spread over the geographic range of the
   species with partial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. A
   subset of this sample was also surveyed with the internal transcribed
   spacer of the ribosomal DNA cluster (nuclear ITS-1). Our study revealed
   six highly divergent mitochondrial lineages, and the ITS-1 data
   confirmed that they most likely represent a species complex. Geographic
   ranges, abundances and genetic structures are contrasted among the
   putative cryptic species. Lineages in which brooding specimens have been
   found form a monophyletic group and are restricted to the Eastern
   Mediterranean basin, an oligotrophic zone. A phylogeny-trait association
   analysis revealed a phylogenetic signal for low `chlorophyll a' values
   (our proxy for oligotrophy). An ecological shift related to the hyper
   oligotrophy of the Eastern Mediterranean region is therefore likely to
   have played a role in the evolution of brooding. This study revealed
   that a complex mixture of vicariance, population expansion, adaptive
   divergence and possibly high local diversification rates resulting from
   brooding has shaped the evolution of this species complex. The dating
   analysis showed that these events probably occurred in the Pleistocene
   epoch.}},

Abstract = {{Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is one of the world's oldest
   cultivated cereals, with several lines of recent evidence indicating
   that it was grown in northern China from at least 10 000 cal BP.
   Additionally, a cluster of archaeobotanical records of P. miliaceum
   dated to at least 7000 cal BP exists in eastern Europe. These two
   centres of early records could either represent independent
   domestications or cross-continental movement of this cereal that would
   predate that of any other crop by some 2 millennia. Here, we analysed
   genetic diversity among 98 landrace accessions from across Eurasia using
   16 microsatellite loci, to explore phylogeographic structure in the Old
   World range of this historically important crop. The major genetic split
   in the data divided the accessions into an eastern and a western
   grouping with an approximate boundary in northwestern China. A
   substantial number of accessions belonging to the `western' genetic
   group were also found in northeastern China. Further resolution
   subdivided the western and eastern genepools into 2 and 4 clusters
   respectively, each showing clear geographic patterning. The genetic data
   are consistent with both the single and multiple domestication centre
   hypotheses and add specific detail to what these hypotheses would entail
   regarding the spread of broomcorn millet. Discrepancies exist between
   the predictions from the genetic data and the current archaeobotanical
   record, highlighting priorities for investigation into early farming in
   Central Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Aphids are a worldwide pest and an important model in ecology and
   evolution. Little is known, however, about the genetic structure of
   their colonies at a microgeographic level. For example, it remains
   largely unknown whether most species form monoclonal or polyclonal
   colonies. Here, we present the first detailed study on levels of clonal
   mixing in a nonsocial facultative ant mutualist, the black bean aphid
   Aphis fabae. In contrast to the earlier suggestion that colonies of this
   species are generally monoclonal, we found that across two subspecies of
   the black bean aphid, A. fabae cirsiiacanthoidis and A. fabae fabae,
   32\% and 67\% of the aphid colonies were in fact polyclonal, consisting
   of a mix of up to four different clones, which resulted in an overall
   average relatedness within colonies of 0.90 and 0.79 in the two
   subspecies. Data further show that the average relatedness in A. f.
   cirsiiacanthoidis remained relatively constant throughout the season,
   which means that clonal erosion due to clonal selection more or less
   balanced with the influx of new clones from elsewhere. Nevertheless,
   relatedness tended to decrease over the lifetime of a given colony,
   implying that clonal mixing primarily resulted from the joining of
   pre-existing colonies as opposed to via simultaneous host colonisation
   by several foundresses. Widespread clonal mixing is argued to affect the
   ecology and evolution of the aphids in various important ways, for
   example with respect to the costs and benefits of group living, the
   evolution of dispersal and the interaction with predators as well as
   with the ant mutualists.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in a multitude of taxa have described a correlation between
   heterozygosity and fitness and usually conclude that this is evidence
   for inbreeding depression. Here, we have used multilocus heterozygosity
   (MLH) estimates from 15 microsatellite markers to show evidence of
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) in a long-distance migratory
   bird, the light-bellied Brent goose. We found significant, positive
   heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlations between random subsets of the
   markers we employed, and no evidence that a model containing all loci as
   individual predictors in a multiple regression explained significantly
   more variation than a model with MLH as a single predictor.
   Collectively, these results lend support to the hypothesis that the HFCs
   we have observed are a function of inbreeding depression. However, we do
   find that fitness correlations are only detectable in years where
   population-level productivity is high enough for the reproductive
   asymmetry between high and low heterozygosity individuals to become
   apparent. We suggest that lack of evidence of heterozygosity-fitness
   correlations in animal systems may be because heterozygosity is a poor
   proxy measure of inbreeding, especially when employing low numbers of
   markers, but alternatively because the asymmetries between individuals
   of different heterozygosities may only be apparent when environmental
   effects on fitness are less pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative breeders, the tension between the opposing forces of kin
   selection and kin competition is at its most severe. Although philopatry
   facilitates kin selection, it also increases the risk of inbreeding.
   When dispersal is limited, extra-pair paternity might be an important
   mechanism to avoid inbreeding, but evidence for this is equivocal. The
   red-winged fairy-wren is part of a genus of cooperative breeders with
   extreme levels of promiscuity and male philopatry, but is unique in that
   females are also strongly philopatric. Here, we test the hypothesis that
   promiscuity is an important inbreeding avoidance mechanism when both
   sexes are philopatric. Levels of extra-pair paternity were substantial
   (70\% of broods), but did not arise through females mating with their
   helpers, but via extra-group mating. Offspring were more likely to be
   sired by extra-pair males when the social pair was closely related, and
   these extra-pair males were genetically less similar to the female than
   the social male and thus, inbreeding is avoided through extra-pair
   mating. Females were consistent in their choice of the extra-pair sire
   over time and preferred early moulting males. Despite neighbouring males
   often being close kin, they sired 37\% of extra-pair offspring. However,
   females that gained paternity from neighbours were typically less
   related to them than females that gained paternity further away. Our
   study is the first to suggest that mating with both closely related
   social partners and neighbours is avoided. Such sophistication in
   inbreeding avoidance strategies is remarkable, as the extreme levels of
   promiscuity imply that social context may provide little cue to
   relatedness.}},

Abstract = {{Legume plants can obtain combined nitrogen for their growth in an

   effective, nitrogen-fixing, symbioses only with the appropriate

   rhizobia are well studied, but more information is needed on the
   properties of the host plants. The Caucasus region in Eurasia has been
   identified as the gene centre (centre of origin) of G. orientalis,

   region. In this study, the diversity of these two Galega species in
   Caucasus was investigated to test the hypothesis that in this region G.

Abstract = {{Microorganisms are a tremendously large and diverse group spanning
   multiple kingdoms, yet they have been considerably under-studied by
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists compared to their larger
   relatives. Although a few microbial species have become the stars of
   laboratory experiments, relatively few studies have examined microbial
   species in their natural habitats. As such, the question of whether
   microbial diversity parallels that of larger bodied species is
   contentious (Lachance 2004; Fenchel \& Finlay 2004). It has been
   suggested that large population sizes, high dispersal potential and low
   extinction rates lead to genetically homogeneous populations of
   microbial species over large geographical scales-arguments that bring to
   mind discussions about speciation and population structure in the marine
   environment. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Herrera et al. (2011)
   add to this debate by examining 91 isolates of the flower-living yeast
   Metschnikowia gruessii from southeastern Spain. Their AFLP results
   support both spatial structuring of genetic diversity across the region,
   as well as microsite-dependent diversifying selection within single
   flowers. This study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that
   although microbes have much larger population sizes and many differ in
   their principal mode of reproduction (primarily clonal rather than
   sexual), patterns of genetic diversity and phylogenetic structure for

Title = {{Competitive exclusion: phylogeography's `elephant in the room'?}},

Pages = {{4388-4394}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic and evolutionary research programmes have successfully
   elucidated compelling genetic signatures of earth history. Particularly
   influential achievements include the demonstration of postglacial
   recolonization patterns for high-latitude taxa and phylogenetic
   demonstration of the `progression rule' along oceanic island chains such
   as Hawaii. While both of these major biogeographic patterns clearly rely
   on rapid dispersal over long distances, their phylogeographic detection
   also apparently relies on the competitive exclusion of secondary
   dispersers. Such exclusion could occur either between or within species
   and might reflect fitness differences between lineages or,
   alternatively, neutral demographic processes (e. g. `high-density
   blocking'). Regardless, such spatial genetic patterns would be rapidly
   eroded were it not for the failure of subsequent dispersers to
   contribute genetically to newly colonized populations. In addition to
   its role in revealing colonization patterns, competitive exclusion may
   also explain the maintenance of historic phylogeographic disjunctions
   long after the original physical barriers to dispersal have ceased to
   exist. Additionally, some of the most persuasive evidence of competitive
   exclusion comes from studies of anthropogenic extinction, where
   surviving lineages have subsequently expanded their ranges, apparently
   benefitting from the demise of their prehistoric sisters. Broadly, these
   biogeographic paradigms are united by the `disconnect' between dispersal
   and colonization success, the latter being heavily influenced by
   inter-and intraspecific competition. Despite its apparent importance,
   such exclusion (especially within species) has received virtually no
   attention in the phylogeographic literature. Future studies should aim
   to test directly for the role of competitive exclusion in constraining
   the biogeography of highly dispersive taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Vast amounts of effort have been devoted to investigate patterns of
   genetic diversity and structuring in plants and animals, but similar
   information is scarce for organisms of other kingdoms. The study of the
   genetic structure of natural populations of wild yeasts can provide
   insights into the ecological and genetic correlates of clonality, and
   into the generality of recent hypotheses postulating that microbial
   populations lack the potential for genetic divergence and allopatric
   speciation. Ninety-one isolates of the flower-living yeast Metschnikowia
   gruessii from southeastern Spain were DNA fingerprinted using amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Genetic diversity and
   structuring was investigated with band-based methods and model-and
   nonmodel-based clustering. Linkage disequilibrium tests were used to
   assess reproduction mode. Microsite-dependent, diversifying selection
   was tested by comparing genetic characteristics of isolates from bumble
   bee vectors and different floral microsites. AFLP polymorphism (91\%)
   and genotypic diversity were very high. Genetic diversity was spatially
   structured, as shown by AMOVA (Phi(st) = 0.155) and clustering. The null
   hypothesis of random mating was rejected, clonality seeming the
   prevailing reproductive mode in the populations studied. Genetic
   diversity of isolates declined from bumble bee mouthparts to floral
   microsites, and frequency of five AFLP markers varied significantly
   across floral microsites, thus supporting the hypothesis of diversifying
   selection on clonal lineages. Wild populations of clonal fungal microbes
   can exhibit levels of genetic diversity and spatial structuring that are
   not singularly different from those shown by sexually reproducing plants
   or animals. Microsite-dependent, divergent selection can maintain high
   local and regional genetic diversity in microbial populations despite
   extensive clonality.}},

Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) forms an integral component
   of the vertebrate immune response and, due to strong selection
   pressures, is one of the most polymorphic regions of the entire genome.
   Despite over 15 years of research, empirical studies offer highly
   contradictory explanations of the relative roles of different
   evolutionary forces, selection and genetic drift, acting on MHC genes
   during population bottlenecks. Here, we take a meta-analytical approach
   to quantify the results of studies into the effects of bottlenecks on
   MHC polymorphism. We show that the consequences of selection acting on
   MHC loci prior to a bottleneck event, combined with drift during the
   bottleneck, will result in overall loss of MHC polymorphism that is
   similar to 15\% greater than loss of neutral genetic diversity. These
   results are counter to general expectations that selection should
   maintain MHC polymorphism, but do agree with the results of recent
   simulation models and at least two empirical studies. Notably, our
   results suggest that negative frequency-dependent selection could be
   more important than overdominance for maintaining high MHC polymorphism
   in pre-bottlenecked populations.}},

Title = {{Fragmentation can increase spatial genetic structure without decreasing

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4421-4432}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fragmentation reduces population sizes, increases isolation between
   habitats and can result in restricted dispersal of pollen and seeds.
   Given that diploid seed dispersal contributes more to shaping fine-scale
   spatial genetic structure (SGS) than haploid pollen flow, we tested
   whether fine-scale SGS can be sensitive to fragmentation even if
   extensive pollen dispersal is maintained. Castanopsis sclerophylla
   (Lindley \& Paxton) Schottky (Fagaceae), a wind-pollinated and gravity
   seed-dispersed tree, was studied in an area of southeast China where its
   populations have been fragmented to varying extents by human activity.
   Using different age classes of trees in areas subject to varying extents
   of fragmentation, we found no significant difference in genetic
   diversity between prefragmentation vs. postfragmentation C. sclerophylla
   subpopulations. Genetic differentiation among postfragmentation
   subpopulations was also only slightly lower than among prefragmentation
   subpopulations. In the most fragmented habitat, selfing rates were
   significantly higher than zero in prefragmentation, but not
   postfragmentation, cohorts. These results suggest that fragmentation had
   not decreased gene flow among these populations and that pollen flow
   remains extensive. However, significantly greater fine-scale SGS was
   found in postfragmentation subpopulations in the most fragmented
   habitat, but not in less fragmented habitats. This alteration in SGS
   reflected more restricted seed dispersal, induced by changes in the
   physical environments and the prevention of secondary seed dispersal by
   rodents. An increase in SGS can therefore result from more restricted
   seed dispersal, even in the face of extensive pollen flow, making it a
   sensitive indicator of the negative consequences of population
   fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Asexual reproduction is commonly thought to be associated with low
   genetic diversity in animals. Echmepteryx hageni (Insecta: `Psocoptera')
   is one of several psocopteran species that are primarily
   parthenogenetic, but also exists in small, isolated sexual populations.
   We used mitochondrial DNA sequences to investigate the population
   history and genealogical relationships between the sexual and asexual
   forms of this species. The asexual population of E. hageni exhibits
   extremely high mitochondrial haplotype diversity (H = 0.98), whereas the
   sexual forms had significantly lower haplotypic diversity (H = 0.25,
   after correcting for sample size). This diversity in asexuals represents
   one the greatest genetic diversities reported for asexual animals in the
   literature. Nucleotide diversities were also higher in asexual compared
   to sexual populations (pi = 0.0071 vs. 0.00027). Compared to other
   reported estimates of pi in insects, asexual nucleotide diversity is
   high, but not remarkably elevated. Three hypotheses might explain the
   elevated genetic diversity of asexual populations: (i) larger effective
   population size, (ii) greater mutation rate or (iii) possible recent
   origin of sexuals. In addition, phylogeographic analysis revealed little
   geographic structure among asexual E. hageni, although specimens from
   the upper Midwest form a single clade and are genetically
   differentiated. The mismatch distribution and neutrality tests indicate
   a historical population size increase, possibly associated with
   expansion from glacial refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Allozyme and microsatellite data from numerous populations of Drosophila
   buzzatii have been used (i) to determine to what degree N-e varies among
   generations within populations, and among populations, and (ii) to
   evaluate the congruence of four temporal and five single-sample
   estimators of N-e. Effective size of different populations varied over
   two orders of magnitude, most populations are not temporally stable in
   genetic composition, and N-e showed large variation over generations in
   some populations. Shortterm N-e estimates from the temporal methods were
   highly correlated, but the smallest estimates were the most precise for
   all four methods, and the most consistent across methods. Except for one
   population, N-e estimates were lower when assuming gene flow than when
   assuming populations that were closed. However, attempts to jointly
   estimate N-e and immigration rate were of little value because the
   source of migrants was unknown. Correlations among the estimates from
   the single-sample methods generally were not significant although, as
   for the temporal methods, estimates were most consistent when they were
   small. These single-sample estimates of current N-e are generally
   smaller than the short-term temporal estimates. Nevertheless, population
   genetic variation is not being depleted, presumably because of past or
   ongoing migration. A clearer picture of current and short-term effective
   population sizes will only follow with better knowledge of migration
   rates between populations. Different methods are not necessarily
   estimating the same N-e, they are subject to different bias, and the
   biology, demography and history of the population(s) may affect
   different estimators differently.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental shifts accompanying salmon spawning migrations from ocean
   feeding grounds to natal freshwater streams can be severe, with the
   underlying stress often cited as a cause of increased mortality. Here, a
   salmonid microarray was used to characterize changes in gene expression
   occurring between ocean and river habitats in gill and liver tissues of
   wild migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka Walbaum) returning to
   spawn in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. Expression profiles
   indicate that the transcriptome of migrating salmon is strongly affected
   by shifting abiotic and biotic conditions encountered along migration
   routes. Conspicuous shifts in gene expression associated with changing
   salinity, temperature, pathogen exposure and dissolved oxygen indicate
   that these environmental variables most strongly impact physiology
   during spawning migrations. Notably, transcriptional changes related to
   osmoregulation were largely preparatory and occurred well before salmon
   encountered freshwater. In the river environment, differential
   expression of genes linked with elevated temperatures indicated that
   thermal regimes within the Fraser River are approaching tolerance limits
   for adult salmon. To empirically correlate gene expression with
   survival, biopsy sampling of gill tissue and transcriptomic profiling
   were combined with telemetry. Many genes correlated with environmental
   variables were differentially expressed between premature mortalities
   and successful migrants. Parametric survival analyses demonstrated a
   broad-scale transcriptional regulator, cofactor required for Sp1
   transcriptional activation (CRSP), to be significantly predictive of
   survival. As the environmental characteristics of salmon habitats
   continue to change, establishing how current environmental conditions
   influence salmon physiology under natural conditions is critical to
   conserving this ecologically and economically important fish species.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection drives local adaptation, potentially even at small
   temporal and spatial scales. As a result, adaptive genetic and
   phenotypic divergence can occur among populations living in different
   habitats. We investigated patterns of differentiation between
   contrasting lake and stream habitats in the cyprinid fish European
   minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) at both the morphological and genomic levels
   using geometric morphometrics and AFLP markers, respectively. We also
   used a spatial correlative approach to identify AFLP loci associated
   with environmental variables representing potential selective forces
   responsible for adaptation to divergent habitats. Our results identified
   different morphologies between lakes and streams, with lake fish
   presenting a deeper body and caudal peduncle compared to stream fish.
   Body shape variation conformed to a priori predictions concerning
   biomechanics and swimming performance in lakes vs. streams. Moreover,
   morphological differentiation was found to be associated with several
   environmental variables, which could impose selection on body and caudal
   peduncle shape. We found adaptive genetic divergence between these
   contrasting habitats in the form of `outlier' loci (2.9\%) whose genetic
   divergence exceeded neutral expectations. We also detected additional
   loci (6.6\%) not associated with habitat type (lake vs. stream), but
   contributing to genetic divergence between populations. Specific
   environmental variables related to trophic dynamics, landscape
   topography and geography were associated with several neutral and
   outlier loci. These results provide new insights into the morphological
   divergence and genetic basis of adaptation to differentiated habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The physiological link between oxygen availability and mitochondrial
   function is well established. However, whether or not fitness variation
   is associated with mitochondrial genotypes in the field remains a
   contested topic in evolutionary biology. In this study, we draw on a
   population of the teleost fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, where
   functionally distinct subspecies hybridize, likely as a result of past
   glacial events. We had two specific aims: (i) to determine the effect of
   mtDNA genotype on survivorship of male and female fish under hypoxic
   stress and (ii) to determine the effect of hypoxic stress, sex and mtDNA
   genotype on gene expression. We found an unexpected and highly
   significant effect of sex on survivorship under hypoxic conditions, but
   no significant effect of mtDNA genotype. Gene expression analyses
   revealed hundreds of transcripts differentially regulated by sex and
   hypoxia. Mitochondrial transcripts and other predicted pathways were
   among those influenced by hypoxic stress, and a transcript corresponding
   to the mtDNA control region was the most highly suppressed transcript
   under the conditions of hypoxia. An RT-PCR experiment on the control
   region was consistent with microarray results. Effects of mtDNA sequence
   variation on genome expression were limited; however, a potentially
   important epistasis between mtDNA sequence and expression of a
   nuclear-encoded mitochondrial translation protein was discovered.
   Overall, these results confirm that mitochondrial regulation is a major
   component of hypoxia tolerance and further suggest that purifying
   selection has been the predominant selective force on mitochondrial
   genomes in these two subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Expanding global trade and the domestication of ecosystems have greatly
   accelerated the rate of emerging infectious fungal diseases, and
   host-shift speciation appears to be a major route for disease emergence.
   There is therefore an increased interest in identifying the factors that
   drive the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations
   adapting to different hosts. Here, we used genetic markers and
   cross-inoculations to assess the level of gene flow and investigate
   barriers responsible for reproductive isolation between two sympatric
   populations of Venturia inaequalis, the fungal pathogen causing apple
   scab disease, one of the fungal populations causing a recent emerging
   disease on resistant varieties. Our results showed the maintenance over
   several years of strong and stable differentiation between the two
   populations in the same orchards, suggesting ongoing ecological
   divergence following a host shift. We identified strong selection
   against immigrants (i.e. host specificity) from different host varieties
   as the strongest and likely most efficient barrier to gene flow between
   local and emerging populations. Cross-variety disease transmission
   events were indeed rare in the field and cross-inoculation tests
   confirmed high host specificity. Because the fungus mates within its
   host after successful infection and because pathogenicity-related loci
   prevent infection of nonhost trees, adaptation to specific hosts may
   alone maintain both genetic differentiation between and adaptive allelic
   combinations within sympatric populations parasitizing different apple
   varieties, thus acting as a `magic trait'. Additional intrinsic and
   extrinsic postzygotic barriers might complete reproductive isolation and
   explain why the rare migrants and F1 hybrids detected do not lead to
   pervasive gene flow across years.}},

Abstract = {{South-East Asia is one of the world's richest regions in terms of
   biodiversity. An understanding of the distribution of diversity and the
   factors shaping it is lacking, yet essential for identifying
   conservation priorities for the region's highly threatened biodiversity.
   Here, we take a large-scale comparative approach, combining data from
   nine forest-associated Anopheles mosquito species and using statistical
   phylogeographical methods to disentangle the effects of environmental
   history, species-specific ecology and random coalescent effects.
   Spatially explicit modelling of Pleistocene demographic history supports
   a common influence of environmental events in shaping the genetic
   diversity of all species examined, despite differences in species' mtDNA
   gene trees. Populations were periodically restricted to allopatric
   northeastern and northwestern refugia, most likely due to Pleistocene
   forest fragmentation. Subsequent southwards post-glacial recolonization
   is supported by a north-south gradient of decreasing genetic diversity.
   Repeated allopatric fragmentation and recolonization have led to the
   formation of deeply divergent geographical lineages within four species
   and a suture zone where these intraspecific lineages meet along the
   Thai-Myanmar border. A common environmental influence for this
   divergence was further indicated by strong support for simultaneous
   divergence within the same four species, dating to approximately 900
   thousand years ago (kya). Differences in the geographical structuring of
   genetic diversity between species are probably the result of varying
   species' biology. The findings have important implications for
   conservation planning; if the refugial regions and suture zone
   identified here are shared by other forest taxa, the unique and high
   levels of genetic diversity they house will make these areas
   conservation priorities.}},

Abstract = {{Andean uplift contributed importantly to the build-up of high
   Neotropical diversity. Final uplift of the Eastern Cordillera of
   Colombia separated once-contiguous lowland faunas east and west of the
   Andes between 5 and 3.5 million years ago (Ma hereafter). We used DNA
   sequences from several moderate-to fast-evolving mitochondrial and two
   slow-evolving nuclear genes to generate a well-supported phylogeny of
   Dendrocincla woodcreepers, a genus with multiple species endemic to
   lowland regions both east and west of the Andes. A time-calibrated
   phylogeny and dispersal-vicariance analysis indicated that uplift of the
   Eastern Cordillera of Colombia resulted in the initial vicariant
   separation of a widespread lowland form east and west of the Andes at c.
   3.6 Ma. This was followed by two separate east-to-west dispersal events
   over or around the completed Andes, each producing a genetically
   distinct lineage. Our analysis suggests that Andean uplift promoted the
   build-up of biodiversity in lowland Neotropical faunas both through

Abstract = {{The Andes are known to have influenced speciation patterns in many taxa,
   yet whether species diversification occurred simultaneously with their
   uplift or only after uplift was complete remains unknown. We examined
   both the phylogenetic pattern and dates of branching in Adelomyia
   hummingbirds in relation to Andean uplift to determine whether
   diversification coincides with the chronological phases of the uplift or
   with recent climatic fluctuations after Andean formation. Results
   suggest that the genus Adelomyia originated in the central Andes in the
   Miocene and was found to be comprised of six deeply divergent
   phylogroups dating between 3.5 and 6 Ma. The most basal splits in the
   tree, corresponding to the most southerly distributed of the six
   phylogroups, diverged in the late Miocene, whereas the northern
   phylogroups originated during the early-to-mid-Pliocene, when the
   northern Andes reached heights sufficient to support Adelomyia
   populations. Although we provide evidence for a southern origin for the
   group, the subsequent diversification of the northern phylogroups did
   not strictly follow the hypothesized south-to-north orogeny of the
   Andes. Further genetic structure within phylogroups may have resulted
   from Pleistocene climate fluctuations after the onset of the six
   lineages during the Mio-Pliocene. We explore the processes that promoted
   diversification in the Andes and suggest that in at least some groups,
   divergence was coupled to Andean orogeny.}},

Abstract = {{Rickettsia felis is a rickettsial pathogen primarily associated with the
   cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis. Although laboratory studies have
   confirmed that R. felis is maintained by transstadial and transovarial
   transmission in C. felis, distinct mechanisms of horizontal transmission
   of R. felis among cat fleas are undefined. Based on the inefficient
   vertical transmission of R. felis by cat fleas and the detection of R.
   felis in a variety of haematophagous arthropods, we hypothesize that R.
   felis is horizontally transmitted between cat fleas. Towards testing
   this hypothesis, flea transmission of R. felis via a bloodmeal was
   assessed weekly for 4 weeks. Rhodamine B was used to distinguish
   uninfected recipient and R. felis-infected donor fleas in a rickettsial
   horizontal transmission bioassay, and quantitative real-time PCR assay
   was used to measure transmission frequency; immunofluorescence assay
   also confirmed transmission. Female fleas acquired R. felis infection
   more readily than male fleas after feeding on a R. felis-infected
   bloodmeal for 24 h (69.3\% and 43.3\%, respectively) and both
   Rickettsia-uninfected recipient male and female fleas became infected
   with R. felis after cofeeding with R. felis-infected donor fleas
   (3.3-40.0\%). Distinct bioassays were developed to further determine
   that R. felis was transmitted from R. felis-infected to uninfected fleas
   during cofeeding and copulation. Vertical transmission of R. felis by
   infected fleas was not demonstrated in this study. The demonstration of
   horizontal transmission of R. felis between cat fleas has broad
   implications for the ecology of R. felis rickettsiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Whether as the ancient Egyptian crocodile-god Sobek, a terrifying
   predator of African waterways, or simply as a premium handbag leather,
   the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) has long held the fascination
   of mankind. Despite 200 years of study, however, uncertainty remains as
   to its taxonomy. While resolving such issues are key to understanding
   the origins and biogeography of the so-called true crocodiles of genus
   Crocodylus, given wide-spread ongoing range contraction, such issues are
   paramount for design of future conservation strategies. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Hekkala et al. (2011) apply analysis of modern,
   historic and ancient DNA (aDNA) to the questions, with far-reaching
   implications. First they demonstrate that, as currently described, the
   Nile crocodile is paraphyletic, with individuals from the east and
   western clades separated by a number of New World crocodile species. The
   consequences of this finding are as important for conservation efforts
   as for their impact on crocodile taxonomy. Furthermore, they strike at
   the heart of the long-standing debate over whether aDNA analysis of
   ancient Egyptian mummies is scientifically sound.}},

Abstract = {{The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an ancient icon of both
   cultural and scientific interest. The species is emblematic of the great
   civilizations of the Nile River valley and serves as a model for
   international wildlife conservation. Despite its familiarity, a
   centuries-long dispute over the taxonomic status of the Nile crocodile
   remains unresolved. This dispute not only confounds our understanding of
   the origins and biogeography of the `true crocodiles' of the crown genus
   Crocodylus, but also complicates conservation and management of this
   commercially valuable species. We have taken a total evidence approach
   involving phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, as
   well as karyotype analysis of chromosome number and structure, to assess
   the monophyletic status of the Nile crocodile. Samples were collected
   from throughout Africa, covering all major bioregions. We also utilized
   specimens from museum collections, including mummified crocodiles from
   the ancient Egyptian temples at Thebes and the Grottes de Samoun, to
   reconstruct the genetic profiles of extirpated populations. Our analyses
   reveal a cryptic evolutionary lineage within the Nile crocodile that
   elucidates the biogeographic history of the genus and clarifies
   long-standing arguments over the species' taxonomic identity and
   conservation status. An examination of crocodile mummy haplotypes
   indicates that the cryptic lineage corresponds to an earlier description
   of C. suchus and suggests that both African Crocodylus lineages
   historically inhabited the Nile River. Recent survey efforts indicate
   that C. suchus is declining or extirpated throughout much of its
   distribution. Without proper recognition of this cryptic species,
   current sustainable use-based management policies for the Nile crocodile
   may do more harm than good.}},

Abstract = {{The Ethiopian highlands - home to striking species diversity and

   substantially extend the known distribution of X. largeni, a species
   formerly known from highlands southeast of the Rift, but that also
   occurs to the northwest. In both species, analysis of mitochondrial DNA
   and 19 autosomal loci identifies significant population structure,
   suggests little or no recent migration across the Rift Valley, and
   provides divergence time estimates across the Rift of similar to 1-3.5
   million years. These results indicate that the Ethiopian Rift Valley is

Abstract = {{Disentangling the effects of natural environmental features and
   anthropogenic factors on the genetic structure of endangered populations
   is an important challenge for conservation biology. Here, we
   investigated the combined influences of major environmental features and
   stocking with non-native fish on the genetic structure and local
   adaptation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. We used 17
   microsatellite loci to genotype 975 individuals originating from 34
   French rivers. Bayesian analyses revealed a hierarchical genetic
   structure into five geographically distinct clusters. Coastal distance,
   geological substrate and river length were strong predictors of
   population structure. Gene flow was higher among rivers with similar
   geologies, suggesting local adaptation to geological substrate. The
   effect of river length was mainly owing to one highly differentiated
   population that has the farthest spawning grounds off the river mouth
   (up to 900 km) and the largest fish, suggesting local adaptation to
   river length. We detected high levels of admixture in stocked
   populations but also in neighbouring ones, implying large-scale impacts
   of stocking through dispersal of non-native individuals. However, we
   found relatively few admixed individuals suggesting a lower fitness of
   stocked fish and/or some reproductive isolation between wild and stocked
   individuals. When excluding stocked populations, genetic structure
   increased as did its correlation with environmental factors. This study
   overall indicates that geological substrate and river length are major
   environmental factors influencing gene flow and potential local
   adaptation among Atlantic salmon populations but that stocking with
   non-native individuals may ultimately disrupt these natural patterns of
   gene flow among locally adapted populations.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroductions are commonly employed to preserve intraspecific
   biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. However, reintroduced populations
   are frequently smaller and more geographically isolated than native
   populations. Mixing genetically, divergent sources are often proposed to
   attenuate potentially low genetic diversity in reintroduced populations
   that may result from small effective population sizes. However, a
   possible negative tradeoff for mixing sources is outbreeding depression
   in hybrid offspring. We examined the consequences of mixed-source
   reintroductions on several fitness surrogates at nine slimy sculpin
   (Cottus cognatus) reintroduction sites in south-east Minnesota. We
   inferred the relative fitness of each crosstype in the reintroduced
   populations by comparing their growth rate, length, weight, body
   condition and persistence in reintroduced populations. Pure strain
   descendents from a single source population persisted in a greater
   proportion than expected in the reintroduced populations, whereas all
   other crosstypes occurred in a lesser proportion. Length, weight and
   growth rate were lower for second-generation intra-population hybrid
   descendents than for pure strain and first-generation hybrids. In the
   predominant pure strain, young-of the-year size was significantly
   greater than any other crosstype. Our results suggested that differences
   in fitness surrogates among crosstypes were consistent with disrupted
   co-adapted gene complexes associated with beneficial adaptations in
   these reintroduced populations. Future reintroductions may be improved
   by evaluating the potential for local adaptation in source populations
   or by avoiding the use of mixed sources by default when information on
   local adaptations or other genetic characteristics is lacking.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding a wider range of genotype-phenotype associations can be
   achieved through ecological and evolutionary studies of traditional
   laboratory models. Here, we conducted the first large-scale geographic
   analysis of genetic variation within and among wild zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) populations occurring in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, and we
   genetically compared wild populations to several commonly used lab
   strains. We examined genetic variation at 1832 polymorphic EST-based
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the cytb mitochondrial gene
   in 13 wild populations and three lab strains. Natural populations were
   subdivided into three major mitochondrial DNA clades with an average
   among-clade sequence divergence of 5.8\%. SNPs revealed five major
   evolutionarily and genetically distinct groups with an overall F-ST of
   0.170 (95\% CI 0.105-0.254). These genetic groups corresponded to
   discrete geographic regions and appear to reflect isolation in refugia
   during past climate cycles. We detected 71 significantly divergent
   outlier loci (3.4\%) and nine loci (0.5\%) with significantly low F-ST
   values. Valleys of reduced heterozygosity, consistent with selective
   sweeps, surrounded six of the 71 outliers (8.5\%). The lab strains
   formed two additional groups that were genetically distinct from all
   wild populations. An additional subset of outlier loci was consistent
   with domestication selection within lab strains. Substantial genetic
   variation that exists in zebrafish as a whole is missing from lab
   strains that we analysed. A combination of laboratory and field studies
   that incorporates genetic variation from divergent wild populations
   along with the wealth of molecular information available for this model
   organism provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of genetic
   influences on phenotypic variation for a vertebrate species.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern and intensity of pigmentation have direct impact on
   individual fitness through various ecological factors. In a Drosophila
   melanogaster population from southern Japan, thoracic trident
   pigmentation intensity of most of the strains could be classified into
   Dark or Light-type. The expression level variation of the ebony gene
   correlated well with this phenotype and the allelic differences in
   expression indicated that the variation is partly due to cis-regulatory
   changes. In the similar to 13 kb gene region, we identified 17
   nucleotide sites and 2 indels that were in complete association with the
   thoracic trident pigmentation intensity. Interestingly, 11 out of 19
   sites located within similar to 0.5 kb of the core epidermis enhancer.
   These sites had no obvious association with the abdominal pigmentation
   intensity in the previously analysed African populations from Uganda and
   Kenya, which suggested that multiple potential mutational pathways in
   the cis-regulatory control region of a single gene could lead to similar
   phenotypic variation within this species. We also found that the
   Light-type enhancer haplotype is strongly linked to a cosmopolitan
   inversion, In(3R)Payne, which is predominant in warmer climatic regions
   in both hemispheres. The sequence pattern suggested that the strong
   linkage may be due to selective forces related to thermal adaptation.
   The inferred selection for lighter pigmentation in the Japanese
   population is in the opposite direction of the previously reported case
   of selection for darker individuals in African populations.
   Nevertheless, both adaptive changes involved cis-regulatory changes of
   ebony, which shows that this gene is likely to be a common target of
   natural selection.}},

Abstract = {{Eighty years ago, Alexander Fleming described the antibiotic effects of
   a fungus that had contaminated his bacterial culture, kick starting the
   antimicrobial revolution. The fungus was later ascribed to a putatively
   globally distributed asexual species, Penicillium chrysogenum. Recently,
   the species has been shown to be genetically diverse, and possess
   mating-type genes. Here, phylogenetic and population genetic analyses
   show that this apparently ubiquitous fungus is actually composed of at
   least two genetically distinct species with only slight differences
   detected in physiology. We found each species in air and dust samples
   collected in and around St Mary's Hospital where Fleming worked.
   Genotyping of 30 markers across the genome showed that preserved fungal
   material from Fleming's laboratory was nearly identical to derived
   strains currently in culture collections and in the same distinct
   species as a wild progenitor strain of current penicillin producing
   industrial strains rather than the type species P. chrysogenum. Global
   samples of the two most common species were found to possess mating-type
   genes in a near 1:1 ratio, and show evidence of recombination with
   little geographic population subdivision evident. However, no
   hybridization was detected between the species despite an estimated time
   of divergence of less than 1 MYA. Growth studies showed significant
   interspecific inhibition by P. chrysogenum of the other common species,
   suggesting that competition may facilitate species maintenance despite
   globally overlapping distributions. Results highlight under-recognized
   diversity even among the best-known fungal groups and the potential for
   speciation despite overlapping distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Long neglected by classic island biogeographical theory, speciation
   within and among islands is increasingly recognized as a major
   contributor to insular diversity. Although the factors responsible for
   island speciation remain poorly understood, this process appears
   critically dependent on geographical variation and speciation in
   allopatry or parapatry. Here, we investigate geographical variation and
   speciation in a complex of Hispaniolan trunk anoles (Anolis distichus),
   where populations with strikingly distinct dewlap colours and patterns
   correspond with deeply divergent mtDNA structure. Using a multilocus,
   population-level analysis, we investigate whether these phenotypically
   and mitochondrially distinct populations exhibit the type of nuclear
   differentiation expected among species or incipient species. Along a
   transect that extends across a recently recessed marine barrier, our
   results are consistent with the persistence of an abrupt phenotypic and
   mitochondrial transition following secondary contact, in spite of little
   or no evidence for a reduction in nuclear gene flow. Along a second
   transect extending across a steep environmental gradient, our phenotypic
   and microsatellite data suggest a sharp genetic break with little or no
   admixture, whereas mtDNA recovers a signature of extensive
   unidirectional introgression. Together, these results are consistent
   with previous studies of Lesser Antillean anoles, suggesting that
   allopatric divergence alone is insufficient for speciation, whereas
   reduced gene flow and partial reproductive isolation may accumulate in
   the presence of ecological gradients.}},

Abstract = {{The long history of the deliberate or accidental and human-mediated
   dispersal of flowering plants has led to the introduction of foreign
   genotypes of many species into areas of Europe hitherto occupied by
   potentially distinct native populations. Studies of the genetic and
   evolutionary consequences of such changes are handicapped by the
   difficulty of identifying the surviving native populations of many
   species in the absence of clear morphological differences. We
   investigated the relationship between putative native and introduced
   populations of the herbaceous perennial Meconopsis cambrica
   (Papaveraceae), as the isolated native populations of this species can
   be identified by historical and ecological evidence. In Britain, the
   species is scarce and declining as a native, but has become increasingly
   frequent in recent decades as a garden escape. Native populations from
   Spain and France were compared with native and introduced British
   populations using internal transcribed spacer and cpDNA sequences and
   amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Ten of the twelve
   British populations could be unambiguously assigned to native or
   introduced groups using cpDNA and AFLPs. The introduced plants appear to
   originate from the central and eastern Pyrenees rather than from native
   British sites. Two populations (including one previously considered
   native) cannot be classified unambiguously. There is unequivocal
   evidence for unidirectional gene flow from native plants into two of the
   introduced populations and possible evidence for hybridization in three
   other sites (two native). The absence of biological barriers to
   hybridization suggests that the native and introduced gene pools of M.
   cambrica in Britain might eventually merge.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptic species have been increasingly revealed in the marine realm
   through an analytical approach incorporating multiple lines of evidence
   (e. g., mtDNA, nuclear genes and morphology). Illustrations of cryptic
   taxa improve our understanding of species diversity and evolutionary
   histories within marine animals. The pen shell Atrina pectinata is known
   to exhibit extensive morphological variations that may harbour cryptic
   diversity. In this study, we investigated A. pectinata populations along
   the coast of China and one from Japan to explore possible cryptic
   diversity and hybridization using a combination of mitochondrial
   (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, mtCOI) and nuclear (ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer, nrITS) genes as well as morphology. Phylogenetic
   analyses of mtCOI `DNA barcoding gene' sequences resolved six divergent
   lineages with intralineage divergences between 0.4\% and 0.8\%.
   Interlineage sequence differences ranged from 4.3\% to 22.0\%,
   suggesting that six candidate cryptic species are present. The nrITS
   gene revealed five deep lineages with Kimura 2-parameter distances of
   3.7-30.3\%. The five nuclear lineages generally corresponded to mtCOI
   lineages 1-4 and (5 + 6), suggestive of five distinct evolutionary
   lineages. Multiple nrITS sequences of significant variance were found
   within an individual, clearly implying recent hybridization events
   between/among the evolutionary lineages, which contributed to
   cytonuclear discordance. Morphologically, five morphotypes matched the
   five genetic lineages, although the intermediates may well blur the
   boundaries of different morphotypes. This study demonstrates the
   importance of combining multiple lines of evidence to explore species
   cryptic diversity and past evolutionary histories.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental processes govern demography, species movements, community
   turnover and diversification and yet in many respects these dynamics are
   still poorly understood at high latitudes. We investigate the combined
   effects of climate change and geography through time for a widespread
   Holarctic shrew, Sorex tundrensis. We include a comprehensive suite of
   closely related outgroup taxa and three independent loci to explore
   phylogeographic structure and historical demography. We then explore the
   implications of these findings for other members of boreal communities.
   The tundra shrew and its sister species, the Tien Shan shrew (Sorex
   asper), exhibit strong geographic population structure across Siberia
   and into Beringia illustrating local centres of endemism that correspond
   to Late Pleistocene refugia. Ecological niche predictions for both
   current and historical distributions indicate a model of persistence
   through time despite dramatic climate change. Species tree estimation
   under a coalescent process suggests that isolation between populations
   has been maintained across timeframes deeper than the periodicity of
   Pleistocene glacial cycling. That some species such as the tundra shrew
   have a history of persistence largely independent of changing climate,
   whereas other boreal species shifted their ranges in response to climate
   change, highlights the dynamic processes of community assembly at high
   latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Lineage, or true `species', trees may differ from gene trees because of
   stochastic processes in molecular evolution leading to gene-tree
   heterogeneity. Problems with inferring species trees because of
   excessive incomplete lineage sorting may be exacerbated in lineages with
   rapid diversification or recent divergences necessitating the use of
   multiple loci and individuals. Many recent multilocus studies that
   investigate divergence times identify lineage splitting to be more
   recent than single-locus studies, forcing the revision of biogeographic
   scenarios driving divergence. Here, we use 21 nuclear loci from regional
   populations to re-evaluate hypotheses identified in an mtDNA
   phylogeographic study of the Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), as well
   as identify processes driving divergence. Nuclear phylogeographic
   analyses identified hierarchical genetic structure, supporting a basal
   split at approximately 32 degrees N latitude, splitting northern and
   southern populations, with mixed patterns of genealogical concordance
   and discordance between data sets within the major lineages.
   Coalescent-based analyses identify isolation, with little to no gene
   flow, as the primary driver of divergence between lineages. Recent
   isolation appears to have caused genetic bottlenecks in populations in
   the Sierra Madre Oriental and coastal mountain ranges of California,
   which may be targets for conservation concerns.}},

Title = {{Negative heterozygosity-fitness correlations observed with
   microsatellites located in functional areas of the genome}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide heterozygosity inferred from neutral markers such as
   microsatellites is often expected to (i) reflect individual inbreeding
   and (ii) covary positively with fitness, generating positive
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). The often forgotten other
   end of the inbreeding-outbreeding continuum is outbreeding depression:
   past a certain degree of heterozygosity, heterozygotes tend to have
   lower fitness than homozygotes. Outbreeding depression arises from the
   breakup of co-adapted gene complexes and/or the introgression of
   nonlocally adapted genes. Provided that a correlation in heterozygosity
   exists across loci, outbreeding depression will be reflected in negative
   HFCs. In this issue, Olano-Marin et al. (2011a) describe negative
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) in blue tits Cyanistes
   caeruleus (Fig. 1), whereby heterozygosity has a significant, negative
   effect on female hatching success and recruitment. This study, together
   with a similar study by the same authors published in Evolution
   (Olano-Marin et al. 2011b), forms an original contribution in two
   respects. First, in the same population, positive and negative HFCs were
   recorded, revealing both inbreeding and outbreeding depression depending
   on the trait studied (whereby both processes were reliant on unknown,
   and possibly different, sets of coding loci). Second, a large number of
   microsatellite markers were split into two functional groups:
   microsatellite markers were either designed using zebra finch expressed
   sequence tags (ESTs) or derived using traditional cloning methods and
   presumed to be neutral. Contrasting large classes of loci and their
   varying levels of polymorphism, rather than looking for one locus that
   would stand out among tens of randomly selected markers, pave the way
   for a more elegant and powerful approach to explore how HFCs vary across
   traits and among regions of the genome.}},

Title = {{The full path of Janzen-Connell effects: genetic tracking of seeds to
   adult plant recruitment}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3953-3955}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Janzen-Connell (J-C) model (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971) has been a
   dominant yet controversial paradigm for forest community dynamics for
   four decades, especially in the tropics. With increasing distance from
   the parent plant, the density of dispersed seeds decreases and, because
   of a reduced impact of distance-and density-responsive seed and seedling
   enemies, propagule survival increases, resulting in peak recruitment at
   some distance from the parent and little recruitment near adult
   conspecifics. This spacing generates gaps near adult trees for the
   recruitment of heterospecifics, enhancing species coexistence and
   species richness. Field studies, primarily focused on seeds and young
   seedlings, have repeatedly demonstrated increasing survival with
   increasing distance from parents or decreasing density of propagules (e.
   g. Clark \& Clark 1984; Gilbert et al. 1994; Swamy \& Terborgh 2010).
   Yet a meta-analysis of distance-dependent propagule survival failed to
   support a general pattern of survival increasing with distance from
   adult conspecifics, suggesting that there is no need for further
   experimental tests of the J-C hypothesis in terms of diversity
   enhancement-results are species-specific, not general (Hyatt et al.
   2003). However, a lack of consistent experimental results is not
   surprising. The outcome of tests of the hypothesis can vary as a
   function of many factors that can affect successive recruitment stages
   differently (Schupp 1992; Hyatt et al. 2003; Swamy \& Terborgh 2010).
   This highlights a critical gap-a full test of the J-C model requires
   data demonstrating that effects carry over to recruitment of new
   reproductive adults, yet few studies have gone beyond early stages.
   There is strong inferential evidence that adult trees can show the
   imprint of J-C effects (e. g. Nathan et al. 2000; Howe \& Miriti 2004),
   and focal individual modelling has clearly demonstrated that J-C effects
   can operate from sapling through adult stages in a significant number of
   species (Peters 2003). It is likely that such results are not unusual,
   but there have been few attempts to demonstrate J-C spacing at the adult
   stage. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Steinitz et al. (2011)
   studied the Mediterranean pine Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) and
   combined a unique situation with an innovative approach to provide the
   most elegant demonstration yet that adult recruits are spaced further
   from parents than expected from the initial seed distribution, clear
   evidence of a J-C effect carrying over to reproductive adults. A major
   advancement of this study is that it incorporates estimates of the
   initial patterns of seed dispersal and parentage analysis of
   adult-offspring relationships, illustrating the value of combined field
   and genetic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed a representative collection of New World sweet potato
   landraces (329 accessions from Mexico to Peru) with both chloroplast and
   nuclear microsatellite markers. Both kinds of markers supported the
   existence of two geographically restricted genepools, corresponding to
   accessions from the north-western part of South America and accessions
   from the Caribbean and Central America region. Our conservative cpSSRs
   markers revealed that the divergence between the two haplotype groups is
   associated with numerous mutation events concerning various markers,
   supporting the idea that this divergence may be ancient, predating
   domestication. For both kinds of markers, we found no significant
   difference in diversity between the two genepools and detected
   region-specific alleles in both groups. Previous studies have favoured
   the hypothesis of a single domestication of this crop. Our analysis
   suggests at least two independent domestications, in Central/Caribbean
   America and in the north-western part of South America. Sweet potato was
   then dispersed from these centres throughout tropical America.
   Comparison of nuclear and chloroplast data suggests that exchanges of
   clones and sexual reproduction were both important processes in landrace
   diversification in this clonally propagated crop. Our analysis provides
   useful tools for rationalizing the conservation and use of sweet potato
   germplasm collections.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of dispersal-related gene flow is important for addressing
   many basic and applied questions in ecology and evolution. We used
   landscape genetics to understand the recovery of a recently expanded
   population of fishers (Martes pennanti) in Ontario, Canada. An important
   focus of landscape genetics is modelling the effects of landscape
   features on gene flow. Most often resistance surfaces in landscape
   genetic studies are built a priori based upon nongenetic field data or
   expert opinion. The resistance surface that best fits genetic data is
   then selected and interpreted. Given inherent biases in using expert
   opinion or movement data to model gene flow, we sought an alternative
   approach. We used estimates of conditional genetic distance derived from
   a network of genetic connectivity to parameterize landscape resistance
   and build a final resistance surface based upon information-theoretic
   model selection and multi-model averaging. We sampled 657 fishers from
   31 landscapes, genotyped them at 16 microsatellite loci, and modelled
   the effects of snow depth, road density, river density, and coniferous
   forest on gene flow. Our final model suggested that road density, river
   density, and snow depth impeded gene flow during the fisher population
   expansion demonstrating that both human impacts and seasonal habitat
   variation affect gene flow for fishers. Our approach to building
   landscape genetic resistance surfaces mitigates many of the problems and
   caveats associated with using either nongenetic field data or expert
   opinion to derive resistance surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging Bayesian analytical approaches offer increasingly sophisticated

   gazella, a species subjected to one of the most extreme examples of
   uncontrolled exploitation in history when it was reduced to the brink of
   extinction by the sealing industry during the late eighteenth and
   nineteenth centuries. Classical bottleneck tests, which exploit the fact
   that rare alleles are rapidly lost during demographic reduction, yielded
   ambiguous results. In contrast, a strong signal of recent demographic
   decline was detected using both Bayesian skyline plots and Approximate
   Bayesian Computation, the latter also allowing derivation of posterior
   parameter estimates that were remarkably consistent with historical
   observations. This was achieved using only contemporary samples, further
   emphasizing the potential of Bayesian approaches to address important
   problems in conservation and evolutionary biology.}},

Abstract = {{While the genetic structure of many tree species in temperate, American
   and Asian regions is largely explained by climatic oscillations and
   subsequent habitat contractions and expansions, little is known about
   Africa. We investigated the genetic diversity and structure of shea tree
   (Vitellaria paradoxa,) in Western Africa, an economically important tree
   species in the Sudano-Sahelian zone. Eleven nuclear microsatellites
   (nuc) were used to genotype 673 trees selected in 38 populations. They
   revealed moderate to high within-population diversity: allelic richness
   ranged from R-nuc = 3.99 to 5.63. This diversity was evenly distributed
   across West Africa. Populations were weakly differentiated (F-STnuc =
   0.085; P < 0.0001) and a pattern of isolation by distance was noted. No
   phylogeographic signal could be detected across the studied sample.
   Additionally, two chloroplast microsatellite loci, leading to 11
   chlorotypes, were used to analyse a sub-set of 370 individuals. Some
   variation in chloroplast allelic richness among populations could be
   detected (R-cp = 0.00 to 4.36), but these differences were not
   significant. No trend with latitude and longitude were observed.
   Differentiation was marked (G(STcp) = 0.553; P < 0.0001), but without a
   significant phylogeographical signal. Population expansion was detected
   considering the total population using approximate Bayesian computation
   (nuclear microsatellites) and mismatch distribution (chloroplast
   microsatellites) methods. This expansion signal and the isolation by
   distance pattern could be linked to the past climatic conditions in West
   Africa during the Pleistocene and Holocene which should have been
   favourable to shea tree development. In addition, human activities
   through agroforestry and domestication (started 10 000 BP) have probably
   enhanced gene flow and population expansion.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between genetic diversity and fitness has important
   implications in evolutionary and conservation biology. This relationship
   has been widely investigated at the individual level in studies of
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFC). General effects caused by
   inbreeding and/or local effects at single loci have been used as
   explanations of HFC, but the debate about the causes of HFC in open,
   natural populations is still ongoing. Study designs that control for
   variation in the inbreeding level of the individuals, and knowledge on
   the function and location of the markers used to measure heterozygosity,
   are fundamental to understand the causes of HFC. Here we investigated
   correlations between individual heterozygosity and estimates of survival
   at different life-history stages in an open population of blue tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus). For survival at the embryo, nestling and
   fledgling stage, we used a full-sibling approach, i.e. we controlled for
   the level of inbreeding. We genotyped 1496 individuals with 79
   microsatellites mapped across 25 chromosomes in the zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata) that were classified either as potentially
   functional (58 loci) or as neutral (21 loci). We found different effects
   of standardized multilocus heterozygosity (SH): SHfunctional had a
   negative effect on the probability of hatching and local recruitment of
   females, whereas SHneutral had a positive effect on adult survival. The
   negative effects of functional loci are better explained by local
   effects, whereas the positive effects of neutral markers could reflect
   inbreeding effects in the population. Our results highlight the
   importance of considering the characteristics of the markers used in HFC
   studies and confirm the mixed effects of heterozygosity in different
   contexts (e.g. sex and life-history stage).}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory predicts the evolution of trait combinations that
   enhance fitness, and the occurrence of trade-offs depends in part on the
   magnitude of variation in growth rate or acquisition. Using recombinant
   inbred lines, we examined the genetic architecture of age and size at
   reproduction across abiotic conditions encountered by cultivars and
   naturalized populations of Brassica rapa. We found that genotypes are
   plastic to seasonal setting, such that reproduction was accelerated
   under conditions encountered by summer annual populations and genetic
   variances for age at reproduction varied across simulated seasonal
   settings. Using an acquisition-allocation model, we predicted the
   likelihood of trade-offs. Consistent with predicted relationships, we
   observed a trade-off where early maturity is associated with small size
   at maturity under simulated summer and fall annual conditions but not
   under winter annual conditions. The trade-off in the summer annual
   setting was observed despite significant genotypic variation in growth
   rate, which is often expected to decouple age and size at reproduction
   because rapidly growing genotypes could mature early and attain a larger
   size relative to slowly growing genotypes that mature later. The absence
   of a trade-off in the winter setting is presumably attributable to the
   absence of genotypic differences in age at reproduction. We observed QTL
   for age at reproduction that jointly regulated size at reproduction in
   both the summer and fall annual settings, but these QTL were
   environment-specific (i.e. different QTL contributed to the trade-off in
   the fall vs. summer annual settings). Thus, at least some of the genetic
   mechanisms underlying observed trade-offs differed across environments.}},

   their natal rivers and streams. However, the key components of the
   molecular pathway involved in imprinting and homing are still unknown.
   If odorants are involved in salmon homing migration, then olfactory
   receptors should play a critical role in the dissipation of information
   from the environment to the fish. Therefore, we examined the expression
   profiles of a suite of genes encoding olfactory receptors and other
   olfactory-related genes in the olfactory rosettes of different life
   stages in two anadromous and one non-anadromous wild Atlantic salmon
   populations from Newfoundland, Canada. We identified seven
   differentially expressed OlfC genes in juvenile anadromous salmon
   compared to returning adults in both populations of anadromous Atlantic
   salmon. The salmon from the Campbellton River had an additional 10 genes
   that were differentially expressed in juveniles compared to returning
   adults. There was no statistically significant difference in gene
   expression of any of the genes in the non-anadromous population (P <
   0.01). The function of the OlfC gene products is not clear, but they are
   predicted to be amino acid receptors. Other studies have suggested that
   salmon use amino acids for imprinting and homing. This study, the first
   to examine the expression of olfactory-related genes in wild North
   American Atlantic salmon, has identified seven OlfC genes that may be
   involved in the imprinting and homeward migration of anadromous Atlantic
   salmon.}},

Abstract = {{A defining feature of social insects is the reproductive division of
   labour, in which workers usually forego all reproduction to help their
   mother queen to reproduce. However, little is known about the molecular
   basis of this spectacular form of altruism. Here, we compared gene
   expression patterns between nonreproductive, altruistic workers and
   reproductive, non-altruistic workers in queenless honeybee colonies
   using a whole-genome microarray analysis. Our results demonstrate
   massive differences in gene expression patterns between these two sets
   of workers, with a total of 1292 genes being differentially expressed.
   In nonreproductive workers, genes associated with energy metabolism and
   respiration, flight and foraging behaviour, detection of visible light,
   flight and heart muscle contraction and synaptic transmission were
   overexpressed relative to reproductive workers. This implies they
   probably had a higher whole-body energy metabolism and activity rate and
   were most likely actively foraging, whereas same-aged reproductive
   workers were not. This pattern is predicted from evolutionary theory,
   given that reproductive workers should be less willing to compromise
   their reproductive futures by carrying out high-risk tasks such as
   foraging or other energetically expensive tasks. By contrast,
   reproductive workers mainly overexpressed oogenesis-related genes
   compared to nonreproductive ones. With respect to key switches for ovary
   activation, several genes involved in steroid biosynthesis were
   upregulated in reproductive workers, as well as genes known to respond
   to queen and brood pheromones, genes involved in TOR and insulin
   signalling pathways and genes located within quantitative trait loci
   associated with reproductive capacity in honeybees. Overall, our results
   provide unique insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying
   alternative reproductive phenotypes in honeybee workers.}},

Abstract = {{Because domesticated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains have been used to
   produce fermented food and beverages for centuries without apparent
   health implications, S. cerevisiae has always been considered a
   Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) microorganism. However, the number
   of reported mucosal and systemic S. cerevisiae infections in the human
   population has increased and fatal infections have occurred even in
   relatively healthy individuals. In order to gain insight into the
   pathogenesis of S. cerevisiae and improve our understanding of the
   emergence of fungal pathogens, we performed a population-based
   genome-wide environmental association analysis of clinical vs.
   nonclinical origin in S. cerevisiae. Using tiling array-based,
   high-density genotypes of 44 clinical and 44 nonclinical S. cerevisiae
   strains from diverse geographical origins and source substrates, we
   identified several genetic loci associated with clinical background in
   S. cerevisiae. Associated polymorphisms within the coding sequences of
   VRP1, KIC1, SBE22 and PDR5, and the 5' upstream region of YGR146C
   indicate the importance of pseudohyphal formation, robust cell wall
   maintenance and cellular detoxification for S. cerevisiae pathogenesis,
   and constitute good candidates for follow-up verification of virulence

Abstract = {{Genetic variation among females is likely to influence the outcome of
   both pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Here we use association testing to survey natural
   variation in 10 candidate female genes for their effects on female
   reproduction. Females from 91 chromosome two substitution lines were
   scored for phenotypes affecting pre- and post-copulatory sexual
   selection such as mating and remating rate, propensity to use sperm from
   the second male to mate, and measures of fertility. There were
   significant genetic contributions to phenotypic variation for all the
   traits measured. Resequencing of the 10 candidate genes in the 91 lines
   yielded 68 non-synonymous polymorphisms which were tested for
   associations with the measured phenotypes. Twelve significant
   associations (markerwise P < 0.01) were identified. Polymorphisms in the
   putative serine protease homolog CG9897 and the putative odorant binding
   protein CG11797 associated with female propensity to remate and met an
   experimentwise significance of P < 0.05. Several other associations,
   including those impacting both fertility and female remating rate
   suggest that sperm storage might be an important factor mitigating
   female influence on sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{Co-divergence between host and parasites suggests that evolutionary
   processes act across similar spatial and temporal scales. Although there
   has been considerable work on the extent and correlates of co-divergence
   of RNA viruses and their mammalian hosts, relatively little is known
   about the extent to which virus evolution is determined by the
   phylogeographic history of host species. To test hypotheses related to
   co-divergence across a variety of spatial and temporal scales, we
   explored phylogenetic signatures in Andes virus (ANDV) sampled from
   Chile and its host rodent, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. ANDV showed
   strong spatial subdivision, a phylogeographic pattern also recovered in
   the host using both spatial and genealogical approaches, and despite
   incomplete lineage sorting. Lineage structure in the virus seemed to be
   a response to current population dynamics in the host at the spatial
   scale of ecoregions. However, finer scale analyses revealed contrasting
   patterns of genetic structure across a latitudinal gradient. As
   predicted by their higher substitution rates, ANDV showed greater
   genealogical resolution than the rodent, with topological congruence
   influenced by the degree of lineage sorting within the host. However,
   despite these major differences in evolutionary dynamics, the geographic
   structure of host and virus converged across large spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary climatic oscillations have been considered decisive in
   shaping much of the phylogeographic structure around the Mediterranean
   Basin. Within this paradigm, peripheral islands are usually considered
   as the endpoints of the colonization processes. Here, we use nuclear and
   mitochondrial markers to investigate the phylogeography of the blue tit
   complex (blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, Canary blue tit C. teneriffae and
   azure tit C. cyanus), and assess the role of the Canary Islands for the
   geographic structuring of genetic variation. The Canary blue tit
   exhibits strong genetic differentiation within the Canary Islands and,
   in combination with other related continental species, provides an ideal
   model in which to examine recent differentiation within a closely
   related group of continental and oceanic island avian species. We
   analysed DNA sequences from 51 breeding populations and more than 400
   individuals in the blue tit complex. Discrepancies in the nuclear and
   mitochondrial gene trees provided evidence of a complex evolutionary
   process around the Mediterranean Basin. Coalescent analyses revealed
   gene flow between C. caeruleus and C. teneriffae suggesting a dynamic
   process with multiple phases of colonization and geographic overlapping
   ranges. Microsatellite data indicated strong genetic differentiation
   among the Canary Islands and between the Canary archipelago and the
   close continental areas, indicating limited contemporary gene flow.
   Diversification of the blue tit complex is estimated to have started
   during the early Pliocene (approximate to 5 Ma), coincident with the end
   of Messinian salinity crisis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the
   North African blue tit is derived from the Canary blue tits, a pattern
   is avian `back colonization' that contrasts with more traditionally held
   views of islands being sinks rather than sources.}},

Abstract = {{Matrotrophy, the provisioning of embryos between fertilization and
   birth, creates the potential for conflict between mothers and embryos
   over the level of maternal investment. This conflict is predicted to
   drive the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations with
   different mating systems. In this study, we examine whether
   density-driven mating system differences explain the patterns of
   asymmetric reproductive isolation observed in previous studies involving
   four populations of the matrotrophic least killifish, Heterandria
   formosa. Minimum sire number reconstructions suggested that two
   populations characterized by low densities had lower levels of
   concurrent multiple paternity than two populations characterized by high
   densities. However, low levels of genetic variation in the low-density
   populations greatly reduced our probability of detecting multiple mating
   in them. Once we took the lower level of genetic variation into account
   in our estimations, high levels of multiple paternity appeared the rule
   in all four populations. In the population where we had the greatest
   power of detecting multiple mating, we found that multiple paternity in
   H. formosa typically involves multiple sires contributing to offspring
   within the same brood instead of different fathers contributing to
   distinct, simultaneously provisioned broods. Paternity was often skewed
   towards one sire. Our results suggest that differences between H.
   formosa populations in the levels of multiple paternity are not
   sufficient to explain the reproductive isolation seen in previous
   studies. We suggest that other influences on maternal-foetal conflict
   may contribute to the pattern of reproductive isolation observed
   previously. Alternatively, the asymmetric reproductive isolation seen in
   previous studies might reflect the disruption of maternal-foetal
   coadaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Effective seed dispersal, combining both dispersal and postdispersal
   (establishment) processes, determines population dynamics and
   colonization ability in plants. According to the Janzen-Connell (JC)
   model, high mortality near the mother plant shifts the offspring
   establishment distribution farther away from the mother plant relative
   to the seed dispersal distribution. Yet, extending this prediction to
   the distribution of mature (reproductive) offspring remains a challenge
   for long-living plants. To address this challenge, we selected an
   isolated natural Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) population in Mt.
   Pithulim (Israel), which expanded from five ancestor trees in the
   beginning of the 20th century into similar to 2000 trees today. Using
   nine microsatellite markers, we assigned parents to trees established
   during the early stages of population expansion. To elucidate the effect
   of the distance from the mother plant on postdispersal survival, we
   compared the effective seed dispersal kernel, based on the distribution
   of mother-offspring distances, with the seed dispersal kernel, based on
   simulations of a mechanistic wind dispersal model. We found that the
   mode of the effective dispersal kernel is shifted farther away than the
   mode of the seed dispersal kernel, reflecting increased survival with
   increasing distance from the mother plant. The parentage analysis
   demonstrated a highly skewed reproductive success and a strong
   directionality in effective dispersal corresponding to the wind regime.
   We thus provide compelling evidence that JC effects act also on
   offspring that become reproductive and persist as adults for many
   decades, a key requirement in assessing the role of postdispersal
   processes in shaping population and community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Aphid species may exhibit different reproductive modes ranging from
   cyclical to obligate parthenogenesis. The distribution of life cycle
   variation in aphids is generally determined by ecological forces, mainly
   climate, because only sexually produced diapausing eggs can survive
   harsh winters or periods of absence of suitable host plants. Aphids are
   thus interesting models to investigate intrinsic and environmental
   factors shaping the competition among sexual and asexual lineages. We
   conducted a Europe-wide sampling of black bean aphids, Aphis fabae, and
   combined population genetic analyses based on microsatellite data with
   an experimental determination of life cycle strategies. Aphids were
   collected from broad beans (Vicia faba) as well as some Chenopodiaceae,
   but we detected no genetic differentiation between aphids from different
   host plants. Consistent with model predictions, life cycle variation was
   related to climate, with aphids from areas with cold winters investing
   more in sexual reproduction than aphids from areas with mild winters.
   Accordingly, only populations from mild areas exhibited a clear genetic
   signature of clonal reproduction. These differences arise despite
   substantial gene flow over large distances, which was evident from a
   very low geographic population structure and a lack of
   isolation-by-distance among 18 sites across distances of more than 1000
   km. There was virtually no genetic differentiation between aphids with
   different reproductive modes, suggesting that new asexual lineages are
   formed continuously. Indeed, a surprising number of A. fabae genotypes
   even from colder climates produced some parthenogenetic offspring under
   simulated winter conditions. From this we predict that a shift to
   predominantly asexual reproduction could take place rapidly under
   climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{Over 95\% of the currently cultivated cotton was domesticated from
   Gossypium hirsutum, which originated and diversified in Mexico.
   Demographic and genetic studies of this species at its centre of origin
   and diversification are lacking, although they are critical for cotton
   conservation and breeding. We investigated the actual and potential
   distribution of wild cotton populations, as well as the contribution of
   historical and recent gene flow in shaping cotton genetic diversity and
   structure. We evaluated historical gene flow using chloroplast
   microsatellites and recent gene flow through the assessment of transgene
   presence in wild cotton populations, exploiting the fact that
   genetically modified cotton has been planted in the North of Mexico
   since 1996. Assessment of geographic structure through Bayesian spatial
   analysis, BAPS and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP),
   suggests that G. hirsutum seems to conform to a metapopulation scheme,
   with eight distinct metapopulations. Despite evidence for long-distance
   gene flow, genetic variation among the metapopulations of G. hirsutum is
   high (He = 0.894 +/- 0.01). We identified 46 different haplotypes, 78\%
   of which are unique to a particular metapopulation, in contrast to a
   single haplotype detected in cotton cultivars. Recent gene flow was also
   detected (m = 66/270 = 0.24), with four out of eight metapopulations
   having transgenes. We discuss the implications of the data presented
   here with respect to the conservation and future breeding of cotton
   populations and genetic diversity at its centre of crop origin.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid speciation has long fascinated evolutionary biologists and laymen
   alike, presumably because it challenges our classical view of evolution
   as a `one-way street' leading to strictly tree-like patterns of ancestry
   and descent. Homoploid hybrid speciation (HHS) has been a particularly
   interesting puzzle, as it appears to occur extremely rapidly, perhaps
   within less than 50 generations (McCarthy et al. 1995; Buerkle et al.
   2000). Nevertheless, HHS may sometimes involve extended or repeated
   periods of recombination and gene exchange between populations subject
   to strong divergent natural selection (Buerkle \& Rieseberg 2008). Thus,
   HHS provides a highly interesting setting for understanding the drivers
   and tempo of adaptive divergence and speciation in the face of gene flow
   (Arnold 2006; Rieseberg \& Willis 2007; Nolte \& Tautz 2009). In the
   present issue of Molecular Ecology, Wang et al. (2011) explore a
   particularly challenging issue connected to HHS: they attempt to trace
   the colonization and recombination history of an ancient (several MYA)
   hybrid species, from admixture and recombination in the ancestral hybrid
   zone to subsequent range shifts triggered by tectonic events (uplift of
   the Tibetan plateau) and climatic shifts (Pleistocene ice ages). This
   work is important because it addresses key issues related to the origin
   of the standing genetic variation available for adaptive responses (e.g.
   to climate change) and speciation in temperate species, which are topics
   of great current interest (Rieseberg et al. 2003; Barrett \& Schluter
   2008; de Carvalho et al. 2010).}},

Abstract = {{Domestication of algae by lichen-forming fungi describes the symbiotic
   relationship between the photosynthetic (green alga or cyanobacterium;
   photobiont) and fungal (mycobiont) partnership in lichen associations
   (Goward 1992). The algal domestication implies that the mycobiont
   cultivates the alga as a monoculture within its thallus, analogous to a
   farmer cultivating a food crop. However, the initial photobiont
   `selection' by the mycobiont may be predetermined by the habitat rather
   than by the farmer. When the mycobiont selects a photobiont from the
   available photobionts within a habitat, the mycobiont may influence
   photobiont growth and reproduction (Ahmadjian \& Jacobs 1981) only after
   the interaction has been initiated. The theory of ecological guilds
   (Rikkinen et al. 2002) proposes that habitat limits the variety of
   photobionts available to the fungal partner. While some studies provide
   evidence to support the theory of ecological guilds in cyanobacterial
   lichens (Rikkinen et al. 2002), other studies propose models to explain
   variation in symbiont combinations in green algal lichens (Ohmura et al.
   2006; Piercey-Normore 2006; Yahr et al. 2006) hypothesizing the
   existence of such guilds. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Peksa \&
   S. kaloud (2011) test the theory of ecological guilds and suggest a
   relationship between algal habitat requirements and lichen adaptation in
   green algal lichens of the genus Lepraria. The environmental parameters
   examined in this study, exposure to rainfall, altitude and substratum
   type, are integral to lichen biology. Lichens have a poikilohydric
   nature, relying on the availability of atmospheric moisture for
   metabolic processes. Having no known active mechanism to preserve
   metabolic thallus moisture in times of drought, one would expect a
   strong influence of the environment on symbiont adaptation to specific
   habitats. Adaptation to changes in substrata and its properties would be
   expected with the intimate contact between crustose lichens in the genus
   Lepraria. Altitude has been suggested to influence species distributions
   in a wide range of taxonomic groups. This is one of the first studies to
   illustrate an ecological guild, mainly for exposure to rainfall
   (ombrophiles and ombrophobes), with green algal lichens.}},

Abstract = {{Linear and heterogeneous habitat makes headwater stream networks an
   ideal ecosystem in which to test the influence of environmental factors
   on spatial genetic patterns of obligatory aquatic species. We
   investigated fine-scale population structure and influence of stream
   habitat on individual-level genetic differentiation in brook trout
   (Salvelinus fontinalis) by genotyping eight microsatellite loci in 740
   individuals in two headwater channel networks (7.7 and 4.4 km) in
   Connecticut, USA. A weak but statistically significant
   isolation-by-distance pattern was common in both sites. In the field,
   many tagged individuals were recaptured in the same 50-m reaches within
   a single field season (summer to fall). One study site was characterized
   with a hierarchical population structure, where seasonal barriers
   (natural falls of 1.5-2.5 m in height during summer base-flow condition)
   greatly reduced gene flow and perceptible spatial patterns emerged
   because of the presence of tributaries, each with a group of genetically
   distinguishable individuals. Genetic differentiation increased when
   pairs of individuals were separated by high stream gradient (steep
   channel slope) or warm stream temperature in this site, although the
   evidence of their influence was equivocal. In a second site, evidence
   for genetic clusters was weak at best, but genetic differentiation
   between individuals was positively correlated with number of tributary
   confluences. We concluded that the population-level movement of brook
   trout was limited in the study headwater stream networks, resulting in
   the fine-scale population structure (genetic clusters and clines) even
   at distances of a few kilometres, and gene flow was mitigated by
   `riverscape' variables, particularly by physical barriers, waterway
   distance (i.e. isolation-by-distance) and the presence of tributaries.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of effective tools has hampered out ability to assess the size,
   growth and ages of clonal plants. With Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) as
   a model, we introduce a novel analytical framework that integrates DNA
   fingerprinting and mathematical modelling to simulate growth and
   estimate ages of clonal plants. We also demonstrate the application of
   such life-history information of clonal plants to provide insight into
   management plans. Serenoa is an ecologically important foundation
   species in many Southeastern United States ecosystems; yet, many land
   managers consider Serenoa a troublesome invasive plant. Accordingly,
   management plans have been developed to reduce or eliminate Serenoa with
   little understanding of its life history. Using Amplified Fragment
   Length Polymorphisms, we genotyped 263 Serenoa and 134 Sabal etonia (a
   sympatric non-clonal palmetto) samples collected from a 20 x 20 m study
   plot in Florida scrub. Sabal samples were used to assign small
   field-unidentifiable palmettos to Serenoa or Sabal and also as a
   negative control for clone detection. We then mathematically modelled
   clonal networks to estimate genet ages. Our results suggest that Serenoa
   predominantly propagate via vegetative sprouts and 10 000-year-old
   genets may be common, while showing no evidence of clone formation by
   Sabal. The results of this and our previous studies suggest that: (i)
   Serenoa has been part of scrub associations for thousands of years, (ii)
   Serenoa invasion are unlikely and (ii) once Serenoa is eliminated from
   local communities, its restoration will be difficult. Reevaluation of
   the current management tools and plans is an urgent task.}},

Title = {{The long and the short of it: SD1 polymorphism and the evolution of
   growth trait divergence in U.S. weedy rice}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3743-3756}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Growth-related traits, such as greater height, greater biomass, faster
   growth rate and early flowering, are thought to enhance competitiveness
   of agricultural weeds. However, weedy rice, a conspecific weed of
   cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), displays variation for growth traits.
   In the United States, separately evolved weedy rice groups have been
   shown to share genomic identity with exotic domesticated cultivars.
   Through a common garden experiment, we investigated whether growth trait
   divergence has occurred among U. S. weeds and their putative cultivated
   progenitors. We also determined polymorphism patterns in the growth
   candidate gene, SD1, to assess its possible role in the evolution of
   divergent phenotypes. We found considerable growth trait variation among
   weed groups, suggesting that growth trait convergence is not evident
   among weedy populations. Phenotypic divergence of weedy rice from
   cultivated ancestors is most apparent for flowering time. Introgression
   of a chromosomal block containing the SD1 allele from tropical japonica,
   the predominant U.S. rice cultivar, was detected in one weedy rice
   population and is associated with a change in growth patterns in this
   group. This study demonstrates the role of introgressive hybridization
   in evolutionary divergence of an important weed.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean bath sponge Spongia officinalis is an iconic species
   with high socioeconomic value and precarious future owing to unregulated
   harvesting, mortality incidents and lack of established knowledge
   regarding its ecology. This study aims to assess genetic diversity and
   population structure of the species at different geographical scales
   throughout its distribution. For this purpose, 11 locations in the
   Eastern Mediterranean (Aegean Sea), Western Mediterranean (Provence
   coast) and the Strait of Gibraltar were sampled; specimens were analysed
   using partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI)
   sequences, along with a set of eight microsatellite loci. According to
   our results (i) no genetic differentiation exists among the acknowledged
   Mediterranean morphotypes, and hence, S. officinalis can be viewed as a
   single, morphologically variable species; (ii) a notable divergence was
   recorded in the Gibraltar region, indicating the possible existence of a
   cryptic species; (iii) restriction to gene flow was evidenced between
   the Aegean Sea and Provence giving two well-defined regional clusters,
   thus suggesting the existence of a phylogeographic break between the two
   systems; (iv) low levels of genetic structure, not correlated to
   geographical distance, were observed inside geographical sectors,
   implying mechanisms (natural or anthropogenic) that enhance dispersal
   and gene flow have promoted population connectivity; (v) the genetic
   diversity of S. officinalis is maintained high in most studied locations
   despite pressure from harvesting and the influence of devastating
   epidemics. These findings provide a basis towards the effective
   conservation and management of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Rare plant species are vulnerable to genetic erosion and inbreeding
   associated with small population size and isolation due to increasing
   habitat fragmentation. The degree to which these problems undermine
   population viability remains debated. We explore genetic and
   reproductive processes in the critically endangered long-lived tropical
   tree Medusagyne oppositifolia, an endemic to the Seychelles with a
   naturally patchy distribution. This species is failing to recruit in
   three of its four populations. We evaluate whether recruitment failure
   is linked to genetic problems associated with fragmentation, and if
   genetic rescue can mitigate such problems. Medusagyne oppositifolia
   comprises 90 extant trees in four populations, with only the largest (78
   trees) having successful recruitment. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we
   demonstrated that genetic diversity is high (H-E: 0.48-0.63; H-O:
   0.56-0.78) in three populations, with only the smallest population
   having relatively low diversity (H-E: 0.26 and H-O: 0.30). All
   populations have unique alleles, high genetic differentiation, and
   significant within population structure. Pollen and seed dispersal
   distances were mostly less than 100 m. Individuals in small populations
   were more related than individuals in the large population, thus
   inbreeding might explain recruitment failure in small populations.
   Indeed, inter-population pollination crosses from the large donor
   population to a small recipient population resulted in higher
   reproductive success relative to within-population crosses. Our study
   highlights the importance of maintaining gene flow between populations
   even in species that have naturally patchy distributions. We demonstrate
   the potential for genetic and ecological rescue to support conservation
   of plant species with limited gene flow.}},

   continuously small female effective population size through time. We

Abstract = {{Pinus densata is an intriguingly successful homoploid hybrid species
   that occupies vast areas of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau in which
   neither of its parental species are present, but the colonization
   processes involved are poorly understood. To shed light on how this
   species colonized and became established on the plateau, we surveyed
   paternally inherited chloroplast (cp) and maternally inherited
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation within and among 54 populations of P.
   densata and its putative parental species throughout their respective
   ranges. Strong spatial genetic structure of both cp and mtDNA were
   detected in P. densata populations. Mitotypes specific to P. densata
   were likely generated by complex recombination events. A putative
   ancestral hybrid zone in the northeastern periphery of P. densata was
   identified, and we propose that the species then colonized the plateau
   by migrating westwards. Along the colonization route, consecutive
   bottlenecks and surfing of rare alleles caused a significant reduction
   in genetic diversity and strong population differentiation. The
   direction and intensity of introgression from parental species varied
   among geographic regions. In western parts of its range, the species
   seems to have been isolated from seed and pollen flow from its parent
   species for a long time. The observed spatial distribution of genetic
   diversity in P. densata also appears to reflect the persistence of this
   species on the plateau during the last glaciation. Our results indicate
   that both ancient and contemporary population dynamics have contributed
   to the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in P. densata, which
   accordingly reflects its evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{Homoploid hybrid speciation is thought to require unusual circumstances
   to yield reproductive isolation from the parental species, and few
   examples are known from nature. Here, we present genetic evidence for
   this mode of speciation in birds. Using Bayesian assignment analyses of
   751 individuals genotyped for 14 unlinked, nuclear microsatellite loci,
   we show that the phenotypically intermediate Italian sparrow (Passer
   italiae) does not form a cluster of its own, but instead exhibits clear
   admixture (over its entire breeding range) between its putative parental
   species, the house sparrow (P. domesticus) and the Spanish sparrow (P.
   hispaniolensis). Further, the Italian sparrow possesses mitochondrial
   (mt) DNA haplotypes identical to both putative parental species
   (although mostly of house sparrow type), indicating a recent hybrid
   origin. Today, the Italian sparrow has a largely allopatric distribution
   on the Italian peninsula and some Mediterranean islands separated from
   its suggested parental species by the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea,
   but co-occurs with the Spanish sparrow on the Gargano peninsula in
   southeast Italy. No evidence of interbreeding was found in this
   sympatric population. However, the Italian sparrow hybridizes with the
   house sparrow in a sparsely populated contact zone in the Alps. Yet, the
   contact zone is characterized by steep clines in species-specific male
   plumage traits, suggesting that partial reproductive isolation may also
   have developed between these two taxa. Thus, geographic and reproductive
   barriers restrict gene flow into the nascent hybrid species. We propose
   that an origin of hybrid species where the hybrid lineage gets
   geographically isolated from its parental species, as seems to have
   happened in this system, might be more common in nature than previously
   assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Homoploid hybrid speciation in animals is poorly understood, mainly
   because of the scarcity of well-documented cases. Here, we present the
   results of a multilocus sequence analysis on the house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus), Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and their proposed
   hybrid descendant, the Italian sparrow (P. italiae). The Italian sparrow
   is shown to be genetically intermediate between the house sparrow and
   Spanish sparrow, exhibiting genealogical discordance and a mosaic
   pattern of alleles derived from either of the putative parental species.
   The average variation on the Z chromosome was significantly reduced
   compared with autosomal variation in the putative parental species, the
   house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. Additionally, divergence between the
   two species was elevated on the Z chromosome relative to the autosomes.
   This pattern of variation and divergence is consistent with reduced
   introgression of Z-linked genes and/or a faster-Z effect (increased rate
   of adaptive divergence on the Z). F-ST-outlier tests were consistent
   with the faster-Z hypothesis: two of five Z-linked loci (CHD1Z and PLAA)
   were identified as candidates for being subject to positive, divergent
   selection in the putative parental species. Interestingly, the two
   latter genes showed a mosaic pattern in the (hybrid) Italian sparrow;
   that is, the Italian sparrow was found to be fixed for Spanish sparrow
   alleles at CHD1Z and to mainly have house sparrow alleles at PLAA.
   Preliminary evidence presented in this study thus suggests that sex
   chromosomes may play a significant role in this case of homoploid hybrid
   speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Species introductions are considered one of the major drivers of
   biodiversity loss via ecological interactions and genetic admixture with
   local fauna. We examined two well-recognized fish species, native
   whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and introduced vendace (Coregonus
   albula), as well as their morphological hybrids in a single lake to test
   for selection against hybrids and backcrosses in the wild. A
   representative random subsample of 693 individuals (27.8\%) was taken
   from the total catch of coregonids. This subsample was examined with the
   aim to select c. 50 individuals of pure whitefish (n = 52), pure vendace
   (n = 55) and putative hybrid (n = 19) for genetic analyses. The
   subsequent microsatellites and mitochondrial (mt) DNA analyses provided
   compelling evidence of hybridization and introgression. Of the 126 fish
   examined, four were found to be F-1, 14 backcrosses to whitefish and
   seven backcrosses to vendace. The estimates of historical gene flow
   suggested higher rates from introduced vendace into native whitefish
   than vice versa, whereas estimates of contemporary gene flow were equal.
   Mitochondrial introgression was skewed, with 18 backcrosses having
   vendace mtDNA and only three with whitefish mtDNA. Hybrids and
   backcrosses had intermediate morphology and niche utilization compared
   with parental species. No evidence of selection against hybrids or
   backcrosses was apparent, as both hybrid and backcross growth rates and
   fecundities were high. Hybrids (F-1) were only detected in 2
   year-classes, suggesting temporal variability in mating between vendace
   and whitefish. However, our data show that hybrids reached sexual
   maturity and reproduced actively, with backcrosses recorded from six
   consecutive year-classes, whereas no F-2 individuals were found. The
   results indicate widespread introgression, as 10.8\% of coregonids were
   estimated to be backcrosses.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene are hypothesized as one
   of the foremost contributors to biological diversification. This is
   especially true for cold-adapted montane species, where range shifts
   have had a pronounced effect on population-level divergence.
   Gartersnakes of the Thamnophis rufipunctatus species complex are
   restricted to cold headwater streams in the highlands of the Sierra
   Madre Occidental and southwestern USA. We used coalescent and multilocus
   phylogenetic approaches to test whether genetic diversification of this
   montane-restricted species complex is consistent with two prevailing
   models of range fluctuation for species affected by Pleistocene climate
   changes. Our concatenated nuDNA and multilocus species analyses
   recovered evidence for the persistence of multiple lineages that are
   restricted geographically, despite a mtDNA signature consistent with
   either more recent connectivity (and introgression) or recent expansion
   (and incomplete lineage sorting). Divergence times estimated using a
   relaxed molecular clock and fossil calibrations fall within the Late
   Pleistocene, and zero gene flow scenarios among current geographically
   isolated lineages could not be rejected. These results suggest that
   increased climate shifts in the Late Pleistocene have driven
   diversification and current range retraction patterns and that the
   differences between markers reflect the stochasticity of gene lineages
   (i.e. ancestral polymorphism) rather than gene flow and introgression.
   These results have important implications for the conservation of T.
   rufipunctatus (sensu novo), which is restricted to two drainage systems
   in the southwestern US and has undergone a recent and dramatic decline.}},

Abstract = {{We gathered mitochondrial DNA sequences (557 bp from the control region
   in 935 specimens and 668 bp of the cytochrome b gene in 139 specimens)
   of Pacific herring collected from 20 nearshore localities spanning the
   species' extensive range along the North Pacific coastlines of Asia and
   North America. Haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were high,
   and three major phylogeographic lineages (sequence divergences ca.
   1.5\%) were detected. Using a variety of phylogenetic methods,
   coalescent reasoning, and molecular dating interpreted in conjunction
   with paleoclimatic and physiographic evidence, we infer that the genetic
   make-up of extant populations of C. pallasii was shaped by Pleistocene
   environmental impacts on the historical demography of this species. A
   deep genealogical split that cleanly distinguishes populations in the
   western vs. eastern North Pacific probably originated as a vicariant
   separation associated with a glacial cycle that drove the species
   southward and isolated two ancestral populations in Asia and North
   America. Another deep genealogical split may have involved either a
   vicariant isolation of a third herring lineage (perhaps originally in
   the Gulf of California) or it may have resulted simply from the long
   coalescent times that are possible in large populations. Coalescent
   analyses showed that all the three evolutionary lineages of C. pallasii
   experienced major expansions in their most recent histories after having
   remained more stable in the preceding periods. Independent of the
   molecular calibration chosen, populations of C. pallasii appear to have
   remained stable or grown throughout the periods that covered at least
   two major glaciations, and probably more.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene glacial oscillations and associated tectonic processes are
   believed to have influenced the historical abundances and distribution
   of organisms in the Asia Northwest Pacific (ANP). Accumulating evidence
   indicates that factors shaping tempo-spatial population dynamics and
   distribution patterns of marine taxa vary with biogeographical latitude,
   pelagic behaviour and oceanographic regimes. To detect what kinds of
   historical and contemporary factors affected genetic connectivity,
   phylogeographic profiles of littoral macroalga Sargassum horneri in the
   ANP were analysed based on mitochondrial (Cox3) and chloroplast (rbcL)
   data sets. Five distinct clades were recovered. A strong signature of
   biogeographical structure was revealed (Phi(CT) = 0.487, P < 0.0001)
   derived from remarkable differentiation in clade distribution, as clade
   I is restricted to Chinese marginal seas (Yellow-Bohai Sea, East China
   Sea and South China Sea), whereas clades II-V are discontinuously
   scattered around the main Islands of Japan. Furthermore, two secondary
   contact regions were identified along the south Japan-Pacific coastline.
   This significant differentiation between the two basins may reflect
   historical glacial isolation in the northwestern Pacific, which is
   congruent with the estimates of clade divergence and demographic
   expansion during the late Quaternary low sea levels. Analysis of
   molecular variance and the population-pair statistic F-ST also revealed
   significant genetic structural differences between Chinese marginal seas
   and the Japanese basin. This exceptional phylogeographic architecture in
   S. horneri, initially shaped by historical geographic isolation during
   the late Pleistocene ice age and physical biogeographical barriers, can
   be complicated by oceanographic regimes (ocean surface currents) and
   relocating behaviour such as oceanic drifting.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between hosts and parasites represent complex co-evolving
   systems that can vary both temporally and spatially. This variation may
   result in different phylogeographic outcomes, ranging from highly
   geographically structured parasite populations comprised of specialist
   lineages that are locally abundant but have restricted global occupancy
   to geographically unstructured parasite populations consisting of
   widespread parasites. Here, we present results from a large
   biogeographic study of the Leucocytozoon blood parasites of two
   nonmigrant bird species, conducted at nine sites across Europe. The aim
   was to determine whether the parasite lineages of the two hosts were
   phylogeographically structured across Europe. Employing molecular
   methods, we found a large diversity of parasites, and although overall
   prevalence varied greatly, the parasites were not genetically
   structured. Several measures of local parasite abundance were associated
   with the number of sites that the lineage occurred in, which is
   consistent with the macroecological phenomenon of the
   abundance-occupancy relationship. Taken together, our results show that
   parasite dispersal is somewhat uncoupled to that of the host in this
   system: we suggest that broad host and/or vector preference may play an
   important role in determining the distribution of these parasites and in
   affecting host-parasite coevolution in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread species have the potential to reveal large-scale
   biogeographical patterns, as well as responses to environmental changes
   possibly unique to habitat generalists. This study presents a
   continental-scale phylogeographical analysis of Polyommatus icarus, one
   of the most common Palaearctic butterflies, and the morphologically and
   ecologically similar Polyommatus celina, a recently discovered cryptic
   species. By combining data from mitochondrial {[}cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI)] and nuclear {[}internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)]
   molecular markers with geometric morphometrics, we document a complex
   phylogeographical history for the two species. Despite morphological
   similarities, the genetic divergence between these two species is high
   (more than 5\% at COI) and they are not sister species. For the first
   time, we show that P. celina occurs not only in North Africa but also in
   Europe, where it inhabits several west Mediterranean islands, as well as
   large parts of Iberia, where it occurs in parapatry with P. icarus. The
   two species appear to completely exclude each other on islands, but we
   provide morphological and molecular evidence that introgression occurred
   in the Iberian Peninsula. We discovered strongly diverged lineages that
   seem to represent relict populations produced by past range expansions
   and contractions: Crete and Iberian isolates for P. icarus,
   Balearics-Sardinia and Sicily-Lipari for P. celina. This study shows
   that a combined genetic-morphometric approach can shed light on cryptic
   diversity while providing the necessary resolution to reconstruct a
   fine-scale phylogeographical history of species at both spatial and
   temporal levels.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution patterns of symbiotic algae are thought to be conferred
   mainly by their hosts, however, they may originate in algal
   environmental requirements as well. In lichens, predominantly
   terrestrial associations of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, the
   ecological preferences of photobionts have not been directly studied so
   far. Here, we examine the putative environmental requirements in
   lichenized alga Asterochloris, and search for the existence of
   ecological guilds in Asterochloris-associating lichens. Therefore, the
   presence of phylogenetic signal in several environmental traits was
   tested. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated set of internal
   transcribed spacer rDNA and actin type I intron sequences from
   photobionts associated with lichens of the genera Lepraria and
   Stereocaulon (Stereocaulaceae, Ascomycota) revealed 13 moderately to
   well-resolved clades. Photobionts from particular algal clades were
   found to be associated with taxonomically different, but ecologically
   similar lichens. The rain and sun exposure were the most significant
   environmental factor, clearly distinguishing the Asterochloris lineages.
   The photobionts from ombrophobic and ombrophilic lichens were clustered
   in completely distinct clades. Moreover, two photobiont taxa were
   obviously differentiated based on their substrate and climatic
   preferences. Our study, thus reveals that the photobiont, generally the
   subsidiary member of the symbiotic lichen association, could exhibit
   clear preferences for environmental factors. These algal preferences may
   limit the ecological niches available to lichens and lead to the
   existence of specific lichen guilds.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Aquilegia consists of 60-70 perennial plant species widely
   distributed throughout the northern hemisphere. Its flowers have a
   delicate and ornamental appearance that makes them a favourite of
   gardeners. In this genus, adaptive radiations for both floral and
   vegetative traits have occurred. These adaptive radiations, and the key
   phylogenetic placement of Aquilegia between Arabidopsis and rice, make
   this genus a `model system' for plant evolution (Kramer 2009). In this
   issue, Castellanos et al. (2011) use a marker-based method to infer
   heritability for floral and vegetative traits in two Aquilegia species.
   Layered on top of this are estimates of the strength of natural
   selection. This novel joint estimation of heritability and selection in
   the wild showed that vegetative traits, compared to floral traits, have
   the highest evolutionarily potential. Evolutionary potential is the most
   important quantity to measure in wild populations. It combines
   inheritance and strength of selection and predicts the potential for
   populations to adapt to changing environments. The combination of
   molecular techniques with species in natural environments makes this
   work a model for molecular ecological investigations.}},

Abstract = {{A huge variety of Arthropod species is infected with endosymbiotic
   Wolbachia bacteria that manipulate their host's reproduction to invade
   populations. In addition to vertical transmission from mother to
   offspring through the egg cytoplasm, it has been demonstrated through
   phylogenetic analyses and natural transfer experiments that horizontal
   transmission of Wolbachia (i.e. contagion) can occur between Arthropod
   hosts. More recently, factors influencing horizontal transfer have also
   been explored. While it is clear that horizontal transmission between
   species plays a major role in the evolutionary history of Wolbachia
   infections among insects, its role in the spread of a new infection
   through a host population, notably through within-species transfers,
   remained unknown. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Kraaijeveld et al.
   (2011) present the first evidence that horizontal transmission played a
   key role in the early spread of parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia
   through the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes. To support their
   finding, the authors studied genetic variation in three types of
   markers, including host nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA and Wolbachia
   DNA. Specifically, they examined potential associations between their
   diversity patterns. No diversity was detected in Wolbachia genes,
   indicating that a single Wolbachia strain must have infected and spread
   through L. clavipes. In addition, a correlation between substantial
   variation in mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes suggested that
   horizontal transmission played an important role in the current clonal
   genetic variation in this wasp. Such horizontal transmission could be
   facilitated by a specific host ecology (e. g. parasitoid wasps sharing
   the same host resource) and potentially impact co-evolution between host
   and symbiont.}},

Abstract = {{The first North American RAD Sequencing and Genomics Symposium,
   sponsored by Floragenex (http://www.floragenex.com/radmeeting/), took
   place in Portland, Oregon (USA) on 19 April 2011. This symposium was
   convened to promote and discuss the use of restriction-site-associated
   DNA (RAD) sequencing technologies. RAD sequencing is one of several
   strategies recently developed to increase the power of data generated
   via short-read sequencing technologies by reducing their complexity
   (Baird et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2009; Andolfatto et al. 2011; Elshire
   et al. 2011). RAD sequencing, as a form of genotyping by sequencing, has
   been effectively applied in genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) analyses in a range of organisms including nonmodel, genetically
   highly heterogeneous organisms (Table 1; Baird et al. 2008; Baxter et
   al. 2011; Chutimanitsakun et al. 2011; Pfender et al. 2011). RAD
   sequencing has recently found applications in phylogeography (Emerson et
   al. 2010) and population genomics (Hohenlohe et al. 2010). Considering
   the diversity of talks presented during this meeting, more developments
   are to be expected in the very near future.}},

Abstract = {{Species living in seasonal environments often adaptively time their

   expression of genes in the flowering-time regulatory network across wild
   populations of the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, that we found to

   clinal variation was associated with changes at multiple hierarchical
   levels in multiple pathways. Paralogue-specific changes in FT homologue
   expression and tissue-specific changes in SOC1 homologue expression were
   associated with loss and reversal of plasticity, respectively,
   suggesting that redundancy and modularity are gene network
   characteristics easily exploited by natural selection to produce
   evolutionary innovation. Distinct genetic mechanisms contribute to
   convergent evolution of photoperiod responses within sunflower,
   suggesting regulatory network architecture does not impose strong
   constraints on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{The Anacapa deer mouse is an endemic subspecies that inhabits Anacapa
   Island, part of Channel Islands National Park, California. We used
   mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene (COII) and 10
   microsatellite loci to evaluate the levels of genetic differentiation
   and variation in similar to 1400 Anacapa deer mice sampled before and
   for 4 years after a black rat (Rattus rattus) eradication campaign that
   included trapping, captive holding and reintroduction of deer mice. Both
   mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses indicated significant
   differentiation between Anacapa deer mice and mainland mice, and genetic
   variability of mainland mice was significantly higher than Anacapa mice
   even prior to reintroduction. Bayesian cluster analysis and Principal
   Coordinates Analysis indicated that East, Middle and West Anacapa mice
   were genetically differentiated from each other, but translocation of
   mice among islands resulted in the East population becoming less
   distinct as a result of management. Levels of heterozygosity were
   similar before and after management. However, numerous private alleles
   in the founder populations were not observed after reintroduction and
   shifts in allele frequencies occurred, indicating that the reintroduced
   populations experienced substantial genetic drift. Surprisingly, two
   mitochondrial haplotypes observed in an earlier study of Anacapa deer
   mice were lost in the 20 years prior to the rat eradication program,
   leaving only a single haplotype in Anacapa deer mice. This study
   demonstrates how genetic monitoring can help to understand the
   re-establishment of endemic species after the eradication of invasive
   species and to evaluate the effectiveness of the management strategies
   employed.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there exists a limited knowledge on the extent of temporal
   variation in population genetic parameters of natural populations. Here,
   we study the extent of temporal variation in population genetics by
   genotyping 151 genome-wide SNP markers polymorphic in 466 individuals
   collected from nine populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana
   during 4 years. Populations are located along an altitudinal climatic
   gradient from Mediterranean to subalpine environments in NE Spain, which
   has been shown to influence key demographic attributes and life cycle
   adaptations. Genetically, A. thaliana populations were more variable
   across space than over time. Common multilocus genotypes were detected
   several years in the same population, whereas low-frequency multilocus
   genotypes appeared only 1 year. High-elevation populations were
   genetically poorer and more variable over time than low-elevation
   populations, which might be caused by a higher overall demographic
   instability at higher altitudes. Estimated effective population sizes
   were low but also showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing
   altitude, suggesting a deeper impact of genetic drift at high-elevation
   populations. In comparison with single-year samplings, repeated
   genotyping over time captured substantially higher amount of genetic
   variation contained in A. thaliana populations. Furthermore, repeated
   genotyping of populations provided novel information on the genetic
   properties of A. thaliana populations and allowed hypothesizing on their
   underlying mechanisms. Therefore, including temporal genotyping
   programmes into traditional population genetic studies can significantly
   increase our understanding of the dynamics of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy fishing and other anthropogenic influences can have profound
   impact on a species' resilience to harvesting. Besides the decrease in
   the census and effective population size, strong declines in mature
   adults and recruiting individuals may lead to almost irreversible
   genetic changes in life-history traits. Here, we investigated the
   evolution of genetic diversity and effective population size in the
   heavily exploited sole (Solea solea), through the analysis of historical
   DNA from a collection of 1379 sole otoliths dating back from 1957.
   Despite documented shifts in life-history traits, neutral genetic
   diversity inferred from 11 microsatellite markers showed a remarkable
   stability over a period of 50 years of heavy fishing. Using simulations
   and corrections for fisheries induced demographic variation, both
   single-sample estimates and temporal estimates of effective population
   size (N-e) were always higher than 1000, suggesting that despite the
   severe census size decrease over a 50-year period of harvesting, genetic
   drift is probably not strong enough to significantly decrease the
   neutral diversity of this species in the North Sea. However, the
   inferred ratio of effective population size to the census size (N-e/N-c)
   appears very small (10(-5)), suggesting that overall only a low
   proportion of adults contribute to the next generation. The high N-e
   level together with the low N-e/N-c ratio is probably caused by a
   combination of an equalized reproductive output of younger cohorts, a
   decrease in generation time and a large variance in reproductive success
   typical for marine species. Because strong evolutionary changes in age
   and size at first maturation have been observed for sole, changes in
   adaptive genetic variation should be further monitored to detect the
   evolutionary consequences of human-induced selection.}},

Abstract = {{Rodent host dynamics and dispersal are thought to be critical for
   hantavirus epidemiology as they determine pathogen persistence and
   transmission within and between host populations. We used landscape
   genetics to investigate how the population dynamics of the bank vole
   Myodes glareolus, the host of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), vary with
   forest fragmentation and influence PUUV epidemiology. We sampled vole
   populations within the Ardennes, a French PUUV endemic area. We inferred
   demographic features such as population size, isolation and migration
   with regard to landscape configuration. We next analysed the influence
   of M. glareolus population dynamics on PUUV spatial distribution. Our
   results revealed that the global metapopulation dynamics of bank voles
   were strongly shaped by landscape features, including suitable patch
   size and connectivity. Large effective size in forest might therefore
   contribute to the higher observed levels of PUUV prevalence. By
   contrast, populations from hedge networks highly suffered from genetic
   drift and appeared strongly isolated from all other populations. This
   might result in high probabilities of local extinction for both M.
   glareolus and PUUV. Besides, we detected signatures of asymmetric bank
   vole migration from forests to hedges. These movements were likely to
   sustain PUUV in fragmented landscapes. In conclusion, our study provided
   arguments in favour of source-sink dynamics shaping PUUV persistence and
   spread in heterogeneous, Western European temperate landscapes. It
   illustrated the potential contribution of landscape genetics to the
   understanding of the epidemiological processes occurring at this local
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{The vulnerability of ecologically specialised species to environmental
   fluctuations has been well documented. However, population genetic
   structure can influence vulnerability to environmental change and recent
   studies have indicated that specialised species may have lower genetic
   diversity and greater population structuring compared to their
   generalist counterparts. To examine whether there were differences in
   population genetic structure between a dietary specialist (Chaetodon
   trifascialis) and a dietary generalist (Chaetodon lunulatus) we compared
   the demographic history and levels of gene flow of two related
   coral-feeding butterflyfishes. Using allele frequencies of >= 11
   microsatellite loci and >350 bases of mitochondrial control region
   sequence our analyses of C. trifascialis and C. lunulatus from five
   locations across the Pacific Ocean revealed contrasting demographic
   histories and levels of genetic structure. Heterozygosity excess tests,
   neutrality tests and mismatch distributions were all highly significant
   in the dietary specialist C. trifascialis (all P < 0.01), suggesting
   genetic bottlenecks have occurred in all locations. In contrast, we
   found little evidence of genetic bottlenecks for the dietary generalist
   C. lunulatus. High gene flow and low genetic structuring was detected
   among locations for C. trifascialis (AMOVA: R-ST = 0.0027, P = 0.371;
   Phi(ST) = 0.068, P < 0.0001). Contrary to our expectations, a greater
   level of genetic structuring between locations was detected for C.
   lunulatus (AMOVA: R-ST = 0.0277, Phi(ST) = 0.166, both P < 0.0001).
   These results suggest that dietary specialisation may affect demographic
   history through reductions in population size following resource
   declines, without affecting population structure through reductions in
   gene flow in the same way that habitat specialisation appears to.
   Although C. trifascialis is highly vulnerable to coral loss, the high
   gene flow detected here suggests populations will be able to recover
   from local declines through the migration of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change pose a clear threat
   to reef-building corals; however, the traits that might influence
   corals' survival and dispersal during climate change remain poorly
   understood. Global gene expression profiling is a powerful
   hypothesis-forming tool that can help elucidate these traits. Here, we
   applied a novel RNA-Seq protocol to study molecular responses to heat
   and settlement inducers in aposymbiotic larvae of the reef-building
   coral Acropora millepora. This analysis of a single full-sibling family
   revealed contrasting responses between short- (4-h) and long-term
   (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were
   up-regulated only in the short-term treatment, while the long-term
   treatment induced the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and
   up-regulation of genes associated with ion transport and metabolism
   (Ca2+ and CO32-). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a
   natural cue (crustose coralline algae, CCA) and a synthetic neuropeptide
   (GLW-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis, accompanied by
   differential expression of genes with known developmental roles. Some
   genes were regulated only by the natural cue, which may correspond to
   the recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that precede
   metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed under GLW-amide
   treatment. Validation of these expression profiles using qPCR confirmed
   the quantitative accuracy of our RNA-Seq approach. Importantly, qPCR
   analysis of different larval families revealed extensive variation in
   these responses depending on genetic background, including qualitative
   differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and down-regulation in
   another). Future studies of gene expression in corals will have to
   address this genetic variation, which could have important adaptive
   consequences for corals during global climate change.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3617-3630}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The tempo and mode of evolution of loci with a large effect on
   adaptation and reproductive isolation will influence the rate of
   evolutionary divergence and speciation. Desaturase loci are involved in
   key biochemical changes in long-chain fatty acids. In insects, these
   have been shown to influence adaptation to starvation or desiccation
   resistance and in some cases act as important pheromones. The desaturase
   gene family of Drosophila is known to have evolved by gene duplication
   and diversification, and at least one locus shows rapid evolution of
   sex-specific expression variation. Here, we examine the evolution of the
   gene family in species representing the Drosophila phylogeny. We find
   that the family includes more loci than have been previously described.
   Most are represented as single-copy loci, but we also find additional
   examples of duplications in loci which influence pheromone blends. Most
   loci show patterns of variation associated with purifying selection, but
   there are strong signatures of diversifying selection in new duplicates.
   In the case of a new duplicate of desat1 in the obscura group species,
   we show that strong selection on the coding sequence is associated with
   the evolution of sex-specific expression variation. It seems likely that
   both sexual selection and ecological adaptation have influenced the
   evolution of this gene family in Drosophila.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolutionary relationships between parasites and hosts can elevate the
   rate of evolutionary changes owing to reciprocal adaptations between
   coevolving partners. Such relationships can result in the evolution of
   host specificity. Recent methodological advances have permitted the
   recognition of cryptic lineages, with important consequences for our
   understanding of biological diversity. We used the European bitterling
   (Rhodeus amarus), a freshwater fish that parasitizes unionid mussels, to
   investigate host specialization across regions of recent and ancient
   sympatry between coevolving partners. We combined genetic data (12
   microsatellite and 2 mitochondrial markers) from five populations with
   experimental data for possible mechanisms of host species recognition
   (imprinting and conditioning). We found no strong evidence for the
   existence of cryptic lineages in R. amarus, though a small proportion of
   variation among individuals in an area of recent bitterling-mussel
   association was statistically significant in explaining host
   specificity. No other measures supported the existence of host-specific
   lineages. Behavioural data revealed a weak effect of conditioning that
   biased behavioural preferences towards specific host species. Host
   imprinting had no effect on oviposition behaviour. Overall, we
   established that populations of R. amarus show limited potential for
   specialization, manifested as weak effects of host conditioning and
   genetic within-population structure. Rhodeus amarus is the only species
   of mussel-parasitizing fish in Europe, which contrasts with the
   species-rich communities of bitterling in eastern Asia where several
   host-specific bitterling occur. We discuss costs and constraints on the
   evolution of host-specific lineages in our study system and more
   generally.}},

Abstract = {{Wolbachia are endocellular bacteria known for manipulating the
   reproductive systems of many of their invertebrate hosts. Wolbachia are
   transmitted vertically from mother to offspring. In addition, new
   infections result from horizontal transmission between different host
   species. However, to what extent horizontal transmission plays a role in
   the spread of a new infection through the host population is unknown.
   Here, we investigate whether horizontal transmission of Wolbachia can
   explain clonal genetic variation in natural populations of Leptopilina
   clavipes, a parasitoid wasp infected with a parthenogenesis-inducing
   Wolbachia. We assessed variance of markers on the nuclear, mitochondrial
   and Wolbachia genomes. The nuclear and mitochondrial markers displayed
   significant and congruent variation among thelytokous wasp lineages,
   showing that multiple lineages have become infected with Wolbachia. The
   alternative hypothesis in which a single female became infected, the
   daughters of which mated with males (thus introducing nuclear genetic
   variance) cannot account for the presence of concordant variance in
   mtDNA. All Wolbachia markers, including the hypervariable wsp gene, were
   invariant, suggesting that only a single strain of Wolbachia is
   involved. These results show that Wolbachia has transferred horizontally
   to infect multiple female lineages during the early spread through L.
   clavipes. Remarkably, multiple thelytokous lineages have persisted side
   by side in the field for tens of thousands of generations.}},

Abstract = {{In barley, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) gene
   situated on chromosome 3H is recognized as an important source of
   resistance to the bymoviruses Barley yellow mosaic virus and Barley mild
   mosaic virus. In modern barley cultivars, two recessive eIF4E alleles,
   rym4 and rym5, confer different isolate-specific resistances. In this
   study, the sequence of eIF4E was analysed in 1090 barley landraces and
   noncurrent cultivars originating from 84 countries. An exceptionally
   high nucleotide diversity was evident in the coding sequence of eIF4E
   but not in either the adjacent MCT-1 gene or the sequence-related
   eIF(iso)4E gene situated on chromosome 1H. Surprisingly, all nucleotide
   polymorphisms detected in the coding sequence of eIF4E resulted in amino
   acid changes. A total of 47 eIF4E haplotypes were identified, and
   phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood provided evidence of
   strong positive selection acting on this barley gene. The majority of
   eIF4E haplotypes were found to be specific to distinct geographic
   regions. Furthermore, the eI4FE haplotype diversity (uh) was found to be
   considerably higher in East Asia, whereas SNP genotyping identified a
   comparatively low degree of genome-wide genetic diversity in 16 of 17
   tested accessions (each carrying a different eIF4E haplotype) from this
   same region. In addition, selection statistic calculations using
   coalescent simulations showed evidence of non-neutral variation for
   eIF4E in several geographic regions, including East Asia, the region
   with a long history of the bymovirus-induced yellow mosaic disease.
   Together these findings suggest that eIF4E may play a role in barley
   adaptation to local habitats.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3669-3680}},

Abstract = {{How males gain access to mates and the potential for female choice will
   determine whether polygyny can operate at several levels, from within
   litters and groups to the wider population. Female lesser flat-headed
   bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) form maternity groups in bamboo stems.
   Unusually for bats, they are multiparous, providing the opportunity to
   test whether multi-level polygyny differs among males depending on
   whether they roost with females, with males or are solitary. We
   genotyped 662 individuals from 54 internodes and analysed parentage of
   165 litters. Our results revealed 170 sets of paternal twins/triplets,
   of which 96 were full-sibs and 74 were half-sibs. We found that males
   captured roosting with females typically sired more offspring overall
   than did other males and also showed a greater tendency to monopolize
   paternity within both litters and roosting groups. In comparison, males
   that sired fewer full-sibs were assigned more maternal half-sibs. These
   latter individuals, which included solitary males and those from
   all-male groups, might gain copulations either via roaming with furtive
   mating or during visits by females. Indeed, female lesser flat-headed
   bats store sperm, so could benefit from multiple mating to reduce
   genetic incompatibilities. At the same time, however, we found no
   evidence of outbreeding. Finally, relatedness and mtDNA analyses
   revealed that polygyny also operated within matrilineal kin, suggesting
   a system that might promote social cohesiveness. Future studies of
   individual movements will help to determine the extent to which mixed
   paternities in litters, matrilines and groups are driven by male or
   female behaviour.}},

Title = {{Intraspecific support for the polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis in the

Abstract = {{The number of queens per colony and the number of matings per queen are
   the most important determinants of the genetic structure of ant
   colonies, and understanding their interrelationship is essential to the
   study of social evolution. The polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis argues
   that polygyny and polyandry should be negatively associated because both
   can result in increased intracolonial genetic variability and have
   costs. However, evidence for this long-debated hypothesis has been
   lacking at the intraspecific level. Here, we investigated the colony
   genetic structure in the Australian bulldog ant Myrmecia brevinoda. The
   numbers of queens per colony varied from 1 to 6. Nestmate queens within
   polygynous colonies were on average related (r(qq) = 0.171 +/- 0.019),
   but the overall relatedness between queens and their mates was
   indistinguishable from zero (r(qm) = 0.037 +/- 0.030). Queens were
   inferred to mate with 1-10 males. A lack of genetic isolation by
   distance among nests indicated the prevalence of independent colony
   foundation. In accordance with the polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis,
   the number of queens per colony was significantly negatively associated
   with the estimated number of matings (Spearman rank correlation R =
   -0.490, P = 0.028). This study thus provides the rare intraspecific
   evidence for the polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis. We suggest that the
   high costs of multiple matings and the strong effect of multiple mating
   on intracolonial genetic diversity may be essential to the negative
   association between polygyny and polyandry and that any attempt to
   empirically test this hypothesis should place emphasis upon these two
   key underlying aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic interactions of plants with true fungi are a well-known and
   widespread phenomenon, which includes mycorrhiza and non-mycorrhizal
   endophytes like species of Epichloe. Despite the fact that these
   organisms intrude into plants, neither strong defence reactions nor the
   onset of symptoms of disease can be observed in most or even all
   infested plants, in contrast to endophytic pathogens. Oomycetes are
   fungal-like organisms belonging to the kingdom Straminipila, which
   includes diatoms and seaweeds. Although having evolved many convergent
   traits with true fungi and occupying similar evolutionary niches,
   widespread oomycete endophytes are not known to date, although more than
   500 endophytic pathogens, including species of the obligate biotrophic
   genus Albugo, have been described. Here, we report that oomycetes of the
   genus Albugo are widespread in siliques of natural host populations. A
   total of 759 plants, encompassing four genera with rare reports of white
   blister incidents and one with common incidents, were collected from 25
   sites in Germany. Nested PCR with species-specific primers revealed that
   5-27\% of the hosts with rare disease incidence carried asymptomatic
   Albugo in their siliques, although only on a single plant of 583
   individuals, an isolated pustule on a single leaf could be observed.
   Control experiments confirmed that these results were not because of
   attached spores, but because of endophytic mycelium. Vertical
   inheritance of oomycete infections has been reported for several plant
   pathogens, and it seems likely that in nature this way of transmission
   plays an important role in the persistence of asymptomatic endophytic
   Albugo species.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Measuring heritable genetic variation is important for understanding
   patterns of trait evolution in wild populations, and yet studies of
   quantitative genetic parameters estimated directly in the field are
   limited by logistic constraints, such as the difficulties of inferring
   relatedness among individuals in the wild. Marker-based approaches have
   received attention because they can potentially be applied directly to
   wild populations. For long-lived, self-compatible plant species where
   pedigrees are inadequate, the regression-based method proposed by
   Ritland has the appeal of estimating heritabilities from marker-based
   estimates of relatedness. The method has been difficult to implement in
   some plant populations, however, because it requires significant
   variance in relatedness across the population. Here, we show that the
   method can be readily applied to compare the ability of different traits
   to respond to selection, within populations. For several taxa of the
   perennial herb genus Aquilegia, we estimated heritabilities of floral
   and vegetative traits and, combined with estimates of natural selection,
   compared the ability to respond to selection of both types of traits
   under current conditions. The intra-population comparisons showed that
   vegetative traits have a higher potential for evolution, because
   although they are as heritable as floral traits, selection on them is
   stronger. These patterns of potential evolution are consistent with
   macroevolutionary trends in the European lineage of the genus.}},

Abstract = {{Both mating system and population history can have large impacts on
   genetic diversity and population structure. Here, we use multilocus
   sequence data to investigate how these factors impact two closely
   related Brassicaceae species: the selfing Capsella rubella and the
   outcrossing C. grandiflora. To do this, we have sequenced 16 loci in
   approximately 70 individuals from 7 populations of each species.
   Patterns of population structure differ strongly between the two
   species. In C. grandiflora, we observe an isolation-by-distance pattern
   and identify three clearly delineated genetic groups. In C. rubella,
   where we estimate the selfing rate to be 0.90-0.94, the pattern is less
   clear with some sampling populations forming separate genetic clusters
   while others are highly mixed. The two species also have divergent
   histories. Our analysis gives support for a bottleneck approximately 73
   kya (20-139 kya) in C. rubella, which most likely represents speciation
   from C. grandiflora. In C. grandiflora, there is moderate support for
   the standard neutral model in 2 of 3 genetic clusters, while the third
   cluster and the total data set show evidence of expansion. It is clear
   that mating system has an impact on these two species, for example
   affecting the level of genetic variation and the genetic structure.
   However, our results also clearly show that a combination of past and
   present processes, some of which are not affected by mating system, is
   needed to explain the differences between C. rubella and C. grandiflora.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are notorious for disturbing terrestrial ecosystems worldwide,
   especially those that are in close proximity to urban areas. This
   disturbance has involved the accumulation of various types of chemical
   pollutants, of either agricultural or industrial origins, in both soil
   and water ecosystems. Pollutants have sometimes included essential plant
   nutrients, such as phosphate and nitrate, which have piled up throughout
   the years in many ecosystems as a consequence of aggressive agricultural
   practices, and a number of toxic or trace metals, e. g. iron, nickel or
   zinc that are important at low levels for the fitness of living
   organisms, but otherwise toxic at high concentrations (Ker \& Charest
   2010; Audet \& Charest 2008). In order to reduce the load of toxic
   elements, scientists have used the natural capacity of several plant
   species to sequestrate them from the soil and, ultimately, render them
   harmless. This process, called phytoremediation, is rather slow, as most
   plants take years to build up their biomass but has been shown to be
   `boostable' under experimental conditions in the presence of a
   particular group of plant symbionts in the soil - the arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Gohre \& Paszkowski 2006). These latter
   organisms are now widely recognized as being very beneficial for
   purposes of phytoremediation, but their biodiversity in the most
   disturbed ecosystems is still virtually unknown. Are these fungi really
   abundant in heavily polluted soils, or are their communities shrunken
   down like those of other microorganisms in the presence of heavy
   pollution? In this issue of Molecular Ecology, the study by Hassan et
   al. (2011) provides answers to these specific questions by determining
   the extent of AMF biodiversity across several urbanized areas in the
   City of Montreal.}},

Abstract = {{Defining the scale of connectivity among marine populations and
   identifying the barriers to gene flow are tasks of fundamental
   importance for understanding the genetic structure of populations and
   for the design of marine reserves. Here, we investigated the population
   genetic structure at three spatial scales of the red gorgonian
   Paramuricea clavata (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), a key species dwelling in
   the coralligenous assemblages of the Mediterranean Sea. Colonies of P.
   clavata were collected from 39 locations across the Mediterranean Sea
   from Morocco to Turkey and analysed using microsatellite loci. Within
   three regions (Medes, Marseille and North Corsica), sampling was
   obtained from multiple locations and at different depths. Three
   different approaches (measures of genetic differentiation, Bayesian
   clustering and spatially explicit maximum-difference algorithm) were
   used to determine the pattern of genetic structure. We identified
   genetic breaks in the spatial distribution of genetic diversity, which
   were concordant with oceanographic conditions in the Mediterranean Sea.
   We revealed a high level of genetic differentiation among populations
   and a pattern of isolation by distance across the studied area and
   within the three regions, underlining short effective larval dispersal
   in this species. We observed genetic differentiation among populations
   in the same locality dwelling at different depths, which may be
   explained by local oceanographic conditions and which may allow a
   process of local adaptation of the populations to their environment. We
   discuss the implications of our results for the conservation of the
   species, which is exposed to various threats.}},

Abstract = {{Light-induced shifts in cone frequency and opsin expression occur in
   many aquatic species. Yet little is known about how quickly animals can
   alter opsin expression and, thereby, track their visual environments.
   Similarly, little is known about whether adult animals can alter opsin
   expression or whether shifts in opsin expression are limited to critical
   developmental windows. We took adult wild-caught bluefin killifish
   (Lucania goodei) from three different lighting environments (spring,
   swamp and variable), placed them under two different lighting treatments
   (clear vs. tea-stained water) and monitored opsin expression over 4
   weeks. We measured opsin expression for five previously described opsins
   (SWS1, SWS2B, SWS2A, RH2-1 and LWS) as well as RH2-2 which we discovered
   via 454 sequencing. We used two different metrics of opsin expression.
   We measured expression of each opsin relative to a housekeeping gene and
   the proportional expression of each opsin relative to the total pool of
   opsins. Population and lighting environment had large effects on opsin
   expression which were present at the earliest time points indicating
   rapid shifts in expression. The two measures of expression produced
   radically different patterns. Proportional measures indicated large
   effects of light on SWS1 expression, whereas relative measures indicated
   no such effect. Instead, light had large effects on the relative
   expression of SWS2B, RH2-2, RH2-1 and LWS. We suggest that proportional
   measures of opsin expression are best for making inferences about colour
   vision, but that measures relative to a housekeeping gene are better for
   making conclusions about which opsins are differentially regulated.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal germination timing of Arabidopsis thaliana strongly influences
   overall life history expression and is the target of intense natural
   selection. This seasonal germination timing depends strongly on the
   interaction between genetics and seasonal environments both before and
   after seed dispersal. DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is the first gene
   that has been identified to be associated with natural variation in
   primary dormancy in A. thaliana. Here, we report interaccession
   variation in DOG1 expression and document that DOG1 expression is
   associated with seed-maturation temperature effects on germination; DOG1
   expression increased when seeds were matured at low temperature, and
   this increased expression was associated with increased dormancy of
   those seeds. Variation in DOG1 expression suggests a geographical
   structure such that southern accessions, which are more dormant, tend to
   initiate DOG1 expression earlier during seed maturation and achieved
   higher expression levels at the end of silique development than did
   northern accessions. Although elimination of the synthesis of
   phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) results in the elimination of maternal
   temperature effects on dormancy, DOG1 expression predicted dormancy
   better than expression of genes involved in ABA metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid zone along an environmental gradient should contain a clinal
   pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation. This occurs because
   divergent selection in the two parental habitats is typically strong
   enough to overcome the homogenizing effects of gene flow across the
   environmental transition. We studied hybridization between two
   parapatric tree squirrels (Tamiasciurus spp.) across a forest gradient
   over which the two species vary in coloration, cranial morphology and
   body size. We sampled 397 individuals at 29 locations across a 600-km
   transect to seek genetic evidence for hybridization; upon confirming
   hybridization, we examined levels of genetic admixture in relation to
   maintenance of phenotypic divergence despite potentially homogenizing
   gene flow. Applying population assignment analyses to microsatellite
   data, we found that Tamiasciurus douglasii and T. hudsonicus form two
   distinct genetic clusters but also hybridize, mostly within transitional
   forest habitat. Overall, based on this nuclear analysis, 48\% of the
   specimens were characterized as T. douglasii, 9\% as hybrids and 43\% as
   T. hudsonicus. Hybrids appeared to be reproductively viable, as
   evidenced by the presence of later-generation hybrid genotypes. Observed
   clines in ecologically important phenotypic traits-fur coloration and
   cranial morphology-were sharper than the cline of putatively neutral
   mtDNA, which suggests that divergent selection may maintain phenotypic
   distinctiveness. The relatively recent divergence of these two species
   (probably late Pleistocene), apparent lack of prezygotic isolating
   mechanisms and geographic coincidence of cline centres for both genetic
   and phenotypic variation suggest that environmental factors play a large
   role in maintaining the distinctiveness of these two species across the
   hybrid zone.}},

   without meiotic recombination. In fishes, these so-called unisexual
   lineages usually comprise only females and utilize co-occurring males of
   a related sexual species to reproduce via gynogenesis or hybridogenesis.
   Here, we examine patterns of microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) variation in a widespread group of freshwater fishes (carp
   gudgeons; Hypseleotris spp.) to investigate a long-standing proposal
   that this group includes unisexual forms. We show that the mtDNA genome
   of most carp gudgeons in tributaries of the Goulburn River belongs to
   one of two deeply divided clades (similar to 10\% cyt b divergence) and
   that nuclear variation divides the same individuals into four distinct
   groups. Group 1 exhibits the genotypic proportions of a random mating
   population and has a 1: 1 sex ratio. Two other groups are extremely
   sex-biased (98\% male, 96\% female), exhibit excess heterozygosity at
   most loci and share at least one allele per locus with group 1. We
   propose that these two groups represent `unisexual' hybridogenetic
   lineages and that both utilize co-occurring group 1 as sexual host.
   Interestingly, the fourth distinct group appears to represent hybrid
   offspring of the two putative hybridogenetic lineages. The propagation
   of clonal haploid genomes by both males and females and the ability of
   these clones to unite and form sexually mature diploid hybrid offspring
   may represent a novel mechanism that contributes to the dynamics of
   coexistence between hybridogenetic lineages and their sexual hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Exact location and number of glacial refugia still remain unclear for
   many European cold-blooded terrestrial vertebrates. We performed a
   fine-scaled multilocus phylogeographic analysis of two Bombina species
   combining mitochondrial variation of 950 toads from 385 sites and
   nuclear genes (Rag-1, Ncx-1) from a subset of samples to reconstruct
   their colonization and contemporary variation patterns. We identified
   the lowlands northwest of the Black Sea and the Carpathians to be
   important refugial areas for B. bombina and B. variegata, respectively.
   This result emphasizes the importance of Central European refugia for
   ectothermic terrestrial species, far north of the Mediterranean areas
   regarded as exclusive glacial refugia for the animals. Additional
   refugia for B. variegata have been located in the southern Apennines and
   Balkans. In contrast, no evidence for the importance of other east
   European plains as refugial regions has been found. The distribution of
   mtDNA and Ncx-1 variation suggests the presence of local refugia near
   the Black Sea for B. bombina; however, coalescent simulations did not
   allow to distinguish whether one or two refugia were present in the
   region. Strong genetic drift apparently accompanied postglacial
   expansions reducing diversity in the colonization areas. Extended
   sampling, coupled with the multilocus isolation with migration analysis,
   revealed a limited and geographically restricted gene flow from the
   Balkan to Carpathian populations of B. variegata. However, despite
   proximity of inferred B. bombina and B. variegata refugia, gene exchange
   between them was not detected.}},

Abstract = {{The Southern Ocean contains some of the most isolated islands on Earth,
   and fundamental questions remain regarding their colonization and the
   connectivity of their coastal biotas. Here, we conduct a genetic
   investigation into the Cellana strigilis (limpet) complex that was
   originally classified based on morphological characters into six
   subspecies, five of which are endemic to the New Zealand (NZ)
   subantarctic and Chatham islands (44-52 degrees S). Previous genetic
   analyses of C. strigilis from six of the seven island groups revealed
   two lineages with little or no within-lineage variation. We analysed C.
   strigilis samples from all seven island groups using two mitochondrial
   (COI and 16S), one nuclear (ATPase beta) and 58 loci from four randomly
   amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs) and confirmed the existence of
   two distinct lineages. The pronounced genetic structuring within each
   lineage and the presence of private haplotypes in individual islands are
   the result of little genetic connectivity and therefore very high
   self-recruitment. This study supports the significance of the
   subantarctic islands as refugia during the last glacial maximum and adds
   to the knowledge of contemporary population connectivity among coastal
   populations of remote islands in large oceans and the distance barrier
   to gene flow that exists in the sea (despite its continuous medium) for
   most taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Sundaland has a dynamic geographic history because its landmasses were
   periodically interconnected when sea levels fell during glacial periods.
   Superimposed on this geographic dynamism were environmental changes
   related to climatic oscillations. To investigate how tropical taxa
   responded to such changes, we studied the divergence and demographic
   history of two co-distributed rainforest passerine species, Arachnothera
   longirostra and Malacocincla malaccensis. We sampled birds primarily
   from Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, which straddle the now-submerged
   Sunda shelf, and analysed multilocus DNA data with a variety of
   coalescent and gene genealogy methods. Cross-shelf divergence in both
   species occurred well before the last glacial maximum, i.e., before the
   most recent land connection. However, post-divergence gene flow
   occurred, and it was more pronounced in A. longirostra (a highly vagile
   nectarivore/insectivore) than in M. malaccensis (an understory
   insectivore). Despite current habitat continuity on Borneo, the
   population of M. malaccensis in northeastern Borneo is substantially
   divergent from that on the rest of the island. The NE population
   experienced dramatic demographic fluctuations, probably because of
   competition with the other population, which expanded from western
   Borneo after the mid-Pleistocene. In contrast, the Borneo population of
   A. longirostra has little structure and appears to have experienced
   demographic expansion 16 kya, long after it had diverged from the Malay
   Peninsula population (630-690 kya). Malay Peninsula populations of both
   species have remained relatively stable. Overall, the most recent
   glacial period was not the chief determinant of the evolutionary
   dynamics of our study species, and in this respect, they are different
   from temperate species.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3439-3454}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent molecular research on Antarctic benthic organisms has challenged
   traditional taxonomic classifications, suggesting that our current
   perceptions of Antarctic biodiversity and species distributions must be
   thoroughly revised. Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the
   intraspecific level remains poorly understood, particularly in eastern
   Antarctica. We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two
   sibling amphipod species that could be collected on a circum-Antarctic
   scale: Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus. Haplotype networks and
   Bayesian phylogenies based on mitochondrial (COI, CytB) and nuclear
   (ITS2) DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of
   Eusirus, with several occurring in sympatry and at least one likely to
   have a true circum- Antarctic distribution. Within species, gene flow
   was often highly restricted, consistent with a brooding life history and
   in some cases suggestive of current or future allopatric speciation.
   Patterns of genetic structure were not always predictable: one cryptic
   species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation
   across similar to 150 km in eastern Antarctica (F-ST > 0.47, P < 0.01),
   yet another was remarkably homogenous across similar to 5000 km (F-ST =
   0.00, P = 1.00). Genetic diversity also varied among cryptic species,
   independent of sample size (pi = 0.00-0.99). These results indicate
   several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic amphipods
   that are neither apparent from previous taxonomic or ecological studies
   nor predictable from their life history. Such genetic diversity and
   structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic benthic
   organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent
   re-establishment of populations on the shelf, and highlight our
   misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory predicts that in colonies of social Hymenoptera
   headed by a multiple-mated queen, workers should benefit from policing
   eggs laid by other workers. Foster \& Ratnieks provided evidence that in
   the vespine wasp Dolichovespula saxonica, workers police other workers'
   eggs only in colonies headed by a multiple-mated queen, but not in those
   headed by a single- mated one. This conclusion, however, was based on a
   relatively small sample size, and the original study did not control for
   possible confounding variables such as the seasonal colony progression
   of the nests. Our aim, therefore, was to reinvestigate whether or not
   facultative worker policing occurs in D. saxonica. Remarkably, our data
   show that in the studied Danish population, there was no correlation
   between worker-worker relatedness and the percentage of worker-derived
   males. In addition, we show that variability in cuticular hydrocarbon
   profiles among the workers did not significantly correlate with
   relatedness and that workers therefore probably did not have sufficient
   information on queen mating frequency from the workers' cuticular
   hydrocarbon profiles. Hence, there was no evidence that workers
   facultatively policed other workers' eggs in response to queen mating
   frequency. Nevertheless, our data do show that the seasonal progression
   of the nest and the location in which the males were reared both explain
   the patterns of worker reproduction found. Overall, our results suggest
   that the earlier evidence for facultative worker policing in D. saxonica
   may have been caused by accidental correlations with certain confounding
   variables, or, alternatively, that there are large interpopulation
   differences in the expression of worker policing.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community
   structure from the roots and associated soil of Plantago major
   (plantain) plants growing on sites polluted with trace metals (TM) and
   on unpolluted sites. Uncontaminated and TM-contaminated sites containing
   As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sn and Zn were selected based on a survey of the TM
   concentration in soils of community gardens in the City of Montreal.
   Total genomic DNA was extracted directly from these samples. PCR
   followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE),
   augmented by cloning and sequencing, as well as direct sequencing
   techniques, was all used to investigate AMF community structure. We
   found a decreased diversity of native AMF (assessed by the number of AMF
   ribotypes) in soils and plant roots harvested from TM-polluted soils
   compared with unpolluted soils. We also found that community structure
   was modified by TM contamination. Various species of Glomus,
   Scutellospora aurigloba and S. calospora were the most abundant
   ribotypes detected in unpolluted soil; ribotypes of G. etunicatum, G.
   irregulare/G. intraradices and G. viscosum were found in both polluted
   and unpolluted soils, while ribotypes of G. mosseae and Glomus spp. (B9
   and B13) were dominant in TM-polluted soils. The predominance of G.
   mosseae in metal-polluted sites suggests the tolerance of this species
   to TM stress, as well as its potential use for phytoremediation. These
   data are relevant for our understanding of how AMF microbial communities
   respond to natural environments that contain a broad variety of toxic
   inorganic compounds and will substantially expand our knowledge of AMF
   ecology and biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial populations can display high levels of genetic structuring but
   the forces that influence this are incompletely understood. Here, by
   combining modelling approaches with multilocus sequence data for the
   zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter, we investigated how ecological factors
   such as niche (host) separation relate to population structure. We
   analysed seven housekeeping genes from published C. jejuni and C. coli
   isolate collections from a range of food and wild animal sources as well
   as abiotic environments. By reconstructing genetic structure and the
   patterns of ancestry, we quantified C. jejuni host association, inferred
   ancestral populations, investigated genetic admixture in different hosts
   and determined the host origin of recombinant C. jejuni alleles found in
   hybrid C. coli lineages. Phylogenetically distinct C. jejuni lineages
   were associated with phylogenetically distinct wild birds. However, in
   the farm environment, phylogenetically distant host animals shared
   several C. jejuni lineages that could not be segregated according to
   host origin using these analyses. Furthermore, of the introgressed C.
   jejuni alleles found in C. coli lineages, 73\% were attributed to
   genotypes associated with food animals. Our results are consistent with
   an evolutionary scenario where distinct Campylobacter lineages are
   associated with different host species but the ecological factors that
   maintain this are different in domestic animals such that
   phylogenetically distant animals can harbour closely related strains.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of malaria and related haemosporidian parasites
   (Haemosporida) are responsible for diseases in wild and domestic
   animals. These pathogens are exclusively transmitted by blood-sucking
   dipteran insects (Diptera). Traditional vector studies, which are based
   mainly on experimental infection and subsequent dissection of insects,
   are time-consuming, so progress in the identification of the vectors has
   been slow. Since the discovery of haemosporidians in wildlife by V.
   Danilewsky in 1884, it took over 70 years to determine the main vector
   groups of these parasites. However, precise vector-parasite
   relationships remain insufficiently investigated in wildlife,
   particularly at the species level of haemosporidians and their vectors.
   Molecular tools have provided innovative opportunities to speed such
   research. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Martinez-de la Puente et
   al. (2011) collected, for the first time, a significant PCR-based set of
   data on the presence of lineages of the pigment-forming haemosporidians
   (species of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) in biting midges (Culicoides).
   They identified numerous associations between Culicoides spp. and
   Haemoproteus spp., indicating directions for future targeting vector
   studies of haemoproteids.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3087-3101}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{For over half a century, it has been known that the rate of
   morphological evolution appears to vary with the time frame of
   measurement. Rates of microevolutionary change, measured between
   successive generations, were found to be far higher than rates of
   macroevolutionary change inferred from the fossil record. More recently,
   it has been suggested that rates of molecular evolution are also time
   dependent, with the estimated rate depending on the timescale of
   measurement. This followed surprising observations that estimates of
   mutation rates, obtained in studies of pedigrees and laboratory
   mutation-accumulation lines, exceeded long-term substitution rates by an
   order of magnitude or more. Although a range of studies have provided
   evidence for such a pattern, the hypothesis remains relatively
   contentious. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion about the factors
   that can cause molecular rate estimates to be dependent on time. Here we
   present an overview of our current understanding of time-dependent
   rates. We provide a summary of the evidence for time-dependent rates in
   animals, bacteria and viruses. We review the various biological and
   methodological factors that can cause rates to be time dependent,
   including the effects of natural selection, calibration errors, model
   misspecification and other artefacts. We also describe the challenges in
   calibrating estimates of molecular rates, particularly on the
   intermediate timescales that are critical for an accurate
   characterization of time-dependent rates. This has important
   consequences for the use of molecular-clock methods to estimate
   timescales of recent evolutionary events.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in understanding patterns of seasonal
   migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering sites, both
   because differences in migratory behaviour can be associated with
   population differentiation and because knowledge of migratory
   connectivity is essential for understanding the ecology, evolution and
   conservation of migratory species. We present the first broad survey of
   geographic variation in the nuclear genome of breeding and wintering
   Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), which have previously served as a
   research system for the study of whether genetic markers and isotopes
   can reveal patterns of migratory connectivity. Using 153 samples
   surveyed at up to 257 variable amplified fragment length polymorphism
   markers, we show that Wilson's warblers consist of highly distinct
   western and eastern breeding groups, with all winter samples grouping
   with the western breeding group. Within the west, there is weak
   geographic differentiation, at a level insufficient for use in the
   assignment of wintering samples to specific areas. The distinctiveness
   of western and eastern genetic groups, with no known intermediates,
   strongly suggests that these two groups are cryptic species. Analysis of
   mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence variation shows that the estimated
   coalescence time between western and eastern clades is approximately 2.3
   Ma, a surprisingly old time of divergence that is more typical of
   distinct species than of subspecies. Given their morphological
   similarity but strong genetic differences, western and eastern Wilson's
   warblers present a likely case of association between divergence in
   migratory behaviour and the process of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Leishmania species of the subgenus Viannia and especially Leishmania
   Viannia guyanensis are responsible for a large proportion of New World
   leishmaniasis cases. Since a recent publication on Leishmania Viannia
   braziliensis, the debate on the mode of reproduction of Leishmania
   parasites has been reopened. A predominant endogamic reproductive mode
   (mating with relatives), together with strong Wahlund effects (sampling
   of strains from heterogeneous subpopulations), was indeed evidenced. To
   determine whether this hypothesis can be generalized to other Leishmania
   Viannia species, we performed a population genetic study on 153 human
   strains of L. (V.) guyanensis from French Guiana based on 12
   microsatellite loci. The results revealed important homozygosity and
   very modest linkage disequilibrium, which is in agreement with a high
   level of sexual recombination and substantial endogamy. These results
   also revealed a significant isolation by distance with relatively small
   neighbourhoods and hence substantial viscosity of Leishmania populations
   in French Guiana. These results are of epidemiological relevance and
   suggest a major role for natural hosts and/or vectors in parasite strain
   diffusion across the country as compared to human hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Admixed populations represent attractive biological models to study
   adaptive selection. Originating from several waves of recent
   introduction from European (EUT), African (AFT) and zebus (ZEB) cattle,
   New World Creole cattle allow investigating the response to tropical
   environmental challenges of these three ancestries. We here provide a
   detailed assessment of their genetic contributions to the Creole breed
   from Guadeloupe (CGU). We subsequently look for footprints of selection
   by combining results from tests based on the extent of haplotype
   homozygosity and the identification of excess/deficiency of local
   ancestry. To tackle these issues, 140 CGU individuals and 25 Brahman
   zebus from Martinique were genotyped at 44 057 SNPs. These data were
   combined to those available on 23 populations representative of EUT, AFT
   or ZEB. We found average proportions of 26.1\%, 36.0\% and 37.9\% of
   EUT, AFT and ZEB ancestries in the CGU genome indicating a higher level
   of African and zebu ancestries than suggested by historical records. We
   further identified 23 genomic regions displaying strong signal of
   selection, most of them being characterized by an excess of ZEB local
   ancestry. Among the candidate gene underlying these regions, several are
   associated with reproductive functions (RXFP2, PMEPA1, IGFBP3, KDR,
   PPP1R8, TBXA2R and SLC7A5) and metabolism (PDE1B and CYP46A1). Finally,
   two genes (CENTD3 and SAMD12) are involved in cellular signalization of
   immune response. This study illustrates the relevance of admixed
   populations to identify footprints of selection by combining several
   tests straightforward to implement on large data sets.}},

Abstract = {{A plant species' genetic population structure is the result of a complex
   combination of its life history, ecological preferences, position in the
   ecosystem and historical factors. As a result, many different
   statistical methods exist that measure different aspects of species'
   genetic structure. However, little is known about how these methods are
   interrelated and how they are related to a species' ecology and life
   history. In this study, we used the IntraBioDiv amplified fragment
   length polymorphisms data set from 27 high-alpine species to calculate
   eight genetic summary statistics that we jointly correlate to a set of
   six ecological and life-history traits. We found that there is a large
   amount of redundancy among the calculated summary statistics and that
   there is a significant association with the matrix of species traits. In
   a multivariate analysis, two main aspects of population structure were
   visible among the 27 species. The first aspect is related to the
   species' dispersal capacities and the second is most likely related to
   the species' postglacial recolonization of the Alps. Furthermore, we
   found that some summary statistics, most importantly Mantel's r and
   Jost's D, show different behaviour than expected based on theory. We
   therefore advise caution in drawing too strong conclusions from these
   statistics.}},

Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3156-3166}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Mutual information (I) provides a robust measure of genetic
   differentiation for the purposes of estimating dispersal between
   populations. At present, however, there is little predictive theory for
   I. The growing importance in population biology of analyses of
   single-nucleotide and other single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) is a
   potent reason for developing an analytic theory for I with respect to a
   single locus. This study represents a first step towards such a theory.
   We present theoretical predictions of I between two populations with
   respect to a single haploid biallelic locus. Dynamical and steady-state
   forecasts of I are derived from a Wright-Fisher model with symmetrical
   mutation between alleles and symmetrical dispersal between populations.
   Analytical predictions of a simple Taylor approximation to I are in good
   agreement with numerical simulations of I and with data on I from SFP
   analyses of dispersal experiments on Drosophila fly populations. The
   theory presented here also provides a basis for the future inclusion of
   selection effects and extension to multiallelic loci.}},

Title = {{The parallel evolution of dwarfism in Arctic charr is accompanied by
   adaptive divergence in mTOR-pathway gene expression}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3167-3184}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ecological factors have a major role in shaping natural variation in
   body size, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
   Icelandic Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) populations represent an
   ideal model to understand body-size evolution, because adult dwarfism
   has arisen independently on multiple occasions in response to parallel
   environmental pressures. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
   pathway transmits signals from the environment to control cellular
   growth and is a primary candidate to be under selection for the dwarf
   phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we modified `inputs' to this pathway
   in five dwarf and two generalist populations (with ancestral life
   history and body-size traits), using a standardized manipulation of food
   intake in a common environment. The skeletal muscle transcript levels of
   21 mTOR-pathway genes were quantified in 274 individuals (similar to
   6000 datapoints), and statistical modelling was used to elucidate
   sources of variation. Constitutive expression differences between
   populations were the main component of variation for around
   three-quarters of the studied genes, irrespective of nutritional-state
   and body-size phenotype. There was evidence for stabilizing selection
   acting among populations, conserving the nutritionally dependent
   regulation of pathway genes controlling muscle atrophy. There were three
   genes (mTOR, 4E-BP-1 and IGFBP4), where the expression variation between
   dwarf and generalist populations exceeded the between-population
   variation. Divergence in the expression of these candidate adaptive
   genes was most evident during a period of rapid growth following
   sustained fasting and was directionally consistent with their functions
   regulating growth and protein synthesis. We concluded that selection has
   operated efficiently to shape gene expression evolution in Icelandic
   charr populations and that the regulation of certain mTOR-pathway genes
   evolved adaptively in locations favouring dwarfism, resulting in reduced
   muscle protein accretion under growth-favouring conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of intra- and interspecific gene flow in speciation and
   species evolution are topics of great current interest in molecular
   ecology and evolutionary biology. Recent modelling studies call for new
   empirical data to test hypotheses arising from the recent shift from a
   `whole-genome reproductive isolation' view to a `genic' view of species
   and speciation. Particularly scarce (and thus of particular interest)
   are molecular genetic data on recently radiated, naturally hybridizing
   species in strongly structured and species-rich environments. Here, we
   studied four sympatric plant species (Pitcairnia spp.; Bromeliaceae)
   adapted to Neotropical inselbergs (isolated outcrops resembling habitat
   `islands' in tropical rainforests) using nuclear and plastid DNA.
   Patterns of plastid DNA haplotype sharing and nuclear genomic admixture
   suggest the presence of both, incomplete lineage sorting and
   interspecific gene flow over extended periods of time. Integrity and
   cohesion of inselberg species of Pitcairnia are maintained despite
   introgression and in the face of extremely low within-species migration
   rates (N(e)m < 1 migrant per generation). Cross-evaluation of our
   genetic data against published pollination experiments indicate that
   species integrity is maintained by the simultaneous action of multiple
   prezygotic barriers, including flowering phenology, pollinator isolation
   and divergent mating systems. Postzygotic Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller
   incompatibilities appear to contribute to isolation, as suggested by
   asymmetric introgression rates of single loci. Our results suggest that
   incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and introgression form
   integral aspects of adaptive radiation in Neotropical inselberg
   `archipelagos'. Inselbergs with multiple closely related co-occurring
   species should be of special interest to students of speciation in
   mountain systems, and to ongoing conservation programmes in the Atlantic
   Rainforest biodiversity hotspot.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidization is thought to result in instant sympatric speciation,
   but several cases of hybrid zones between one of the parental species
   and its polyploid derivative have been documented. Previous work showed
   that diploid Sphagnum lescurii is an allopolyploid derived from the
   haploids S. lescurii (maternal progenitor) and S. subsecundum (paternal
   progenitor). Here, we report the results from analyses of a population
   where allodiploid and haploid S. lescurii co-occur and produce
   sporophytes. We tested (i) whether haploids and diploids form hybrid
   triploid sporophytes; (ii) how hybrid and nonhybrid sporophytes compare
   in fitness; (iii) whether hybrid sporophytes form viable spores; (iv)
   the ploidy of any viable gametophyte offspring from hybrid sporophytes;
   (v) the relative viability of sporelings derived from hybrid and
   nonhybrid sporophytes; and (vi) if interploidal hybridization results in
   introgression between the allopolyploid and its haploid progenitor. We
   found that triploid hybrid sporophytes do occur and are larger than
   nonhybrid sporophytes, but exhibit very low germination percentages and
   produce sporelings that develop more slowly than those from nonhybrid
   sporophytes. All sporophytes attached to haploid gametophytes were
   triploid and were sired by diploid males, but all sporophytes attached
   to diploid gametophytes were tetraploid. This asymmetric pattern of
   interploidal hybridization is related to an absence of haploid male
   gametophytes in the population. Surprisingly, all sporelings from
   triploid sporophytes were triploid, yet were genetically variable,
   suggesting some form of aberrant meiosis that warrants further study.
   There was limited (but some) evidence of introgression between
   allodiploid and haploid S. lescurii.}},

Abstract = {{Southwestern Australia has been recognized as a biodiversity hot spot of
   global significance, and it is particularly well known for its
   considerable diversity of flowering plant species. Questions of interest
   are how this region became so diverse and whether its fauna show similar
   diverse patterns of speciation. Here, we carried out a phylogeographic
   study of trapdoor spiders (Migidae: Moggridgea), a presumed Gondwanan
   lineage found in wet forest localities across southwestern Australia.
   Phylogenetic, molecular clock and population genetic analyses of
   mitochondrial (mtDNA) COI gene and ITS rRNA (internal transcribed
   spacer) data revealed considerable phylogeographic structuring of
   Moggridgea populations, with evidence for long-term (>3 million years)
   isolation of at least nine populations in different geographic
   locations, including upland regions of the Stirling and Porongurup
   Ranges. High levels of mtDNA divergence and no evidence of recent
   mitochondrial gene flow among valley populations of the Stirling Range
   suggest that individual valleys have acted as refugia for the spiders
   throughout the Pleistocene. Our findings support the hypothesis that
   climate change, particularly the aridification of Australia after the
   late Miocene, and the topography of the landscape, which allowed
   persistence of moist habitats, have been major drivers of speciation in
   southwestern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific brood parasitism (IBP) is a remarkable phenomenon by which
   parasitic females can increase their reproductive output by laying eggs
   in conspecific females' nests in addition to incubating eggs in their
   own nest. Kin selection could explain the tolerance, or even the
   selective advantage, of IBP, but different models of IBP based on game
   theory yield contradicting predictions. Our analyses of seven
   polymorphic autosomal microsatellites in two eider duck colonies
   indicate that relatedness between host and parasitizing females is
   significantly higher than the background relatedness within the colony.
   This result is unlikely to be a by-product of relatives nesting in close
   vicinity, as nest distance and genetic identity are not correlated. For
   eider females that had been ring-marked during the decades prior to our
   study, our analyses indicate that (i) the average age of parasitized
   females is higher than the age of nonparasitized females, (ii) the
   percentage of nests with alien eggs increases with the age of nesting
   females, (iii) the level of IBP increases with the host females' age,
   and (iv) the number of own eggs in the nest of parasitized females
   significantly decreases with age. IBP may allow those older females
   unable to produce as many eggs as they can incubate to gain indirect
   fitness without impairing their direct fitness: genetically related
   females specialize in their energy allocation, with young females
   producing more eggs than they can incubate and entrusting these to their
   older relatives. Intraspecific brood parasitism in ducks may constitute
   cooperation among generations of closely related females.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{3251-3260}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Relatedness is a central parameter in the evolution of sociality,
   because kin selection theory assumes that individuals involved in
   altruistic interactions are related. At least three reproductive
   characteristics are known to profoundly affect colony kin structure in
   social insects: the number of reproductive queens per colony, the
   relatedness among breeding queens and queen mating frequency. Both the
   occurrence of multiple queens (polygyny) and multiple mating (polyandry)
   decrease within-colony relatedness, while mating among sibs increases
   relatedness between the workers and the brood they rear. Using DNA
   microsatellites, we performed a detailed genetic analysis of the colony
   kin structure and breeding system in three ant species belonging to the
   genus Plagiolepis: P. schmitzii, P. taurica and P. maura. Our data show
   that queens of the three species mate multiply: queens of P. maura mate
   with 1-2 males, queens of P. taurica with 3-11 males and queens of P.
   schmitzii may have 1-14 different mates. Moreover, colonies are headed
   by multiple queens: P. taurica and P. maura are facultatively
   polygynous, while P. schmitzii is obligately polygynous. Despite
   polyandry and polygyny, relatedness within colonies remains high because
   all species are characterized by sib-mating, with a fixation index F(it)
   = 0.25 in P. taurica, 0.24 in P. schmitzii and 0.26 in P. maura, and
   because the male mates of a queen are on average closely related.}},

Number = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The Selection, Constraint, Restraint and Senescence Hypotheses predict
   how breeding success should vary with age. The Selection Hypothesis
   predicts between-individual variation arising from quality differences;
   the other hypotheses predict within-individual variation due to
   differing skills or physiological condition (Constraint), residual
   reproductive lifespan (Restraint), or somatic and reproductive
   investment (Senescence). Studies tend to focus on either the initial
   increase in breeding success or later decrease; however, both require
   consideration when unravelling the underlying evolutionary processes.
   Additionally, few studies present genetic fitness measures and rarely
   for both sexes. We therefore test these four hypotheses, which are not
   mutually exclusive, in a high-density population of European badgers
   Meles meles. Using an 18-year data set (including 22 microsatellite
   loci), we show an initial improvement in breeding success with age,
   followed by a later and steeper rate of reproductive senescence in male
   than in female badgers. Breeding success was skewed within age-classes,
   indicating the influence of factors other than age-class. This was
   partly attributable to selective appearance and disappearance of badgers
   (Selection Hypothesis). Individuals with a late age of last breeding
   showed a concave-down relationship between breeding success and
   experience (Constraint Hypothesis). There was no evidence of abrupt
   terminal effects; rather, individuals showed a concave-down relationship
   between breeding success and residual reproductive lifespan (Restraint
   Hypothesis), with an interaction with age of first breeding only in
   female badgers. Our results demonstrate the importance of investigating
   a comprehensive suite of factors in age-specific breeding success
   analyses, in both sexes, to fully understand evolutionary and population
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The study of host-parasite relationships involving vector-borne

   Culicoides and 224 wild birds (belonging to seven species) from a

   Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites by sequencing a fragment of

   were isolated and sequenced. Among them, 10 haplotypes were exclusively
   isolated from biting midges, three haplotypes only from birds and two
   haplotypes from both biting midges and birds. Biting midge haplotypes
   showed both specific and generalist relationships with Haemoproteus
   haplotypes but only generalist relationships with Plasmodium haplotypes.
   Several C. festivipennis and C. kibunesis haplotypes established
   significant coevolutionary links with Haemoproteus haplotypes. These
   results shed light on the specificity of interactions between vectors
   and blood parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular species recognition of fungi emerged years before DNA
   barcoding (Seifert 2009). While the ideal fungal DNA barcode seems
   Utopian, two research decades nevertheless highlight the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) as the best available choice (Seifert 2009).
   Databases providing reliable ITS sequences of known fungi require
   enormous efforts, but are urgently needed (Abarenkov et al. 2010a,b;
   Begerow et al. 2010). Any criticism of such a commitment seems
   unjustified. However, exclusive focus on the development of ITS
   reference libraries will delay the progress towards a deeper ecological
   insight. It is widely acknowledged that ITS fails to recognize species,
   particularly in some ascomycete lineages (Balajee et al. 2009; Seifert
   2009). It also appears paradoxical to solely rely on ITS for ecological
   recognition of fungal species when modern fungal systematics rely on
   phylogenetic species recognition with concordance of multiple gene
   genealogies (see Blackwell 2011). Considering that at least 98\% of the
   predicted similar to 5 million fungal species remain undescribed
   (Blackwell 2011), how will reliance on ITS alone influence the
   biodiversity estimates and ecological understanding? In this issue,
   Gazis et al. (2011) elegantly demonstrate through multi-locus sequence
   phylogeny analyses that ITS largely underestimates the species diversity
   of tropical fungal endophytes and even more importantly obscures
   fundamental ecological and biogeographical patterns. This thorough
   reflection on species delimitation criteria and their implications for
   ecological and biogeographical inferences underline that ITS,
   particularly in hyperdiverse habitats, provides no shortcut to deeper
   knowledge of fungal ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike in the laboratory, in nature fungi are exposed to antagonists
   including competitors, pathogens, parasites and predators. In this issue
   of Molecular Ecology, an exciting paper by Bleuler-Martinez et al.
   (2011) has unearthed on one of the processes used by fungi to protect
   themselves against animal antagonists. The authors from Markus Kunzler's
   group at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland present direct evidence that
   filamentous fungi possess an inducible resistance mechanism against
   predators and parasites. This is based on cytoplasmic lectins, which
   specifically bind to glycans of these predators and parasites, and thus
   provide toxicity against them. These lectins are expressed at high
   levels in fruiting bodies and sclerotia of these fungi (Fig. 1). While
   there have been previous suggestions and efforts to implicate mycotoxins
   such as sterigmatocystin into fungal defence mechanisms and as an
   evolutionary force (see Kempken \& Rohlfs 2010), the data presented by
   Markus Kunzler's group highlight the ecological relevance of lectins in
   defending fungi from parasites and fungivorous animals. As such this
   paper provides important ecological clues and suggests that secondary
   metabolites are not the sole player in fungal-animal competition. It
   rather appears that fungi have evolved several lines of defence against
   antagonistic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral populations are those situated at the distribution margins of
   a species and are often subjected to more extreme abiotic and biotic
   conditions than those at the core. Here, we hypothesized that shorter

   related to improved survival under extreme environmental conditions. We
   sampled eastern spadefoot toads (mostly as tadpoles) from 43 rain pools
   distributed along a 300-km gradient from core to edge of the species'
   distribution. We show that mean pool tandem repeat length and
   heteroplasmy increase from edge to core, even after controlling for body
   size. We evaluate several alternative hypotheses and propose the Fisher
   hypothesis as the most likely explanation. However, additional
   sequential sampling and experimental studies are required to determine
   whether selection under extreme conditions, or alternative mechanisms,
   could account for the gradient in heteroplasmy and repeat length in the

Abstract = {{Four British bumblebee species (Bombus terrestris, Bombus hortorum,
   Bombus ruderatus and Bombus subterraneus) became established in New
   Zealand following their introduction at the turn of the last century. Of
   these, two remain common in the United Kingdom (B. terrestris and B.
   hortorum), whilst two (B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus) have undergone
   marked declines, the latter being declared extinct in 2000. The presence
   of these bumblebees in New Zealand provides an unique system in which
   four related species have been isolated from their source population for
   over 100 years, providing a rare opportunity to examine the impacts of
   an initial bottleneck and introduction to a novel environment on their
   population genetics. We used microsatellite markers to compare modern
   populations of B. terrestris, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus in the United
   Kingdom and New Zealand and to compare museum specimens of British B.
   subterraneus with the current New Zealand population. We used
   approximate Bayesian computation to estimate demographic parameters of
   the introduction history, notably to estimate the number of founders
   involved in the initial introduction. Species-specific patterns derived
   from genetic analysis were consistent with the predictions based on the
   presumed history of these populations; demographic events have left a
   marked genetic signature on all four species. Approximate Bayesian
   analyses suggest that the New Zealand population of B. subterraneus may
   have been founded by as few as two individuals, giving rise to low
   genetic diversity and marked genetic divergence from the (now extinct)
   UK population.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing the phylogenetic and demographic history of rare plants
   improves our understanding of mechanisms that have led to their origin
   and can lead to valuable insights that inform conservation decisions.
   The Atlantic coastal plain of eastern North America harbours many rare
   and endemic species, yet their evolution is poorly understood. We
   investigate the rare Sandhills lily (Lilium pyrophilum), which is
   endemic to seepage slopes in a restricted area of the Atlantic coastal
   plain of eastern North America. Using phylogenetic evidence from
   chloroplast, nuclear internal transcribed spacer and two low-copy
   nuclear genes, we establish a close relationship between L. pyrophilum
   and the widespread Turk's cap lily, L. superbum.
   Isolation-with-migration and coalescent simulation analyses suggest that
   (i) the divergence between these two species falls in the late
   Pleistocene or Holocene and almost certainly post-dates the
   establishment of the edaphic conditions to which L. pyrophilum is
   presently restricted, (ii) vicariance is responsible for the present
   range disjunction between the two species, and that subsequent gene flow
   has been asymmetrical and (iii) L. pyrophilum harbours substantial
   genetic diversity in spite of its present rarity. This system provides
   an example of the role of edaphic specialization and climate change in
   promoting diversification in the Atlantic coastal plain.}},

Abstract = {{Information about the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in wild
   animal populations is still limited, and this is true particularly with
   respect to possible interpopulation variation in the levels of LD. We
   compared the levels and extent of LD at the genome-wide scale in three
   Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) populations, two of which (Kuusamo
   and Yllas) represented outbred populations within the main distribution
   area of the species, whereas the third (Suupohja) was a semi-isolated,
   partially inbred population at the margin of the species' distribution
   area. Although extensive long-range LD (>20 cM) was observed in all
   three populations, LD generally decayed to background levels at a
   distance of 1-5 cM or c. 200-600 kb. The degree and extent of LD
   differed markedly between populations but aligned closely with both
   observed levels of within-population genetic variation and expectations
   based on population history. The levels of LD were highest in the most
   inbred population with strong population substructure (Suupohja),
   compared with the two outbred populations. Furthermore, the decay of LD
   with increasing distance was slower in Suupohja, compared with the other
   two populations. By demonstrating that levels of LD can vary greatly
   over relatively short geographical distances within a species, these
   results suggest that prospects for association mapping differ from
   population to population. In this example, the prospects are best in the
   Suupohja population, given that minimized marker genotyping and a
   minimum marker spacing of 1-5 cM (c. 200-600 kb) would be sufficient for
   a whole genome scan for detecting QTL.}},

Abstract = {{Latitudinal variation in thermal reaction norms of key fitness traits
   may inform about the response of populations to climate warming, yet
   their adaptive nature and evolutionary potential are poorly known. We
   assessed the contribution of quantitative genetic, neutral genetic and
   environmental effects to thermal reaction norms of growth rate for
   populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Among populations,
   reaction norms differed primarily in elevation, suggesting that time
   constraints associated with shorter growth seasons in univoltine,
   high-latitude as well as multivoltine, low-latitude populations selected
   for faster growth rates. Phenotypic divergence among populations is
   consistent with selection rather than drift as Q(ST) was greater than
   F-ST in all cases. Q(ST) estimates increased with experimental
   temperature and were influenced by genotype by environment interactions.
   Substantial additive genetic variation for growth rate in all
   populations suggests that evolution of trait means in different
   environments is not constrained. Heritability of growth rates was higher
   at high temperature, driven by increased genetic rather than
   environmental variance. While environment-specific nonadditive effects
   also may contribute to heritability differences among temperatures,
   maternal effects did not play a significant role (where these could be
   accounted for). Genotype by environment interactions strongly influenced
   the adaptive potential of populations, and our results suggest the
   potential for microevolution of thermal reaction norms in each of the
   studied populations. In summary, the observed latitudinal pattern in
   growth rates is adaptive and results from a combination of latitudinal
   and voltinism compensation. Combined with the evolutionary potential of
   thermal reaction norms, this may affect populations' ability to respond
   to future climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{Mass mortality events occur in natural and cultured communities of
   bivalve molluscs. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is a dominant
   species in many intertidal locations as well as an important
   aquacultured bivalve species, and for the last 50 years, adult oysters
   have suffered frequent and extreme mass mortality events during summer
   months. To investigate the molecular changes that precede these
   mortality events, we employed a novel nonlethal sampling approach to
   collect haemolymph samples from individual oysters during the period
   that preceded a mortality event. Microarray-based gene expression
   screening of the collected haemolymph was used to identify a mortality
   gene expression signature that distinguished oysters that survived the
   mortality event from those individuals that died during the event. The
   signature was cross-validated by comparing two separate episodes of
   mortality. Here, we report that near-mortality oysters can be
   distinguished from longer-lived oysters by the elevated expression of
   genes associated with cell death, lysosomal proteolysis, and cellular
   assembly and organization. These results show the potential utility of
   nonlethal sampling approaches for investigating the environmental causes
   of mortality in natural populations in the field, and for predicting
   when such events could occur and which individuals will be affected.}},

Abstract = {{Scleractinian corals are the major builders of the complex structural
   framework of coral reefs. They live in tropical waters around the globe
   where they are frequently exposed to potentially harmful ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR). The eggs and early embryonic stages of some coral
   species are highly buoyant and remain near the sea surface for prolonged
   periods of time and may therefore be the most sensitive life stages with
   respect to UVR. Here, we analysed gene expression changes in five
   developmental stages of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata to
   natural levels of UVR using high-density cDNA microarrays (10 930
   clones). We found that larvae exhibit low sensitivity to natural levels
   of UVR during early development as reflected by comparatively few
   transcriptomic changes in response to UVR. However, we identified a time
   window of high UVR sensitivity that coincides with the motile planula
   stage and the onset of larval competence. These processes have been
   shown to be affected by UVR exposure, and the transcriptional changes we
   identified explain these observations well. Our analysis of
   differentially expressed genes indicates that UVR alters the expression
   of genes associated with stress response, the endoplasmic reticulum,
   Ca(2+) homoeostasis, development and apoptosis during the motile planula
   stage and affects the expression of neurogenesis-related genes that are
   linked to swimming and settlement behaviour at later stages. Taken
   together, our study provides further data on the impact of natural
   levels of UVR on coral larvae. Furthermore, our results might allow a
   better prediction of settlement and recruitment rates after coral
   spawning events if UVR climate data are taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection can generate parallel latitudinal clines in traits and
   gene frequencies across continents, but these have rarely been linked.
   An amino acid (isoleucine to lysine, or I462K) polymorphism of the couch
   potato (cpo) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is thought to control
   female reproductive diapause cline in North America (Schmidt et al.
   2008, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, 16207-16211). Here, we show that
   under standard diapause-inducing conditions (12 degrees C and short
   photoperiod) (Saunders et al. 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86,
   3748-3752), egg maturation in Australian flies is delayed, but not
   arrested at previtellogenic stages. At 12 degrees C, the phenotypic
   distribution in egg development was bimodal at stages 8 and 14 and
   showed a strong nonlinear pattern on the east coast of Australia, with
   incidence of egg maturation delay (ovarian dormancy) increasing both
   toward tropical and temperate climates. Furthermore, we found no
   evidence for an association between the cpo I462K polymorphism and
   ovarian dormancy at either 12 or 10 degrees C (when egg maturation was
   often delayed at stage 7). Owing to strong linkage disequilibrium, the
   latitudinal cline in cpo allele frequencies was no longer evident once
   variation in the In(3R) P inversion polymorphism was taken into account.
   Our results suggest that the standard diapause-inducing conditions (12
   degrees C and short photoperiod) were not sufficient to cause the
   typical previtellogenic developmental arrest in Australian flies and
   that the cpo I462K polymorphism does not explain the observed delay in
   egg development. In conclusion, ovarian dormancy does not show a simple
   latitudinal cline, and the lack of cpo-dormancy association suggests a
   different genetic basis to reproductive dormancy in North America and
   Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that naturally occurring hybrid zones between
   genetically distinct taxa can move over space and time as a result of
   selection and/or demographic processes, with certain types of hybrid
   zones being more or less likely to move. Determining whether a hybrid
   zone is stationary or moving has important implications for
   understanding evolutionary processes affecting interactions in hybrid
   populations. However, direct observations of hybrid zone movement are
   difficult to make unless the zone is moving rapidly. Here, evidence for
   movement in the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus x Mus musculus
   musculus hybrid zone is provided using measures of LD and haplotype
   structure among neighbouring SNP markers from across the genome. Local
   populations of mice across two transects in Germany and the Czech
   Republic were sampled, and a total of 1301 mice were genotyped at 1401
   markers from the nuclear genome. Empirical measures of LD provide
   evidence for extinction and ( re) colonization in single populations
   and, together with simulations, suggest hybrid zone movement because of
   either geography-dependent asymmetrical dispersal or selection favouring
   one subspecies over the other.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of species diversity in fungal endophyte communities is
   based either on species counts or on the assignment of operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). Consequently, the application of different
   species recognition criteria affects not only diversity estimates but
   also the ecological hypotheses that arise from those observations. The
   main objective of the study was to examine how the choice and number of
   genetic markers and species delimitation criteria influence biodiversity
   estimates. Here, we compare approaches to defining species boundaries in
   three dominant species complexes of tropical endophytes, specially
   Colletotrichum gloeosporioides agg., Pestalotiopsis microspora agg. and
   Trichoderma harzianum agg., from two Amazonian trees: Hevea brasiliensis
   and H. guianensis. Molecular tools were used to describe and compare the
   diversity of the different assemblages. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses
   {[}gpd, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and tef1] and modern
   techniques for phylogenetic species delimitation were overlaid with
   ecological data to recognize putative species or OTUs. The results
   demonstrate that ITS alone generally underestimates the number of
   species predicted by other nuclear loci. These results question the use
   of ITS and arbitrary divergence thresholds for species delimitation.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the Quaternary ice ages in forming the contemporary genetic
   structure of populations has been well studied in a number of global
   regions. However, due to the different nature of glaciations and complex
   topography, their role in shaping eastern Eurasian genetic diversity,
   particular in areas surrounding the Tibetan Plateau have remained
   largely unstudied. We aimed to address this question by examining the
   genetic structure of an alpine forest-associated taxon, the blood
   pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus) to infer its phylogeographic history. We
   detected three phylogenetic lineages and four current population groups.
   By comparing molecular and palaeovegetation data, we found that major
   glaciations during the Pleistocene have had a major impact upon the
   current genetic diversity of this species. Coalescent simulations
   indicate that the populations retreated to different refugia during some
   glacial periods in the Pleistocene, but persisted through the last
   glacial maximum (LGM). The most significant recent population expansion
   was found to have occurred before the LGM, during which palaeoclimatic
   data indicate that the climate was both warmer and wetter than today. In
   contrast, during the LGM populations may have adopted an altitudinal
   shift strategy in order to track changes in alpine glaciers,
   exemplifying a general response for montane species in the region where
   alpine glaciations were not large enough to cause qualitative changes in
   vegetation. Although analysis based on a plumage related gene showed
   that divergent selection may have contributed to current patterns of
   intra-specific diversity, demographic isolation is inferred to have
   played a more dominant role.}},

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal patterns and processes of genetic differentiation in
   passively dispersing zooplankton are drawing much attention from both
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Two opposite phylogeographical
   scenarios have already been demonstrated in rotifers, which consist of
   high levels of genetic differentiation among populations even on small
   geographical scales on the one hand and the traditionally known
   cosmopolitanism that is associated with high levels of gene flow and
   long-distance dispersal via diapausing stages on the other hand. Here,
   we analysed the population genetic structure and the phylogeography of
   the Brachionus calyciflorus species complex in eastern China. By
   screening a total of 318 individuals from ten locations along a 2320-km
   gradient and analysing samples from two growing seasons, we aimed at
   focusing on both small-and large-scale patterns. We identified eight
   cryptic species and verified species status of two of these by sexual
   reproduction tests. Samples in summer and winter yielded different
   cryptic species. The distribution patterns of these genetically distinct
   cryptic species were diverse across eastern China, from full
   cosmopolitanism to local endemism. The two most abundant cryptic species
   BcWIII and BcSW showed a pattern of strong genetic differentiation among
   populations and no significant isolation by distance. Long-distance
   colonization, secondary contact and recent range expansion are probably
   responsible for the indistinct pattern of isolation by distance. Our
   results suggest that geographical distance is more important than
   temporal segregation across seasons in explaining population
   differentiation and the occurrence of cryptic species. We explain the
   current phylogeographical structure in the B. calyciflorus species
   complex by a combination of recent population expansion, restricted gene
   flow, priority effects and long-distance colonization.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological and evolutionary importance of fine-scale genetic
   structure within populations is increasingly appreciated. However,
   available data are largely restricted to wild vertebrates and eusocial
   insects. In addition, there is the expectation that most insects tend to
   have such large- and high-density populations and are so mobile that
   they are unlikely to face inbreeding risks through fine-scale population
   structuring. This has made the growing body of evidence for inbreeding
   avoidance in insects and its implication in mating systems evolution
   somewhat enigmatic. We present a 4-year study of a natural population of
   field crickets. Using detailed video monitoring combined with
   genotyping, we track the movement of all adults within the population
   and investigate genetic structure at a fine scale. We find some evidence
   for relatives being found in closer proximity, both across generations
   and within a single breeding season. Whilst incestuous matings are not
   avoided, population inbreeding is low, suggesting that mating is close
   to random and the limited fine-scale structure does not create
   significant inbreeding risk. Hence, there is little evidence for
   selective pressures associated with the evolution of inbreeding
   avoidance mechanisms in a closely related species.}},

Abstract = {{Fruiting body lectins are ubiquitous in higher fungi and characterized
   by being synthesized in the cytoplasm and up-regulated during sexual
   development. The function of these lectins is unclear. A lack of
   phenotype in sexual development upon inactivation of the respective
   genes argues against a function in this process. We tested a series of
   characterized fruiting body lectins from different fungi for toxicity
   towards the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mosquito Aedes aegypti
   and the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. Most of the fungal lectins were
   found to be toxic towards at least one of the three target organisms. By
   altering either the fungal lectin or the glycans of the target
   organisms, or by including soluble carbohydrate ligands as competitors,
   we demonstrate that the observed toxicity is dependent on the
   interaction between the fungal lectins and specific glycans in the
   target organisms. The toxicity was found to be dose-dependent such that
   low levels of lectin were no longer toxic but still led to food
   avoidance by C. elegans. Finally, we show, in an ecologically more
   relevant scenario, that challenging the vegetative mycelium of
   Coprinopsis cinerea with the fungal-feeding nematode Aphelenchus avenae
   induces the expression of the nematotoxic fruiting body lectins CGL1 and
   CGL2. Based on these findings, we propose that filamentous fungi possess
   an inducible resistance against predators and parasites mediated by
   lectins that are specific for glycans of these antagonists.}},

Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungi play a key role in mineral nutrition of terrestrial
   plants, but the factors affecting natural distribution, diversity and
   community composition of particularly tropical fungi remain poorly
   understood. This study addresses shifts in community structure and
   species frequency of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi in relation to host
   taxa, soil depth and spatial structure in four contrasting African
   ecosystems. We used the rDNA and plastid trnL intron sequence analysis
   for identification of fungi and host plants, respectively. By
   partitioning out spatial autocorrelation in plant and fungal
   distribution, we suggest that African EcM fungal communities are little
   structured by soil horizon and host at the plant species and family
   levels. These findings contrast with patterns of vegetation in these
   forests and EcM fungal communities in other tropical and temperate
   ecosystems. The low level of host preference indirectly supports an
   earlier hypothesis that pioneer Phyllanthaceae may facilitate the
   establishment of late successional Fabaceae and potentially other EcM
   host trees by providing compatible fungal inoculum in deforested and
   naturally disturbed ecosystems of tropical Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Social monogamy is nearly ubiquitous across avian taxa, but evidence
   from a proliferation of studies utilizing molecular paternity analysis
   suggests that sexual monogamy is the rare exception rather than the rule
   (Griffith et al. 2002). Efforts to explain the prevalence of extra-pair
   paternity (EPP) have largely focused on the potential fitness benefits
   for offspring genetic quality, as females are less likely to benefit
   directly from seeking extra-pair mates. In particular, there has been
   considerable interest in the degree to which EPP may represent an
   adaptive female strategy to avoid inbreeding (or outbreeding) depression
   when paired with a highly related (or unrelated) social mate (Kempenaers
   2007). Others have argued that, because relatives share many genes
   identical by descent, females might increase their own inclusive fitness
   by providing additional breeding opportunities to genetically related
   males (Waser et al. 1986; Kokko \& Ots 2006). Thus, in the absence of
   significant inbreeding depression, pursuing EPP with relatives should be
   favoured by kin selection, although there exist few unambiguous
   empirical examples of such preferences in the literature. In this issue
   of Molecular Ecology, Wang \& Lu (2011) present an analysis of mating
   patterns with respect to genetic relatedness of social and extra-pair
   partners in the ground tit (Parus humilis), a facultative cooperative
   breeder in which socially monogamous pairs occasionally form cooperative
   groups with unpaired helper males (Fig. 1). Consistent with the
   predictions of the kin-selection hypothesis, females in both bi-parental
   and cooperative groups preferentially engaged in extra-pair matings with
   relatives, irrespective of relatedness to their social mates, and while
   suffering no apparent costs of inbreeding depression in their progeny.
   These findings have several exciting implications for our understanding
   of avian mating system diversity and the evolution of cooperative

Abstract = {{Clarification of the genetic structure and population history of a
   species can shed light on the impacts of landscapes, historical climate
   change and contemporary human activities and thus enables evidence-based
   conservation decisions for endangered organisms. The red panda (Ailurus
   fulgens) is an endangered species distributing at the edge of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and is currently subject to habitat loss,
   fragmentation and population decline, thus representing a good model to
   test the influences of the above-mentioned factors on a plateau edge
   species. We combined nine microsatellite loci and 551 bp of
   mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) to explore the genetic structure
   and demographic history of this species. A total of 123 individuals were
   sampled from 23 locations across five populations. High levels of
   genetic variation were identified for both mtDNA and microsatellites.
   Phylogeographic analyses indicated little geographic structure,
   suggesting historically wide gene flow. However, microsatellite-based
   Bayesian clustering clearly identified three groups (Qionglai-Liangshan,
   Xiaoxiangling and Gaoligong-Tibet). A significant isolation-by-distance
   pattern was detected only after removing Xiaoxiangling. For mtDNA data,
   there was no statistical support for a historical population expansion
   or contraction for the whole sample or any population except
   Xiaoxiangling where a signal of contraction was detected. However,
   Bayesian simulations of population history using microsatellite data did
   pinpoint population declines for Qionglai, Xiaoxiangling and Gaoligong,
   demonstrating significant influences of human activity on demography.
   The unique history of the Xiaoxiangling population plays a critical role
   in shaping the genetic structure of this species, and large-scale
   habitat loss and fragmentation is hampering gene flow among populations.
   The implications of our findings for the biogeography of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, subspecies classification and conservation of
   red pandas are discussed.}},

Title = {{Genetic differentiation across North America in the generalist moth

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The two moth species Heliothis virescens (Hv) and H. subflexa (Hs) are
   closely related, but have vastly different feeding habits. Hv is a
   generalist and an important pest in many crops in the USA, while Hs is a
   specialist feeding only on plants in the genus Physalis. In this study,
   we conducted a comparative population genetic analysis to assess whether
   and how generalist and specialist life styles are reflected in
   differences in population structures. In Hv 98\% of the total variation
   occurred within populations. The overall differentiation (F-ST) between
   regions was 0.006 and even lower between years (0.0039) and hosts
   (0.0028). Analyses of population structure suggest that all individuals
   form one genetically homogeneous population, except for at most 12
   individuals (6\%) that diverged from this cluster. Population
   homogeneity likely results from the high mobility of Hv and its
   generalist feeding behaviour. Hs exhibited substantially more population
   structure. Even though 96\% of the total variation was attributable to
   within-population variability, F-ST-values between Hs populations were
   10 times higher than between Hv populations. Hs populations showed
   significant isolation by distance. Analyses of Hs population structure
   suggest at least two subpopulations and thus some degree of
   metapopulation structure. We speculate that the patchy distribution of
   Physalis - the exclusive food source of Hs - contributes to differences
   in population structure between these closely related species. The
   finding that the specialist shows more population differentiation than
   the generalist corroborates the notion that host specialization is not
   an evolutionary dead end but a dynamic trait.}},

Abstract = {{The current distribution of Bantu languages is commonly considered to be
   a consequence of a relatively recent population expansion (3-5 kya) in
   Central Western Africa. While there is a substantial consensus regarding
   the centre of origin of Bantu languages (the Benue River Valley, between
   South East Nigeria and Western Cameroon), the identification of the area
   from where the population expansion actually started, the relation
   between the processes leading to the spread of languages and peoples and
   the relevance of local migratory events remain controversial. In order
   to shed new light on these aspects, we studied Y chromosome variation in
   a broad dataset of populations encompassing Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and
   Congo. Our results evidence an evolutionary scenario which is more
   complex than had been previously thought, pointing to a marked
   differentiation of Cameroonian populations from the rest of the dataset.
   In fact, in contrast with the current view of Bantu speakers as a
   homogeneous group of populations, we observed an unexpectedly high level
   of interpopulation genetic heterogeneity and highlighted previously
   undetected diversity for lineages associated with the diffusion of Bantu
   languages (E1b1a (M2) sub-branches). We also detected substantial
   differences in local demographic histories, which concord with the
   hypotheses regarding an early diffusion of Bantu languages into the
   forest area and a subsequent demographic expansion and migration towards
   eastern and western Africa.}},

Abstract = {{While information about a species' demography is interesting in its own
   right, it is an absolute necessity for certain types of population
   genetic analyses. The most widely used methods to infer a species'
   demographic history do not take intralocus recombination or recent
   divergence into account, and some methods take several weeks to
   converge. Here, we present Jaatha, a new composite-likelihood method
   that does incorporate recent divergence and is also applicable when
   intralocus recombination rates are high. This new method estimates four
   demographic parameters. The accuracy of Jaatha is comparable to that of
   other currently available methods, although it is superior under certain
   conditions, especially when divergence is very recent. As a proof of
   concept, we apply this new method to estimate demographic parameters for
   two closely related wild tomato species, Solanum chilense and S.
   peruvianum. Our results indicate that these species likely diverged
   1.44.N generations ago, where N is the effective population size of S.
   chilense, and that some introgression between these species continued
   after the divergence process initiated. Furthermore, S. peruvianum
   likely experienced a population expansion following speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive genetic variation is a key factor in evolutionary biology, but
   the detection of signatures of natural selection remains challenging in
   nonmodel organisms. We used a genome scan approach to detect signals of
   natural selection in the Black alder (Alnus glutinosa), a widespread
   wind-pollinated tree. Gene flow through pollen dispersal is believed to
   be high in this species, and we therefore expected to find a clear
   response to natural selection. In combination with two different
   landscape genetic approaches, we determined which environmental
   variables were most associated with the inferred selection. This
   analysis was performed on a regional scale (northern Belgium) and on a
   continental scale (Europe). Because climate-related differences are much
   more pronounced at the continental scale, we expected to find more
   selection-sensitive genetic markers across Europe than across northern
   Belgium. At both spatial scales, a substantial number of genetic loci
   were considered outliers, with respect to neutral expectations, and were
   therefore identified as selective. Based on results from our combined
   approach, four putative selective loci (or 2.5\%) were recovered with
   high statistical support. Although these loci seemed to be associated
   with different environmental variables, they were mainly
   temperature-related. Our study demonstrates that the use of
   complementary methods in landscape genetics allows the discovery of
   selective loci which otherwise might stay hidden. In combination with a
   genome scan, the selective loci can be verified and the nature of the
   selection pressure can be identified.}},

   structure of a plant pathogenic fungus collected on its wild host can be
   impacted by the deployment of resistant cultivars. We studied one of the
   main poplar diseases, poplar rust, caused by the fungus Melampsora
   larici-populina. A thousand and fifty individuals sampled from several
   locations in France were pheno-typed for their virulence profile
   (ability to infect or not the most deployed resistant cultivar
   `Beaupre'), and a subset of these was genotyped using 25 microsatellite
   markers. Bayesian assignment tests on genetic data clustered the 476
   genotyped individuals into three genetic groups. Group 1 gathered most
   virulent individuals and displayed evidence for selection and drastic
   demographic changes resulting from breakdown of the poplar cultivar
   `Beaupre'. Group 2 comprised individuals corresponding to ancestral
   populations of M. larici-populina naturally occurring in the native
   range. Group 3 displayed the hallmarks of strict asexual reproduction,
   which has never previously been demonstrated in this species. We discuss
   how poplar cultivation has influenced the spatial and genetic structure
   of this plant pathogenic fungus, and has led to the spread of virulence
   alleles (gene swamping) in M. larici-populina populations evolving on
   the wild host.}},

Abstract = {{The paucity of fungal species known to be currently hybridizing has
   significantly hindered our understanding of the mechanisms driving gene
   introgression in these eukaryotic microbes. Here, we describe an area of
   hybridization and gene introgression between the invasive plant pathogen
   Heterobasidion irregulare (introduced from North America) and the native
   H. annosum in Italy. A STRUCTURE analysis of amplified fragment length
   polymorphism data for 267 individuals identified gene introgression in
   8-42\% of genotypes in the invasion area, depending on site. Data
   indicate that introgression is mostly occurring unilaterally from the
   native to the invasive species and is responsible for 5-45\% of genomes
   in admixed individuals. Sequence analysis of 11 randomly selected and
   unlinked loci for 30 individuals identified introgression at every
   locus, thus confirming interspecific gene flow involves a large number
   of loci. In 37 cases, we documented movement of entire alleles between
   the two species, but in 7 cases, we also documented the creation of new
   alleles through intralocus recombination. Sequence analysis did not
   identify enrichment of either transcriptionally different nonsynonymous
   alleles or of transcriptionally identical synonymous alleles. These
   findings may suggest introgression is occurring randomly for extant
   alleles without an obvious enrichment process driven by selection.
   However, further studies are needed to ensure selection is not at work
   elsewhere in the genome.}},

Abstract = {{In the spirit of recent calls for species delimitation studies to become
   more pluralistic, incorporating multiple sources of evidence, we adopted
   an integrative, phylogeographic approach to delimiting species and
   evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) in the Corallorhiza striata
   species complex. This rare, North American, mycoheterotrophic orchid has
   been a taxonomic challenge regarding species boundaries, displaying
   complex patterns of variation and reduced vegetative morphology. We
   employed plastid DNA, nuclear DNA and morphometrics, treating the C.
   striata complex as a case study for integrative species delimitation. We
   found evidence for the differentiation of the endangered C. bentleyi
   (eastern USA) + C. striata var. involuta (Mexico) from the remaining C.
   striata (= C. striata s.s.; USA, Canada, Mexico). Corallorhiza striata
   involuta and C. bentleyi, disjunct by thousands of kilometres
   (Mexico-Appalachia), were genetically identical but morphologically
   distinct. Evidence suggests the C. striata complex represents three
   species: C. bentleyi, C. involuta and a widespread C. striata s.s under
   operational criteria of diagnosability and common allele pools. In
   contrast, Bayesian coalescent estimation delimited four species, but
   more informative loci and a resultant species tree will be needed to
   place higher confidence in future analyses. Three distinct groupings
   were identified within C. striata s.s., corresponding to C. striata
   striata, C. striata vreelandii, and Californian accessions, but these
   were not delimited as species because of occupying a common allele pool.
   Each comprises an ESU, warranting conservation considerations. This
   study represents perhaps the most geographically comprehensive example
   of integrative species delimitation for any orchid and any
   mycoheterotroph.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation with gene flow may be more common than generally thought,
   which makes detailed understanding of the extent and pattern of genetic
   divergence between geographically isolated populations useful. Species
   of the Drosophila simulans complex provide a good model for speciation
   and evolutionary studies, and hence understanding their population
   genetic structure will increase our understanding of the context in
   which speciation has occurred. Here, we describe genetic diversity and
   genetic differentiation of two distant populations of D. mauritiana
   (Mauritius and Rodrigues Islands) at mitochondrial and nuclear loci. We
   surveyed the two populations for their mitochondrial haplotypes, eight
   nuclear genes and 18 microsatellite loci. A new mitochondrial type is
   fixed in the Rodrigues population of D. mauritiana. The two populations
   are highly differentiated, their divergence appears relatively ancient
   (100 000 years) compared to the origin of the species, around 0.25 MYA,
   and they exhibit very limited gene flow. However, they have similar
   levels of divergence from their sibling, D. simulans. Both nuclear genes
   and microsatellites revealed contrasting demographic histories between
   the two populations, expansion for the Mauritius population and stable
   population size for the Rodrigues Island population. The discovery of
   pronounced geographic structure within D. mauritiana combined to genetic
   structuring and low gene flow between the two island populations
   illuminates the evolutionary history of the species and clearly merits
   further attention in the broad context of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Drosophila quinaria is polymorphic for infection with Wolbachia, a
   maternally transmitted endosymbiont. Wolbachia-infected individuals
   carry mtDNA that is only distantly related to the mtDNA of uninfected
   individuals, and the clade encompassing all mtDNA haplotypes within D.
   quinaria also includes the mtDNA of several other species of Drosophila.
   Nuclear gene variation reveals no difference between the
   Wolbachia-infected and uninfected individuals of D. quinaria, indicating
   that they all belong to the same interbreeding biological species. We
   suggest that the Wolbachia and the mtDNA with which it is associated
   were derived via interspecific hybridization and introgression. The
   sequences in the Wolbachia and the associated mtDNA are >= 6\% divergent
   from those of any known Drosophila species. Thus, in spite of nearly
   complete species sampling, the sequences from which these mitochondria
   were derived remain unknown, raising the possibility that the donor
   species is extinct. The association between Wolbachia infection and
   mtDNA type within D. quinaria suggests that Wolbachia may be required
   for the continued persistence of the mtDNA from an otherwise extinct
   Drosophila species. We hypothesize that pathogen-protective effects
   conferred by Wolbachia operate in a negative frequency-dependent manner,
   thus bringing about a stable polymorphism for Wolbachia infection.}},

Title = {{Is sexual selection driving diversification of the bioluminescent
   ponyfishes (Teleostei: Leiognathidae)?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{13}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection may facilitate genetic isolation among populations and
   result in increased rates of diversification. As a mechanism driving
   diversification, sexual selection has been invoked and upheld in
   numerous empirical studies across disparate taxa, including birds,
   plants and spiders. In this study, we investigate the potential impact
   of sexual selection on the tempo and mode of ponyfish evolution.
   Ponyfishes (Leiognathidae) are bioluminescent marine fishes that exhibit
   sexually dimorphic features of their unique light-organ system (LOS).
   Although sexual selection is widely considered to be the driving force
   behind ponyfish speciation, this hypothesis has never been formally
   tested. Given that some leiognathid species have a sexually dimorphic
   LOS, whereas others do not, this family provides an excellent system
   within which to study the potential role of sexual selection in
   diversification and morphological differentiation. In this study, we
   estimate the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times for
   Leiognathidae, investigate the tempo and mode of ponyfish
   diversification, and explore morphological shape disparity among
   leiognathid clades. We recover strong support for a monophyletic
   Leiognathidae and estimate that all major ponyfish lineages evolved
   during the Paleogene. Our studies of ponyfish diversification
   demonstrate that there is no conclusive evidence that sexually dimorphic
   clades are significantly more species rich than nonsexually dimorphic
   lineages and that evidence is lacking to support any significant
   diversification rate increases within ponyfishes. Further, we detected a
   lineage-through-time signal indicating that ponyfishes have continuously
   diversified through time, which is in contrast to many recent
   diversification studies that identify lineage-through-time patterns that
   support mechanisms of density-dependent speciation. Additionally, there
   is no evidence of sexual selection hindering morphological diversity, as
   sexually dimorphic taxa are shown to be more disparate in overall shape
   morphology than nonsexually dimorphic taxa. Our results suggest that if
   sexual selection is occurring in ponyfish evolution, it is likely acting
   only as a genetic isolating mechanism that has allowed ponyfishes to
   continuously diversify over time, with no overall impact on increases in
   diversification rate or morphological disparity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and empirical research suggests that statistical
   models based on coalescent theory can improve both phylogeographic and
   phylogenetic inference. An approach that involves elements of both
   statistical phylogeography (e.g. Isolation with Migration analyses) and
   multilocus phylogenetic inference (e.g. {*}BEAST) may be particularly
   useful when applied to populations with relatively old divergence times.
   Here, we use such an approach in the globally distributed brown booby
   (Sula leucogaster). We sampled 215 individuals from all major breeding
   areas and genotyped them at eight microsatellite and three nuclear
   intron loci. We found that brown booby populations were highly
   differentiated and that colonies can be grouped into four major genetic
   populations (Caribbean Sea, Central Atlantic Ocean, Indo-Central Pacific
   and Eastern Pacific). These populations apparently diverged in the
   absence of gene flow and, with one exception, currently exchange few to
   no migrants. The Eastern Pacific population diverged from all other
   populations approximately one million years ago {[}90\% highest
   posterior density: 330 000-2 000 000 years ago] and exhibits a distinct
   male plumage, relative to other populations. However, recent gene flow
   from the Indo-Central Pacific into the Eastern Pacific appears to have
   occurred, suggesting that approximately one million years of genetic
   isolation and divergence in male plumage colour are not sufficient to
   prevent interbreeding. Gene flow following secondary contact of the
   Indo-Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific populations was not detected in
   previous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies, and the contrast between the
   mtDNA results and our current results highlights the advantage of a
   multilocus phylogeographic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Socially monogamous female birds routinely mate with males outside the
   pair bond. Three alternative hypotheses consider genetic benefits as the
   major driver behind the female strategy. The inbreeding avoidance
   hypothesis predicts that females paired with closely related males
   should seek copulations with distantly related extra-pair partners to
   avoid fitness loss from inbreeding depression; the outbreeding avoidance
   hypothesis predicts the opposite; the kin-selection hypothesis suggests
   that regardless of social mate relatedness, females should give related
   males extra-pair fertilization opportunities to gain inclusive fitness
   if the costs from inbreeding are minor. We test these hypotheses with a
   facultative cooperative breeder, the ground tit (Parus humilis). Social
   pairs of ground tits formed randomly with respect to genetic
   relatedness. In both bi-parental and cooperative groups, a female's
   engaging in extra-pair mating was independent of relatedness to her
   social mate; however, females preferred extra-pair sires to which they
   were more related than to their social mates. Moreover, females had
   higher relatedness with either their extra-group extra-pair sires in
   both bi-parental and cooperative groups, or within-group helper sires in
   cooperative groups, than expected by chance. When more than one
   potential extra-pair partner was available around a female's nest, she
   tended to select a relative. There was no indication of fitness
   reduction from extra-pair mating, which occurred at an intermediate
   level of inbreeding. These data support the kin-selection hypothesis,
   although there might be alternative nongenetic reasons associated with
   the extra-pair mating preference. Our finding offers a new explanation
   for why female birds pursue extra-pair mating. It also may broaden our
   understanding of the role of kin-selection in the evolution of
   cooperative society.}},

Abstract = {{Bartonella are emerging and re-emerging pathogens affecting humans and a
   wide variety of animals including rodents. Horizontal transmission of
   Bartonella species by different hematophagous vectors is well
   acknowledged but vertical transmission (from mother to offspring) is
   questionable and was never explored in fleas. The aim of this study was
   to investigate whether the rodent flea, Xenopsylla ramesis, can acquire
   native Bartonella from wild rodents and transmit it transovarially. For
   this aim, Bartonella-free laboratory-reared X. ramesis fleas were placed
   on six naturally Bartonella-infected rodents and six species-matched
   Bartonella-negative rodents (three Meriones crassus jirds, two Gerbillus
   nanus gerbils and one Gerbillus dasyurus gerbil) for 7 days, 12-14 h per
   day. The fleas that were placed on the Bartonella-positive rodents
   acquired four different Bartonella genotypes. Eggs and larvae laid and
   developed, respectively, by fleas from both rodent groups were collected
   daily for 7 days and molecularly screened for Bartonella. All eggs and
   larvae from both groups were found to be negative for Bartonella DNA.
   Interestingly, two of five gut voids regurgitated by Bartonella-positive
   fleas contained Bartonella DNA. The naturally infected rodents remained
   persistently infected with Bartonella for at least 89 days suggesting
   their capability to serve as competent reservoirs for Bartonella
   species. The findings in this study indicate that X. ramesis fleas can
   acquire several Bartonella strains from wild rodents but cannot transmit
   Bartonella transovarially.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, two lines of research have advanced our
   understanding of micro-evolution. On the one hand, a number of studies
   have generated evidence for strong selection on phenotypes (<link
   rid={''}b8{''}>Kingsolver et al. 2001) and the contemporary (sometimes
   deemed `rapid') evolution of phenotypic traits (<link
   rid={''}b6{''}>Hendry \& Kinnison 1999). On the other hand, other
   studies have sought to identify the genes that underlie ecologically
   important traits (<link rid={''}b11{''}>Ungerer et al. 2008). Over the
   next decade, micro-evolutionists might expect considerable progress from
   the study of contemporary evolution at both the phenotypic and genetic
   level simultaneously. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, <link
   rid={''}b9{''}>Le Rouzic et al. (2011) present a teaser for this
   approach. They examined contemporary evolution of an adaptive trait with
   a well-studied genetic basis, the number of lateral plates, in
   threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). A time series of 20
   years of change for this trait after introduction into a pond in Norway
   was compared with a similar time series of 12 years following the
   invasion of a lake in Alaska. Using a modelling approach, the authors
   then teased apart selection acting upon the phenotype and selection
   acting on a major effect gene. In both time series, selection was strong
   and consistent. The models suggested that selection could act directly
   on the phenotype, or through the gene's pleiotropic effects.}},

Abstract = {{The chase to uncover the genetic underpinnings of quantitative traits of
   ecological and evolutionary importance has been on for a good while.
   However, the potential power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
   as an approach to identify genes of interest in wild animal populations
   has remained untapped. Setting technical and economic explanations
   aside, the sobering lack of success in human GWAS might have fed this
   restraint. Namely, while GWAS have successfully identified genetic
   variants associated with hundreds of complex traits (e.g. <link
   rid={''}b4{''}>Ku et al. 2010), these variants have generally captured
   only a low percentage of variance in traits known to be highly
   heritable-an observation came to be known as the `missing heritability'
   (<link rid={''}b5{''}>Maher 2008; <link rid={''}b1{''}>Aulchenko et al.
   2009). Hence, if the vastly resourced human studies have been
   unsuccessful (but see: <link rid={''}b6{''}>Yang et al. 2010), why
   should we expect that less resourced studies of wild animal populations
   would be able do better? In this issue of Molecular Ecology, <link
   rid={''}b3{''}>Johnston et al. (2011) prove this line of thinking wrong.
   In an impressive and what may well be the most advanced gene mapping
   study ever performed in a wild population, they identify a single locus
   (RXFP2) responsible for explaining horn phenotype in feral domestic
   sheep from St Kilda (<link rid={''}f1{''}>Fig. 1). This same locus is
   also shown to account for up to 76\% of additive genetic variance in
   horn size in male sheep: this contrasts sharply with most human GWAS
   where mapped loci explain only a modest proportion of genetic variation
   in a given trait.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent Opinion article in Molecular Ecology, Wang (2010) emphasizes
   the fact that current patterns of genetic differentiation among
   populations reflect processes that have acted over temporal scales
   ranging from contemporary to ancient. He draws a sharp distinction
   between the fields of phylogeography (as the study of historical
   processes) and landscape genetics (which he restricts to very recent
   processes). Wang characterizes DNA sequence data as being inappropriate
   for the study of contemporary population processes and further states
   that studies which only include mitochondrial DNA or chloroplast DNA
   data cannot be considered part of landscape genetics. In this response,
   we clarify the generally accepted view that DNA sequence data can be
   analysed with methods that separate contemporary and historical
   processes. To illustrate this point, we summarize the study of
   Vandergast et al. (2007), which Wang mischaracterizes as being confused
   in terms of temporal scale. Although additional focus should be placed
   on the important issue of correct data interpretation, we disagree
   strongly with the implication that contemporary and historic processes
   cannot be separated in the analyses of DNA sequence data.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics and phylogeography both examine population-level
   microevolutionary processes, such as population structure and gene flow,
   in the context of environmental and geographic variation. They differ in
   terms of the spatial and temporal scales they typically investigate,
   meaning that different genetic markers and analytical methods are better
   suited for testing the different hypotheses typically posed by each
   discipline. In a recent comment, Bohonak \& Vandergast (2011) argue that
   I overlooked the value of mtDNA for landscape genetics in an article I
   published last year in Molecular Ecology (Wang 2010) and that a gap
   between landscape genetics and phylogeography, which I outlined, does
   not exist. Here, I clarify several points in my original article and

Abstract = {{Measuring the strength of natural selection is tremendously important in
   evolutionary biology, but remains a challenging task. In this work, we
   analyse the characteristics of selection for a morphological change
   (lateral-plate reduction) in the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus
   aculeatus. Adaptation to freshwater, leading with the reduction or loss
   of the bony lateral armour, has occurred in parallel on numerous
   occasions in this species. Completely-plated and low-plated sticklebacks
   were introduced into a pond, and the phenotypic changes were tracked for
   20 years. Fish from the last generation were genotyped for the
   Ectodysplasin-A (Eda) locus, the major gene involved in armour
   development. We found a strong fitness advantage for the freshwater-type
   fish (on average, 20\% fitness advantage for the freshwater morph, and
   92\% for the freshwater genotype). The trend is best explained by
   assuming that this fitness advantage is maximum at the beginning of the
   invasion and decreases with time. Such fitness differences provide a
   quantifiable example of rapid selection-driven phenotypic evolution
   associated with environmental change in a natural population.}},

Title = {{Measuring population differentiation using G(ST) or D? A simulation
   study with microsatellite DNA markers under a finite island model and

Abstract = {{The genetic differentiation of populations is a key parameter in
   population genetic investigations. Wright's F-ST (and its relatives such
   as G(ST)) has been a standard measure of differentiation. However, the
   deficiencies of these indexes have been increasingly realized in recent
   years, leading to some new measures being proposed, such as Jost's D
   (Molecular Ecology, 2008; 17, 4015). The existence of these new metrics
   has stimulated considerable debate and induced some confusion on which
   statistics should be used for estimating population differentiation.
   Here, we report a simulation study with neutral microsatellite DNA loci
   under a finite island model to compare the performance of G(ST) and D,
   particularly under nonequilibrium conditions. Our results suggest that
   there exist fundamental differences between the two statistics, and
   neither G(ST) nor D operates satisfactorily in all situations for
   quantifying differentiation. D is very sensitive to mutation models but
   G(ST) noticeably less so, which limits D's utility in population
   parameter estimation and comparisons across genetic markers. Also, the
   initial heterozygosity of the starting populations has some important
   effects on both the individual behaviours of G(ST) and D and their
   relative behaviours in early differentiation, and this effect is much
   greater for D than G(ST). In the early stages of differentiation, when
   initial heterozygosity is relatively low (< 0.5, if the number of
   subpopulations is large), G(ST) increases faster than D; the opposite is
   true when initial heterozygosity is high. Therefore, the state of the
   ancestral population appears to have some lasting impacts on population
   differentiation. In general, G(ST) can measure differentiation fairly
   well when heterozygosity is low whatever the causes; however, when
   heterozygosity is high (e.g. as a result of either high mutation rate or
   high initial heterozygosity) and gene flow is moderate to strong, G(ST)
   fails to measure differentiation. Interestingly, when population size is
   not very small (e.g. N >= 1000), G(ST) measures differentiation quite
   linearly with time over a long duration when gene flow is absent or very
   weak even if mutation rate is not low (e.g. mu = 0.001). In contrast, D,
   as a differentiation measure, performs rather robustly in all these
   situations. In practice, both indexes should be calculated and the
   relative levels of heterozygosities (especially H-S) and gene flow taken
   into account. We suggest that a comparison of the two indexes can
   generate useful insights into the evolutionary processes that influence
   population differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Nonrandom recruitment of parasites among hosts can lead to genetic
   differentiation among hosts and mating dynamics that promote inbreeding.
   It has been hypothesized that strictly aquatic parasites with
   intermediate hosts will behave as panmictic populations among hosts
   because ample opportunity exists for random mixing of unrelated
   individuals during transmission to the definitive host. A previous
   allozyme study on the marine trematode Lecithochirium fusiforme did not
   support this hypothesis; in that, there was genetic differentiation
   among, and significant heterozygote deficiencies within, definitive
   hosts. We revisit this system and use microsatellites to obtain
   multilocus genotypes. Our goal was to determine whether cryptic
   subgroups and/or the presence of clones could account for the apparent
   deviation from `panmixia'. We find strong evidence for cryptic
   subdivision (three genetic clusters) that causes the Wahlund effect and
   differentiation among definitive hosts. After accounting for these
   cryptic groups, we see panmictic genetic structure among definitive
   hosts that is consistent with the `high mixing in aquatic habitats'
   hypothesis. We see evidence for cotransmission of clones in all three
   clusters, but this level of clonal structure did not have a major impact
   in causing deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and only affected
   genetic differentiation among hosts in one cluster. A cursory
   examination of the data may have led to incorrect conclusions about
   nonrandom transmission. However, it is obvious in this system that there
   is more than meets the eye in relation to the actual make-up of parasite
   populations. In general, the methods we employ will be useful for
   elucidating hidden patterns in other organisms where cryptic structure
   may be common (e.g. those with limited morphology or complex life
   histories).}},

Abstract = {{Numerous marine invertebrates form endosymbiotic relationships with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, yet few studies have examined
   the population structure of these symbionts. Here, we elucidate the
   population genetic structure of Symbiodinium harboured by the Caribbean
   octocoral Gorgonia ventalina throughout the entire range of the host. We
   used ten microsatellite loci to survey 35 localities spanning 3124 km
   across the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. Diversity of Symbiodinium
   haplotypes was low within colonies of G. ventalina but high among
   colonies. Despite high haplotypic diversity, significant evidence of
   clonal reproduction in Symbiodinium was detected, and most clones
   occurred within localities, not among them. Pairwise measures of F(ST)
   illustrated significant differentiation in 98\% of comparisons between
   localities, suggesting low levels of gene flow. Clustering analyses
   identified six genetic groups whose distribution delimited four broad
   biogeographic regions. There was evidence of some connectivity among
   regions, corresponding with known geographic and oceanographic features.
   Fine-scale spatial surveys of G. ventalina colonies failed to detect
   differentiation among Symbiodinium at the metre scale. However,
   significant differentiation was observed among Symbiodinium hosted by
   sympatric G. ventalina colonies of different size/age classes. This
   cohort effect suggests that Symbiodinium may have an epidemic population
   structure, whereby G. ventalina recruits are infected by the locally
   predominant symbiont strain(s), which change over time.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean currents are expected to be the predominant environmental factor
   influencing the dispersal of planktonic larvae or spores; yet, their
   characterization as predictors of marine connectivity has been hindered
   by a lack of understanding of how best to use oceanographic data. We
   used a high-resolution oceanographic model output and Lagrangian
   particle simulations to derive oceanographic distances (hereafter called
   transport times) between sites studied for Macrocystis pyrifera genetic
   differentiation. We build upon the classical isolation-by-distance
   regression model by asking how much additional variability in genetic
   differentiation is explained when adding transport time as predictor. We
   explored the extent to which gene flow is dependent upon seasonal
   changes in ocean circulation. Because oceanographic transport between
   two sites is inherently asymmetric, we also compare the explanatory
   power of models using the minimum or the mean transport times. Finally,
   we compare the direction of connectivity as estimated by the
   oceanographic model and genetic assignment tests. We show that the
   minimum transport time had higher explanatory power than the mean
   transport time, revealing the importance of considering asymmetry in
   ocean currents when modelling gene flow. Genetic assignment tests were
   much less effective in determining asymmetry in gene flow.
   Summer-derived transport times, in particular for the month of June,
   which had the strongest current speed, greatest asymmetry and highest
   spore production, resulted in the best-fit model explaining twice the
   variability in genetic differentiation relative to models that use
   geographic distance or habitat continuity. The best overall model also
   included habitat continuity and explained 65\% of the variation in
   genetic differentiation among sites.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation in
   natural populations is a fundamental goal of evolutionary genetics. Wild
   Soay sheep (Ovis aries) have an inherited polymorphism for horn
   morphology in both sexes, controlled by a single autosomal locus, Horns.
   The majority of males have large normal horns, but a small number have
   vestigial, deformed horns, known as scurs; females have either normal
   horns, scurs or no horns (polled). Given that scurred males and polled
   females have reduced fitness within each sex, it is counterintuitive
   that the polymorphism persists within the population. Therefore,
   identifying the genetic basis of horn type will provide a vital
   foundation for understanding why the different morphs are maintained in
   the face of natural selection. We conducted a genome-wide association
   study using similar to 36 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
   determined the main candidate for Horns as RXFP2, an autosomal gene with
   a known involvement in determining primary sex characters in humans and
   mice. Evidence from additional SNPs in and around RXFP2 supports a new
   model of horn-type inheritance in Soay sheep, and for the first time,
   sheep with the same horn phenotype but different underlying genotypes
   can be identified. In addition, RXFP2 was shown to be an additive
   quantitative trait locus (QTL) for horn size in normal-horned males,
   accounting for up to 76\% of additive genetic variation in this trait.
   This finding contrasts markedly from genome-wide association studies of
   quantitative traits in humans and some model species, where it is often
   observed that mapped loci only explain a modest proportion of the
   overall genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is polymorphic for
   chromosomal inversion 2La, whose frequency strongly correlates with
   degree of aridity across environmental gradients. Recent physiological
   studies have associated 2La with resistance to desiccation in adults and
   thermal stress in larvae, consistent with its proposed role in aridity
   tolerance. However, the genetic basis of these traits remains unknown.
   To identify genes that could be involved in the differential response to
   thermal stress, we compared global gene expression profiles of
   heat-hardened 2La or 2L+a larvae at three time points, for up to eight
   hours following exposure to the heat stress. Treatment and control time
   series, replicated four times, revealed a common and massive induction
   of a core set of heat-shock genes regardless of 2La orientation.
   However, clear differences between the 2La and 2L+a arrangements emerged
   at the earliest (0.25 h) time point, in the intensity and nature of the
   stress response. Overall, 2La was associated with the more aggressive
   response: larger numbers of genes were heat responsive and up-regulated.
   Transcriptionally induced genes were enriched for functions related to
   ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, chaperoning and energy metabolism.
   The more muted transcriptional response of 2L+a was largely repressive,
   including genes involved in proteolysis and energy metabolism. These
   results may help explain the maintenance of the 2La inversion
   polymorphism in An. gambiae, as the survival benefits offered by high
   thermal sensitivity in harsh climates could be offset by the metabolic
   costs of such a drastic response in more equable climates.}},

Abstract = {{Grosmannia clavigera is a fungal pathogen of pine forests in western
   North America and a symbiotic associate of two sister bark beetles:
   Dendroctonus ponderosae and D. jeffreyi. This fungus and its beetle
   associate D. ponderosae are expanding in large epidemics in western
   North America. Using the fungal genome sequence and gene annotations, we
   assessed whether fungal isolates from the two beetles inhabiting
   different species of pine in epidemic regions of western Canada and the
   USA, as well as in localized populations outside of the current
   epidemic, represent different genetic lineages. We characterized
   nucleotide variations in 67 genomic regions and selected 15 for the
   phylogenetic analysis. Using concordance of gene genealogies and
   distinct ecological characteristics, we identified two sibling
   phylogenetic species: Gc and Gs. Where the closely related Pinus
   ponderosa and P. jeffreyi are infested by localized populations of their
   respective beetles, Gc is present. In contrast, Gs is an exclusive
   associate of D. ponderosae mainly present on its primary host-tree P.
   contorta; however, in the current epidemic areas, it is also found in
   other pine species. These results suggest that the host-tree species and
   the beetle population dynamics may be important factors associated with
   the genetic divergence and diversity of fungal partners in the
   beetle-tree ecosystems. Gc represents the original G. clavigera
   holotype, and Gs should be described as a new species.}},

Title = {{Characterization of a genomic divergence island between black-and-yellow
   and gopher Sebastes rockfishes}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2603-2618}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Islands of high genomic divergence that contain genes of evolutionary
   significance may form between diverging species. The gopher rockfish,
   Sebastes carnatus, and black-and-yellow rockfish, S. chrysomelas, are
   sympatrically distributed temperate marine species inhabiting rocky
   reefs and kelp forests on the west coast of the United States. Prior
   studies documented low levels of genetic divergence between the two
   species, except at a single microsatellite locus that displayed high
   divergence, Sra.7-2. To better characterize genome wide divergence, we
   scored 25 additional microsatellite loci. Mean neutral divergence
   between species (F-ST = 0.01) changed little from prior estimates.
   Sra.7-2 continued to be an extreme divergence outlier. Five novel
   microsatellites within +/- 15 kb of Sra.7-2 were characterized. High
   divergence, consistently low diversity in S. chrysomelas, and linkage
   disequilibrium were detected at these loci, suggesting the influence of
   recent selection. However, coalescent modelling of divergence at neutral
   and Sra.7-2 regions showed that initial divergence at Sra.7-2 was
   ancient, likely predating divergence at neutral regions. It is therefore
   unlikely that Sra.7-2 divergence represents solely recent ecological
   divergence within one species and may represent the action of recurrent
   selection. Introgressive gene flow (2N(E)m) was much higher (>> 1) at
   neutral than Sra.7-2 regions (<< 1) despite evidence that two S.
   carnatus individuals have recently mixed ancestry at the Sra.7-2 region.
   The Sra.7-2 genomic region is likely one of several regions containing
   genes involved in initiating and maintaining species integrity.
   Completion of the final stages of speciation appears to be a slow and
   ongoing process for these species.}},

Abstract = {{The mutualistic symbiosis between fungus-growing termites and
   Termitomyces fungi originated in Africa and shows a moderate degree of
   interaction specificity. Here we estimate the age of the mutualism and
   test the hypothesis that the major splits have occurred simultaneously
   in the host and in the symbiont. We present a scenario where
   fungus-growing termites originated in the African rainforest just before
   the expansion of the savanna, about 31 Ma (19-49 Ma). Whereas rough age
   correspondence is observed for the four main clades of host and
   symbiont, the analysis reveals several recent events of host switching
   followed by dispersal of the symbiont throughout large areas and
   throughout different host genera. The most spectacular of these is a
   group of closely related fungi (the maximum age of which is estimated to
   be 2.4 Ma), shared between the divergent genera Microtermes,
   Ancistrotermes, Acanthotermes and Synacanthotermes (which diverged at
   least 16.7 Ma), and found throughout the African continent and on
   Madagascar. The lack of geographical differentiation of fungal symbionts
   shows that continuous exchange has occurred between regions and across
   host species.}},

   history of A. rufa across its distribution, employing both mitochondrial
   DNA control region sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci. Our
   results propose that this species was greatly affected by Pleistocene
   glaciations. The mismatch analyses suggest that the current populations
   resulted from post-glacial expansion and subsequent differentiation
   resulting in five diagnosable genetic clusters: Southwestern,
   Central-eastern, Northwestern, Balearic and French and Italian. Further,
   we found evidence of three glacial refugia within the currently
   recognized Iberian glacial refugium. The intraspecific structure
   revealed by both maternal and biparental phylogeographic analyses was
   not resolved in the phylogenetic analyses. Based on all considerations,
   we recommended that five management units be recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm are exposed to substantially different environments during their
   life history, such as seminal fluid or the female sexual tract, but
   remarkably little information is currently available about whether and
   how much sperm composition and function alters in these different
   environments. Here, we used the honeybee Apis mellifera and quantified
   differences in the abundance and activity of sperm proteins sampled
   either from ejaculates or from the female's sperm storage organ. We find
   that stored and ejaculated sperm contain the same set of proteins but
   that the abundance of specific proteins differed substantially between
   ejaculated and stored sperm. Most proteins with a significant change in
   abundance are related to sperm energy metabolism. Enzymatic assays
   performed for a subset of these proteins indicate that specific protein
   activities differ between stored and ejaculated sperm and are typically
   higher in ejaculated compared to stored sperm. We provide evidence that
   the cellular machinery of sperm is plastic and differs between sperm
   within the ejaculate and within the female's storage organ. Future work
   will be required to test whether these changes are a consequence of
   active adaptation or sperm senescence and whether they alter sperm
   performance in different chemical environments or impact on the cost of
   sperm storage by the female. However, these changes can be expected to
   influence sperm performance and therefore determine sperm viability or
   sperm competitiveness for storage or egg fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding speciation is a fundamental aim of evolutionary biology
   and a very challenging one. Speciation can be viewed as the dynamics of
   genetic differentiation between populations resulting in substantial
   reproductive isolation (<link rid={''}b9{''}>Gavrilets 2003). It was
   generally accepted that very small levels of migration prevent genetic
   differentiation among populations and, therefore, speciation. However,
   recent theoretical work showed that sympatric speciation is possible
   (<link rid={''}b9{''}>Gavrilets 2003). Nevertheless, providing empirical
   evidence that gene flow occurred during speciation is challenging
   because several gene flow scenarios can explain observed patterns of
   genetic differentiation. Positive migration rate estimates alone do not
   prove ongoing gene flow during divergence. We also need to know whether
   migration took place before, during or after speciation. There is no
   statistical method specifically aimed at estimating gene flow timing,
   but several studies used the isolation with migration model (<link
   rid={''}b13 b14{''}>Hey \& Nielsen 2004, 2007; <link rid={''}b12{''}>Hey
   2010b) to estimate this parameter and make inferences about speciation
   scenarios. It is tempting to use statistical methods to estimate
   important evolutionary parameters even if they do not appear explicitly
   in the inference model. Nevertheless, before doing so, we need to
   determine whether they can provide reliable results. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, <link rid={''}b20000{''}>Strasburg and Rieseberg
   (2011) present a simulation study that examines the degree to which gene
   flow timing estimates obtained from IMa2 (<link rid={''}b11 b12{''}>Hey
   2010b) can be used to make inferences about speciation mode. Their
   results are sobering; gene flow timing estimates obtained in this way
   are not reliable and cannot be used to unequivocally establish if gene
   flow was ongoing during speciation.}},

Abstract = {{In chemistry, the law of mass action describes how variations in the
   concentrations of chemical compounds lead to different chemical reaction
   outcomes. Does the extent of hybridization, or more particularly, the
   formation of hybrid offspring, likewise depend on the local abundance of
   pollen from compatible species in systems as complex as tall trees which
   depend on (insect) pollinators? In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   <link rid={''}b2{''}>Field et al. (2011a) present a study involving two
   ecologically divergent eucalypt species (<link rid={''}f1{''}>Fig. 1).
   By comparing several contrasting settings with different local densities
   and geographical arrangements of adult trees and by studying parentage
   in progeny arrays, they show that on top of pre-mating barriers like
   flowering time differences, local demography and varying scales of
   pollen dispersal, which in themselves depend on pollinator behaviour in
   reaction to flowering abundance, all interact in a somewhat predictable
   way. In other words, these factors can explain some of the variation in
   hybrid formation observed. In this way, the study introduces important
   progress towards a quantitative description of hybridization potential.
   Therefore, let me tell you about the birds and the bees and the flowers
   and the trees (<link rid={''}b9{''}>Newman 1964).}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of behaviour examine traits whose proximate causes include
   sensory input and neural decision-making, but conflict and collaboration
   in biological systems began long before brains or sensory systems
   evolved. Many behaviours result from non-neural mechanisms such as
   direct physical contact between recognition proteins or modifications of
   development that coincide with altered behaviour. These simple molecular
   mechanisms form the basis of important biological functions and can
   enact organismal interactions that are as subtle, strategic and
   interesting as any. The genetic changes that underlie divergent
   molecular behaviours are often targets of selection, indicating that
   their functional variation has important fitness consequences. These
   behaviours evolve by discrete units of quantifiable phenotypic effect
   (amino acid and regulatory mutations, often by successive mutations of
   the same gene), so the role of selection in shaping evolutionary change
   can be evaluated on the scale at which heritable phenotypic variation
   originates. We describe experimental strategies for finding genes that
   underlie biochemical and developmental alterations of behaviour, survey
   the existing literature highlighting cases where the simplicity of
   molecular behaviours has allowed insight to the evolutionary process and
   discuss the utility of a genetic knowledge of the sources and spectrum
   of phenotypic variation for a deeper understanding of how genetic and
   phenotypic architectures evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic and genetic replenishment of populations through the
   exchange of individuals is essential for their persistence. Habitat loss
   and fragmentation can reduce the permeability of landscapes, hinder
   dispersal and compromise the genetic integrity of populations over time.
   We examined ecological connectivity in an arboreal marsupial, the common
   ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) in fragmented forests of
   southeastern Australia. This species is potentially robust to
   fragmentation based on its presence in degraded landscapes and known use
   of plantations for foraging and nesting. Using 312 individuals screened
   at 15 microsatellites, we measured dispersal and gene flow across seven
   native Eucalyptus forest remnants surrounded by exotic Pinus radiata
   plantations and three sites within a large continuous forest. The
   permeability of the pine matrix to dispersing possums was significantly
   lower than that of the native forest. Small, isolated patches exhibited
   signatures of genetic drift, having lower heterozygosity and allelic
   richness than possums in large patches. Most (87\%) possums were born in
   their sampled patch or dispersed only short distances into neighbouring
   remnants. The continuous forest was identified as an important source of
   immigrants only for proximate patches (within 2.5 km), thus emphasizing
   for the common ringtail possum and more specialized arboreal mammals the
   need to conserve large, proximate forest remnants. Our findings
   highlight the importance of using genetic tools to understand the
   long-term biological consequences of fragmentation for effective
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The conditions of phenotypic and genetic population differentiation
   allow inferences about the evolution, preservation and loss of
   biological diversity. In Lake Tanganyika, water level fluctuations are
   assumed to have had a major impact on the evolution of stenotopic
   littoral species, though this hypothesis has not been specifically
   examined so far. The present study investigates whether subtly
   differentiated colour patterns of adjacent Tropheus moorii populations
   are maintained in isolation or in the face of continuous gene flow, and
   whether the presumed influence of water level fluctuations on lacustrine
   cichlids can be demonstrated in the small-scale population structure of
   the strictly stenotopic, littoral Tropheus. Distinct population
   differentiation was found even across short geographic distances and
   minor habitat barriers. Population splitting chronology and demographic
   histories comply with our expectation of old and rather stable
   populations on steeper sloping shore, and more recently established
   populations in a shallower region. Moreover, population expansions seem
   to coincide with lake level rises in the wake of Late Pleistocene
   megadroughts similar to 100 KYA. The imprint of hydrologic events on
   current population structure in the absence of ongoing gene flow
   suggests that phenotypic differentiation among proximate Tropheus
   populations evolves and persists in genetic isolation. Sporadic gene
   flow is effected by lake level fluctuations following climate changes
   and controlled by the persistence of habitat barriers during lake level
   changes. Since similar demographic patterns were previously reported for
   Lake Malawi cichlids, our data furthermore strengthen the hypothesis
   that major climatic events synchronized facets of cichlid evolution
   across the East African Great Lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of geographic scales at which marine organisms display
   genetic variation mirrors the biophysical and ecological complexity of
   dispersal by pelagic larvae. Yet little is known about the effect of
   larval ecology on genetic population patterns, partly because detailed
   data of larval ecology do not yet exist for most taxa. One species for
   which this data is available is Eleutheronema tetradactylum, a tropical
   Indo-West Pacific shorefish. Here, we use a partial sequence
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) marker and five
   microsatellite loci to survey the genetic structure of E. tetradactylum
   across northern Australia. Structure was found throughout the range and
   isolation by distance was strong, explaining approximately 87 and 64\%
   of the genetic variation in microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively.
   Populations separated by as little as 15 km also showed significant
   genetic structure, implying that local populations are mainly insular
   and self-seeding on an ecological time frame. Because the larvae of E.
   tetradactylum have lower swimming performance and poor orientation
   compared with other tropical fishes, even modest larval abilities may
   permit self-recruitment rather than passive dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be a powerful genetic marker for tracing
   origins and history of invasive populations. Here, we use mtDNA to
   address questions relevant to the understanding of invasion pathways of
   common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) into Western Australia (WA) and
   discuss the utility of this marker to provide information useful to
   invasive species management. Mitochondrial sequence data indicate two
   geographically restricted genetic groups within Australia. Evidence of
   dispersal from genetically distinct sources outside the sampled range of
   starlings in Australia suggests increased vigilance by management
   agencies may be required to prevent further incursions from widely
   separated localities. Overall, genetic diversity in Australia was lower
   than in samples from the native range. Within Australia, genetic
   diversity was lowest in the most recently colonized area in the west,
   indicating that demographic bottlenecks have occurred in this area.
   Evidence of restricted dispersal between localities on the edge of the
   range expansion (ERE) in WA and other Australian sampling localities
   suggests that localized control within the ERE may be effective in
   preventing further range expansion. Signatures of spatial and
   demographic expansion are present in mismatch analyses from sampling
   localities located at the ERE, but neutrality indices did not support
   this finding, suggesting that the former may be more sensitive to recent
   expansion. Additionally, mismatch analyses support the presence of
   admixture, which is likely to have occurred pre-introduction. We compare
   our findings with those from a microsatellite study of the same samples
   and discuss how the mtDNA analyses used here offer valuable and unique
   insights into the invasion history of introduced species.}},

Abstract = {{In plants, ecologically important life history traits often display
   clinal patterns of population divergence. Such patterns can provide
   strong evidence for spatially varying selection across environmental
   gradients but also may result from nonselective processes, such as
   genetic drift, population bottlenecks and spatially restricted gene
   flow. Comparison of population differentiation in quantitative traits
   (measured as Q(ST)) with neutral molecular markers (measured as F(ST))
   provides a useful tool for understanding the relative importance of
   adaptive and nonadaptive processes in the formation and maintenance of
   clinal variation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of geographic
   variation in key life history traits in the diploid perennial sunflower
   species Helianthus maximiliani across a broad latitudinal transect in
   North America. Strong population differentiation was found for days to
   flowering, growth rate and multiple size-related traits. Differentiation
   in these traits greatly exceeds neutral predictions, as determined both
   by partial Mantel tests and by comparisons of global Q(ST) values with
   theoretical F(ST) distributions. These findings indicate that clinal
   variation in these life history traits likely results from local
   adaptation driven by spatially heterogeneous environments.}},

Abstract = {{Insular populations have attracted the attention of evolutionary
   biologists because of their morphological and ecological peculiarities
   with respect to their mainland counterparts. Founder effects and genetic
   drift are known to distribute neutral genetic variability in these
   demes. However, elucidating whether these evolutionary forces have also
   shaped adaptive variation is crucial to evaluate the real impact of
   reduced genetic variation in small populations. Genes of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) are classical examples of
   evolutionarily relevant loci because of their well-known role in
   pathogen confrontation and clearance. In this study, we aim to
   disentangle the partial roles of genetic drift and natural selection in
   the spatial distribution of MHC variation in insular populations. To
   this end, we integrate the study of neutral (22 microsatellites and one
   mtDNA locus) and MHC class II variation in one mainland (Iberia) and two
   insular populations (Fuerteventura and Menorca) of the endangered
   Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Overall, the distribution of
   the frequencies of individual MHC alleles (n = 17 alleles from two class
   II B loci) does not significantly depart from neutral expectations,
   which indicates a prominent role for genetic drift over selection.
   However, our results point towards an interesting co-evolution of gene
   duplicates that maintains different pairs of divergent alleles in strong
   linkage disequilibrium on islands. We hypothesize that the co-evolution
   of genes may counteract the loss of genetic diversity in insular demes,
   maximize antigen recognition capabilities when gene diversity is
   reduced, and promote the co-segregation of the most efficient allele
   combinations to cope with local pathogen communities.}},

Abstract = {{Disaccord between the supply and demand of energy (carbon, C) and
   certain material elements (e.g. phosphorus, P) across trophic levels is
   common in most ecosystems and impacts the strength of trophic
   interactions and ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient
   recycling. Yet, we know little about mechanisms operating at the lower
   levels of biological organization that drive such higher-level
   ecological processes. Such information should help refine theories
   integrating biological processes at multiple levels of organization.
   Understanding the expression and functions of genes that underlie (to a
   large degree) physiological adjustments made by organisms to
   stoichiometric imbalances at trophic interfaces is a first step in this
   enterprise. Here, we investigate adjustments in gene expression to
   varying supply and demand of phosphorus relative to other dietary
   components in the keystone limnetic herbivore, Daphnia pulex. Daphniids
   were fed an algal diet of either LoC-HiP (molar C:P similar to 100) or
   HiC-LoP (molar C:P similar to 900) for 5 days, resulting in significant
   growth reductions under HiC-LoP conditions. Microarrays measured the
   transcriptional regulation of 8217 annotated protein-coding genes under
   contrasting dietary conditions and revealed 1818 differentially
   expressed (DE) genes; 19\% are genes unique to the Daphnia lineage. We
   mapped DE genes onto a global chart of metabolic pathways to obtain a
   systems-level perspective on the responses to stoichiometric imbalances.
   Daphnia differentially regulated pathways were involved in sequestering
   limiting elements, and in dealing with the products of metabolic
   adjustments that may be triggered by nutrient stress in primary
   producers. Functional genomics at trophic interfaces illuminate the
   complexity of processes underlying stoichiometric constraints on energy
   and nutrient fluxes in ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The question of whether speciation can occur in the presence of gene
   flow has long been a contentious one. However, measuring the amount and
   timing of gene flow remains challenging. The computer program IMa2
   allows researchers to estimate the timing of migration events for each
   locus during analyses, and these estimates have been used to infer the
   timing of introgression and mode of speciation. We use simulated data
   sets to examine the degree to which gene-flow timing estimates can be
   used for these purposes, and what demographic conditions and data sets
   may be most amenable to gene-flow timing estimation. We find that the
   90\% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of gene-flow timing is
   almost always substantially wider than the actual window of gene flow,
   and increasing the information content of the data set in terms of
   number of loci, number of sequences sampled or locus length (and thus
   number of variable sites) has little impact on the posterior
   distribution over the range of values we tested. Even when simulated
   gene flow only occurred over the most recent 0.01\% of the species'
   history, the HPD interval usually encompasses the inferred divergence
   time. Our results indicate that gene-flow timing estimates made using
   the method currently implemented in IMa2 cannot reliably be used to make
   inferences about the timing of introgression between diverged species or
   to distinguish between speciation with gene flow and allopatric
   speciation followed by one or more episodes of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency of hybridization in plants is context dependent and can be
   influenced by the local mating environment. We used progeny arrays and
   admixture and pollen dispersal analyses to assess the relative
   importance of pre-mating reproductive barriers and the local demographic
   environment as explanations of variation in hybrid frequency in three
   mapped hybrid zones of Eucalyptus aggregata and E. rubida. A total of
   731 open-pollinated progeny from 36 E. aggregata maternal parents were
   genotyped using six microsatellite markers. Admixture analysis
   identified substantial variation in hybrid frequency among progeny
   arrays (0-76.9\%). In one hybrid zone, hybrid frequency was related to
   pre-mating barriers (degree of flowering synchrony) and demographic
   components of the local mating environment (decreasing population size,
   closer proximity to E. rubida and hybrid trees). At this site, average
   pollen dispersal distance was less and almost half (46\%) of the hybrid
   progeny were sired by local E. rubida and hybrid trees. In contrast, at
   the other two sites, pre-mating and demographic factors were not related
   to hybrid frequency. Compared to the first hybrid zone where most of the
   E. rubida (76\%) and all hybrids flowered, in the remaining sites fewer
   E. rubida (22-41\%) and hybrid trees (0-50\%) flowered and their
   reproductive success was lower (sired 0-23\% of hybrids). As a result,
   most hybrids were sired by external E. rubida/hybrids located at least
   2-3 km away. These results indicate that although pre-mating barriers
   and local demography can influence patterns of hybridization, their
   importance can depend upon the scale of pollen dispersal.}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2380-2389}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Several animal species have recently been shown to have hybrid origins,
   but no avian examples have been documented with molecular evidence. We
   investigate whether the Audubon's warbler (Dendroica auduboni), one of
   four visually distinct species in the yellow-rumped warbler complex, has
   originated through hybridization between two other species in this
   group, the myrtle warbler (D. coronata) and black-fronted warbler (D.
   nigrifrons). Analysis of nuclear amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (AFLP) and sequence markers shows that Audubon's warblers are
   genetically intermediate and carry a mixture of alleles otherwise found
   only in one or the other of their putative parental species. Audubon's
   warblers also carry two deeply divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages,
   each shared with only one putative parental form. Broad clines between
   Audubon's and black-fronted warblers in AFLP markers call into question
   the validity of these two forms as full species; nevertheless, our
   results suggest that the Audubon's warbler probably originated through
   hybridization between two long-diverged species. It is likely that more
   cases of avian species of hybrid origin will be revealed by surveys of
   variation in nuclear DNA and other traits.}},

Abstract = {{DNA sequence studies frequently reveal evidence of cryptic lineages in
   morphologically uniform species, many of which turn out to be
   evolutionarily distinct species. The Common Raven (Corvus corax)
   includes two deeply divergent mtDNA lineages: one lineage seems
   restricted to western North America and the other is Holarctic in
   distribution. These deep clades hint of the possibility of cryptic
   species in the western United States. We tested this hypothesis in a
   population consisting of an equal proportion of both mtDNA clades, by
   quantifying mating patterns and associated fitness consequences with
   respect to mtDNA. We also tested for morphological, behavioural and
   ecological correlates of sex and mtDNA clade membership. Mate pairings
   were random with respect to mtDNA clades, and there were no differences
   in reproductive success between assortatively and nonassortatively mated
   pairs. We found no differences in survival or resource use between
   clades. There were no differences in morphological or behavioural
   characters between mtDNA clades, except one clade trended towards
   greater mobility. These results suggest there are no barriers to gene
   flow between mtDNA clades and argue that the mtDNA clades have remerged
   in this population, likely due to a lack of ecological or signal
   differentiation between individuals in each lineage. Hence, in Common
   Ravens, phylogeographic structure in mtDNA is a reflection of likely
   past isolation rather than currently differentiated species.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural isolation may lead to complete speciation when partial
   postzygotic isolation acts in the presence of divergent-specific
   mate-recognition systems. These conditions exist where Mus musculus
   musculus and M. m. domesticus come into contact and hybridize. We
   studied two mate-recognition signal systems, based on urinary and
   salivary proteins, across a Central European portion of the mouse hybrid
   zone. Introgression of the genomic regions responsible for these
   signals: the major urinary proteins (MUPs) and androgen binding proteins
   (ABPs), respectively, was compared to introgression at loci assumed to
   be nearly neutral and those under selection against hybridization. The
   preference of individuals taken from across the zone regarding these
   signals was measured in Y mazes, and we develop a model for the analysis
   of the transition of such traits under reinforcement selection. The
   strongest assortative preferences were found in males for urine and
   females for ABP. Clinal analyses confirm nearly neutral introgression of
   an Abp locus and two loci closely linked to the Abp gene cluster,
   whereas two markers flanking the Mup gene region reveal unexpected
   introgression. Geographic change in the preference traits matches our
   reinforcement selection model significantly better than standard cline
   models. Our study confirms that behavioural barriers are important
   components of reproductive isolation between the house mouse subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Unexpectedly strong geographic structures in many cosmopolitan species
   of marine holoplankton challenge the traditional view of their
   unrestrained dispersal and presumably high gene flow. We investigated
   cryptic lineage diversity and comparative phylogeography of a common
   estuarine copepod, Acartia tonsa, on the US Atlantic coast, using
   mitochondrial (mtCOI) and nuclear (nITS) gene markers. Three broadly
   sympatric lineages (F, S, X) were defined by genealogically concordant
   clades across both gene trees, strongly supporting recognition as
   reproductively isolated species. Limited dispersal seems to have had a
   major role in population differentiation of A. tonsa in general, with
   gene flow propensities rank ordered X > S > F. Geographic structure was
   found only at large scales (1000-2000 km) in X and S. Phylogeographic
   patterns in all three lineages were mostly concordant with previously
   recognized zoogeographic provinces but a large mid-Atlantic gap in the
   occurrence of lineage X, coupled with its presence in Europe, suggests
   possible nonindigenous origins. For lineage F, physiological adaptation
   to low-salinity environments is likely to have accentuated barriers to
   gene flow and allopatric differentiation at both regional and
   continental scales. Three allopatric F sublineages inferred a southern
   centre of origin and a stepwise northward diversification history at the
   continental scale. The most recently derived F sublineages, in the
   mid-Atlantic Bight, showed strong phylogeographic patterns at nITS
   albeit weaker at mtCOI. Applying a crustacean mtCOI molecular clock
   suggests that A. tonsa lineages diverged pre-Pleistocene but
   mid-Atlantic F lineage diversification may be post-Pleistocene.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods have moulded the
   evolutionary history of European cold-adapted organisms. The role of the
   different mountain massifs has, however, not been accurately
   investigated in the case of high-altitude insect species. Here, we focus
   on three closely related species of non-flying leaf beetles of the genus
   Oreina (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), which are often found in sympatry
   within the mountain ranges of Europe. After showing that the species
   concept as currently applied does not match barcoding results, we show,
   based on more than 700 sequences from one nuclear and three
   mitochondrial genes, the role of biogeography in shaping the
   phylogenetic hypothesis. Dating the phylogeny using an insect molecular
   clock, we show that the earliest lineages diverged more than 1 Mya and
   that the main shift in diversification rate occurred between 0.36 and
   0.18 Mya. By using a probabilistic approach on the parsimony-based
   dispersal/vicariance framework (MP-DIVA) as well as a direct likelihood
   method of state change optimization, we show that the Alps acted as a
   cross-roads with multiple events of dispersal to and reinvasion from
   neighbouring mountains. However, the relative importance of vicariance
   vs. dispersal events on the process of rapid diversification remains
   difficult to evaluate because of a bias towards overestimation of
   vicariance in the DIVA algorithm. Parallels are drawn with recent
   studies of cold-adapted species, although our study reveals novel
   patterns in diversity and genetic links between European mountains, and
   highlights the importance of neglected regions, such as the Jura and the
   Balkanic range.}},

Abstract = {{The pervasive influence of resident microorganisms on the phenotype of
   their hosts is exemplified by the intracellular bacterium Buchnera
   aphidicola, which provides its aphid partner with essential amino acids
   (EAAs). We investigated variation in the dietary requirement for EAAs
   among four pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) clones. Buchnera-derived
   nitrogen contributed to the synthesis of all EAAs for which aphid clones
   required a dietary supply, and to none of the EAAs for which all four
   clones had no dietary requirement, suggesting that low total dietary
   nitrogen may select for reduced synthesis of certain EAAs in some aphid
   clones. The sequenced Buchnera genomes showed that the EAA nutritional
   phenotype (i.e. the profile of dietary EAAs required by the aphid)
   cannot be attributed to sequence variation of Buchnera genes coding EAA
   biosynthetic enzymes. Metabolic modelling by flux balance analysis
   demonstrated that EAA output from Buchnera can be determined precisely
   by the flux of host metabolic precursors to Buchnera. Specifically, the
   four EAA nutritional phenotypes could be reproduced by metabolic models
   with unique profiles of host inputs, dominated by variation in supply of
   aspartate, homocysteine and glutamate. This suggests that the
   nutritional phenotype of the symbiosis is determined principally by host
   metabolism and transporter genes that regulate nutrient supply to
   Buchnera. Intraspecific variation in the nutritional phenotype of
   symbioses is expected to mediate partitioning of plant resources among
   aphid genotypes, potentially promoting the genetic subdivision of aphid
   populations. In this way, microbial symbioses may play an important role
   in the evolutionary diversification of phytophagous insects.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity consists of multiple scales, including functional diversity
   in ecological traits, species diversity and genetic diversity within
   species, and is declining across the globe, largely in response to human
   activities. While species extinctions are the most obvious aspect of
   this, there has also been a more insidious loss of genetic diversity
   within species. While a vast literature concerns each of these scales of
   biodiversity, less is known about how different scales affect one
   another. In particular, genetic and species diversity may influence each
   other in numerous ways, both positively and negatively. However, we know
   little about the mechanism behind these patterns. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, <link rid={''}b7{''}>Nestmann et al. (2011)
   experimentally explore the effect of species and functional diversity
   and composition of grassland plant communities on the genetic structure
   of one of the component species. Increasing species richness led to
   greater changes in the genetic composition of the focal populations over
   4 years, primarily because of genetic drift in smaller population sizes.
   However, there were also genetic changes in response to particular plant
   functional groups, indicating selective differences driven by plant
   community composition. These results suggest that different levels of
   biodiversity can trade-off in communities, which may prove a challenge
   for conservation biologists seeking to preserve all aspects of
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Species interactions are fundamental to ecology. Classic studies of
   competition, predation, parasitism and mutualism between macroscopic
   organisms have provided a foundation for the discipline, but many of the
   most important and intimate ecological interactions are microscopic in
   scale. These microscopic interactions include those occurring between
   eukaryotic hosts and their microbial symbionts. Such symbioses,
   ubiquitous in nature, provide experimental challenges because the
   partners often cannot live outside the symbiosis. With respect to the
   symbionts, this precludes utilizing classical microbiological and
   genetic techniques that require in vitro cultivation. Genomics, however,
   has rapidly changed the study of symbioses. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, <link rid={''}b3{''}>MacDonald et al. (2011), coupling symbiont
   whole-genome sequencing, experimental studies and metabolic modelling,
   provide novel insights into one of the best-studied symbioses, that
   between aphids and their obligate, nutrient-provisioning, intracellular
   bacteria, Buchnera aphidicola (<link rid={''}f1{''}>Fig. 1). MacDonald
   and colleagues assessed variation in the ability of aphid-Buchnera pairs
   to thrive on artificial diets missing different amino acids. As shown
   previously (e.g. <link rid={''}b9{''}>Wilkinson \& Douglas 2003),
   aphid-Buchnera pairs can differ in their requirements for external
   sources of essential amino acids. Such phenotypic variation could result
   from differences in Buchnera's amino acid biosynthetic capabilities or
   in the ability of aphids to interact with their symbionts. Whole-genome
   sequencing of the Buchnera genomes from four aphid lines with alternate
   nutritional phenotypes revealed that the environmental nutrients
   required by the aphid-Buchnera pairs could not be explained by sequence
   variation in the symbionts. Instead, a novel metabolic modelling
   approach suggested that much of the variation in nutritional phenotype
   could be explained by host variation in the capacity to provide
   necessary nutrient precursors to their symbionts. MacDonald et al.'s
   work complements a recent study by <link rid={''}b8{''}>Vogel \& Moran
   (2011), who through crossing experiments investigating the inheritance
   of a nutritional phenotype associated with a frameshift mutation in a
   Buchnera amino acid biosynthesis gene powerfully demonstrated that
   different host genotypes paired with the same symbiont genome could
   exhibit substantially different nutritional requirements.1 Thus, while
   there is little doubt that Buchnera are evolutionarily central to the
   nutritional ecology of aphids, the current work by <link
   rid={''}b3{''}>MacDonald et al. (2011) together with that of <link
   rid={''}b8{''}>Vogel \& Moran (2011) surprisingly demonstrates host
   dominance in defining and controlling the ecological niche of this
   particular symbiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Food webs involving plants, herbivorous insects and their predators
   account for 75\% of terrestrial biodiversity (<link

   plants, myriad ecological and social interactions depend on the
   perception and production of plant-borne mechanical vibrations (<link
   rid={''}b11{''}>Hill 2008). Study of ecological relationships has shown,
   for example, that termites monitor the vibrations produced by competing
   colonies in the same tree trunk (<link rid={''}b10{''}>Evans et al.

   produced by insects feeding or walking on plants (Pfannenstiel et al.

   substrate vibration, allowing them to communicate with potential mates
   or members of their social group (<link rid={''}b8{''}>Cokl \&
   Virant-Doberlet 2003; <link rid={''}b11{''}>Hill 2008). Surprisingly,
   research on the role of substrate vibrations in social and ecological
   interactions has for the most part proceeded independently, in spite of
   evidence from other communication modalities - acoustic, visual,
   chemical and electrical - that predators attend to the signals of their
   prey (Zuk \& Kolluru 1998; <link rid={''}b20{''}>Stoddard 1999). The
   study by <link rid={''}b22{''}>Virant-Doberlet et al. (2011) in this
   issue of Molecular Ecology now helps bring these two areas of vibration
   research together, showing that the foraging behaviour of a spider is
   influenced by the vibrational mating signals of its leafhopper prey.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic scans of multiple populations often reveal marker loci with
   greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this
   differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors,
   forming a genetic-environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for
   local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly
   differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent
   selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we
   highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e.
   environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities
   rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased
   differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous
   barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can
   shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become
   trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to
   ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers
   can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci
   involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains
   where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their
   existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities.
   More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and
   exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is
   weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can
   emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where
   habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain
   linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities,
   local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association
   between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e.
   the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous
   loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results
   from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are
   supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with
   environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted
   or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic
   barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the
   majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches - even
   when these are correlated to environmental variables.}},

Abstract = {{Telomere length is restored primarily through the action of the reverse
   transcriptase telomerase, which may contribute to a prolonged lifespan
   in some but not all species and may result in longer telomeres in one
   sex than the other. To what extent this is an effect of proximate
   mechanisms (e.g. higher stress in males, higher oestradiol/oestrogen
   levels in females), or is an evolved adaptation (stronger selection for
   telomere length in one sex), usually remains unknown. Sand lizard
   (Lacerta agilis) females have longer telomeres than males and better
   maintain telomere length through life than males do. We also show that
   telomere length more strongly contributes to life span and lifetime
   reproductive success in females than males and that telomere length is
   under sexually diversifying selection in the wild. Finally, we performed
   a selection analysis with number of recruited offspring into the adult
   population as a response variable with telomere length, life span and
   body size as predictor variables. This showed significant differences in
   selection pressures between the sexes with strong ongoing selection in
   females, with these three predictors explaining 63\% of the variation in
   recruitment. Thus, the sexually dimorphic telomere dynamics with longer
   telomeres in females is a result of past and ongoing selection in sand
   lizards. Finally, we compared the results from our selection analyses
   based on Telometric-derived data to the results based on data generated
   by the software ImageJ. ImageJ resulted in shorter average telomere
   length, but this difference had virtually no qualitative effect on the
   patterns of ongoing selection.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread pigmentation diversity coupled with a well-defined genetic
   system of melanin synthesis and patterning in Drosophila provides an
   excellent opportunity to study phenotypes undergoing evolutionary
   change. Pigmentation variation is highly correlated with different
   ecological variables and is thought to reflect adaptations to different
   environments. Several studies have linked candidate genes from
   Drosophila melanogaster to intra-population variation and interspecific
   morphological divergence, but less clearly to variation among
   populations forming pigmentation clines. We characterized a new thoracic
   trident pigmentation cline in D. melanogaster populations from eastern
   Australia, and applied a candidate gene approach to explain the majority
   of the geographically structured phenotypic variation. More melanized
   populations from higher latitudes tended to express less ebony than
   their tropical counterparts, and an independent artificial selection
   experiment confirmed this association. By partitioning temperature
   dependent effects, we showed that the genetic differences underlying
   clinal patterns for trident variation at 25 degrees C do not explain the
   patterns observed at 16 degrees C. Changes in thoracic trident
   pigmentation could be a common evolutionary response to climatically
   mediated environmental pressures. On the Australian east coast most of
   the changes appear to be associated with regulatory divergence of the
   ebony gene but this depends on temperature.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic
   architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between
   hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of
   introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of
   locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture.
   `Outlier' loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most
   of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated
   with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic
   data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as
   well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or
   underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian
   genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance
   or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline
   parameters, and `outlier' loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions
   affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic
   data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and
   M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression
   across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two
   X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of
   introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a
   combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and
   geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive
   isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare
   patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the
   Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the
   genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation remains a central enigma in biology, and nowhere is this more
   apparent than in shallow tropical seas where biodiversity rivals that of
   tropical rainforests. Obvious barriers to gene flow are few and most
   marine species have a highly dispersive larval stage, which should
   greatly decrease opportunities for speciation via geographic isolation.
   The disparity in the level of geographic isolation for terrestrial and
   marine species is exemplified in Hawai'i where opportunities for
   allopatric speciation abound in the terrestrial realm. In contrast,
   marine colonizers of Hawai'i are believed to produce only a single
   endemic species or population, due to the lack of isolating barriers. To
   test the assertion that marine species do not diversify within Hawai'i,
   we examine the evolutionary origin of three endemic limpets (Cellana
   exarata, C. sandwicensis and C. talcosa) that are vertically segregated
   across a steep ecocline on rocky shores. Analyses of three mtDNA loci
   (12S, 16S, COI; 1565 bp) and two nDNA loci (ATPS beta, H3; 709 bp) in 26
   Indo-Pacific Cellana species (N = 414) indicates that Hawai'i was
   colonized once similar to 3.4-7.2 Ma from the vicinity of Japan. Trait
   mapping demonstrates that high-shore residence is the ancestral
   character state, such that mid- and low-shore species are the product of
   subsequent diversification. The Hawaiian Cellana are the first
   broadcast-spawners demonstrated to have speciated within any
   archipelago. The habitat stratification, extensive sympatry, and
   evolutionary history of these limpets collectively indicate a strong
   ecological component to speciation and support the growing body of
   evidence for non-allopatric speciation in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting spatial patterns of hybridization is important for
   evolutionary and conservation biology yet are hampered by poor
   understanding of how hybridizing species can interact. This is
   especially pertinent in contact zones where hybridizing populations are
   sympatric. In this study, we examined the extent of red wolf (Canis
   rufus) colonization and introgression where the species contacts a
   coyote (C. latrans) population in North Carolina, USA. We surveyed 22
   000 km2 in the winter of 2008 for scat and identified individual canids
   through genetic analysis. Of 614 collected scats, 250 were assigned to
   canids by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing. Canid samples were
   genotyped at 6-17 microsatellite loci (nDNA) and assigned to species
   using three admixture criteria implemented in two Bayesian clustering
   programs. We genotyped 82 individuals but none were identified as red
   wolves. Two individuals had red wolf mtDNA but no significant red wolf
   nDNA ancestry. One individual possessed significant red wolf nDNA
   ancestry (approximately 30\%) using all criteria, although seven other
   individuals showed evidence of red wolf ancestry (11-21\%) using the
   relaxed criterion. Overall, seven individuals were classified as hybrids
   using the conservative criteria and 37 using the relaxed criterion. We
   found evidence of dog (C. familiaris) and gray wolf (C. lupus)
   introgression into the coyote population. We compared the performance of
   different methods and criteria by analyzing known red wolves and
   hybrids. These results suggest that red wolf colonization and
   introgression in North Carolina is minimal and provide insights into the
   utility of Bayesian clustering methods to detect hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The current epidemic of the mountain pine beetle (MPB), an indigenous
   pest of western North American pine, has resulted in significant losses
   of lodgepole pine. The leading edge has reached Alberta where forest
   composition shifts from lodgepole to jack pine through a hybrid zone.
   The susceptibility of jack pine to MPB is a major concern, but there has
   been no evidence of host-range expansion, in part due to the difficulty
   in distinguishing the parentals and their hybrids. We tested the utility
   of a panel of microsatellite loci optimized for both species to classify
   lodgepole pine, jack pine and their hybrids using simulated data. We
   were able to accurately classify simulated individuals, and hence
   applied these markers to identify the ancestry of attacked trees. Here
   we show for the first time successful MPB attack in natural jack pine
   stands at the leading edge of the epidemic. This once unsuitable habitat
   is now a novel environment for MPB to exploit, a potential risk which
   could be exacerbated by further climate change. The consequences of
   host-range expansion for the vast boreal ecosystem could be significant.}},

Abstract = {{The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a worldwide pest
   and a vector of numerous plant viruses. B. tabaci is composed of dozens
   of morphologically indistinguishable biotypes and its taxonomic status
   is still controversial. This phloem-feeder harbours the primary symbiont
   Portiera aleyrodidarum and potentially six secondary symbionts:
   Cardinium, Arsenophonus, Hamiltonella, Rickettsia, Wolbachia and
   Fritschea. In the southwest Indian Ocean, La Reunion hosts two biotypes
   of this species: B (invasive) and Ms (indigenous). A multiplex PCR was
   developed to study the symbiont community of B. tabaci on La Reunion.
   Symbiont community prevalence and composition, host mitochondrial and
   nuclear genetic diversity, as well as host plant and localization, were
   described on field populations of La Reunion for B and Ms B. tabaci
   biotypes and their hybrids. A clear association between symbiotypes and
   biotypes was shown. Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Rickettsia were found in
   the Ms biotype (73.6\%, 64.2\% and 3.3\%, respectively). Hamiltonella
   (exclusively) and Rickettsia were found in the B biotype (78\% and
   91.2\%, respectively). Hybrids harboured all symbiotypes found in Ms and
   B populations, but with a higher prevalence of Ms symbiotypes than
   expected under random hybridization. An unexpected majority was
   Cardinium mono-infected (65.6\%), and a striking minority (9\%)
   harboured Cardinium/Arsenophonus. In the hybrids only, genetic diversity
   was linked to symbiotype. Among the hybrids, significant links were
   found between symbiotypes and: (i) mitochondrial COI sequences, i.e.
   maternal origin; and (ii) alleles of nuclear microsatellite loci,
   specific to either Ms or B parental biotype. Taken together, our results
   suggest that Cardinium and/or Arsenophonus may manipulate the
   reproduction of indigenous (Ms) with invasive (B) biotypes of Bemisia
   tabaci.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2188-2203}},

Abstract = {{Contrasting hypotheses exist about the relationship between plant
   species diversity and genetic diversity. However, experimental data of
   species diversity effects on genetic differentiation among populations
   are lacking. To address this, Lolium perenne was sown with an equal
   number of seeds in 78 experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) varying
   in species richness (1, 2, 4, 8 to 16) and functional group richness and
   composition (1-4; grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs). Population
   sizes were determined 4 years after sowing, and single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers based on bulk samples of up to 100
   individuals per population were applied. Genetic distances between the
   field populations and the initially sown seed population increased with
   sown species richness. The degree of genetic differentiation from the
   original seed population was largely explained by actual population
   sizes, which suggests that genetic drift was the main driver of
   differentiation. Weak relationships among relative allele frequencies
   and species diversity or actual population sizes, and a positive
   correlation between actual population sizes and expected heterozygosity
   also supported the role of genetic drift. Functional composition had
   additional effects on genetic differentiation of L. perenne populations,
   indicating a selection because of genotype-specific interactions with
   other species. Our study supports that genetic diversity is likely to be
   lower in plant communities with a higher number of interspecific
   competitors. Negative effects of species richness on population sizes
   may increase the probability of genetic drift, and selection because of
   genotype-specific interactions depending on species and genotypic
   community composition may modulate this relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrational signalling is a widespread form of animal communication and,
   in the form of sexual communication, has been generally regarded as
   inherently short-range and a private communication channel, free from
   eavesdropping by generalist predators. A combination of fieldwork and
   laboratory experiments was used to test the hypothesis that predators
   can intercept and exploit such signals. First, we developed and
   characterized PCR primers specific for leafhoppers of the genus Aphrodes
   and specifically for the species Aphrodes makarovi. Spiders were
   collected from sites where leafhoppers were present and screened with
   these primers to establish which spider species were significant
   predators of this species during the mating period of these leafhoppers.
   Analysis using PCR of the gut contents of tangle-web spiders,
   Enoplognatha ovata (Theridiidae), showed that they consume leafhoppers
   in the field at a greater rate when signalling adults were present than
   when nymphs were dominant, suggesting that the spiders were using these
   vibrations signals to find their prey. Playback and microcosm
   experiments then showed that E. ovata can use the vibrational signals of
   male leafhoppers as a cue during foraging and, as a result, killed
   significantly more male than female A. makarovi. Our results show, for
   the first time, that arthropod predators can exploit prey vibrational
   communication to obtain information about prey availability and use this
   information to locate and capture prey. This may be a widespread
   mechanism for prey location, one that is likely to be a major
   unrecognized driver of evolution in both predators and prey.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{A great proportion of bats of the New World family Phyllostomidae feed
   on fruit, nectar and pollen, and many of them present adaptations to
   feed also on insects and small vertebrates. So far, attempts to examine
   the diversification of feeding specialization in this group, and
   particularly the evolution of nectarivory and frugivory, have provided
   contradictory results. Here we propose a molecular phylogenetic
   hypothesis for phyllostomids. On the basis of a matrix of feeding habits
   that takes into account geographical and seasonal variation, we tested
   different hypotheses of the evolution of feeding specializations in the
   group. We find strong support for the evolutionary model of a direct
   dietary diversification from insectivory. The estimates of divergence
   times of phyllostomid bats and the reconstruction of ancestral states
   with a Bayesian approach support the parallel evolution of frugivory in
   five lineages and of nectarivory in three lineages during the Miocene.
   On the basis of these findings, and recent dietary studies, we propose
   that during the evolution of phyllostomids switches to new feeding
   mechanisms to access to abundant and/or underexploited resources
   provided selective advantages that favoured the appearance of ecological
   innovations independently in different lineages of the family. We did
   not find evidences to support or reject the hypothesis that the
   insectivorous most recent common ancestor of all phyllostomids was also
   phytophagous.}},

Abstract = {{Unravelling the mechanisms underlying variation in life history traits
   is of fundamental importance for our understanding of adaptation by
   natural selection. While progress has been made in mapping
   fitness-related phenotypes to genotypes, mainly in a handful of model
   organisms, functional genomic studies of life history adaptations are
   still in their infancy. In particular, despite a few notable exceptions,
   the genomic basis of life history variation in natural populations
   remains poorly understood. This is especially true for the genetic
   underpinnings of life history phenotypes subject to diversifying
   selection driven by ecological dynamics in patchy environments-as
   opposed to adaptations involving strong directional selection owing to
   major environmental changes, such as latitudinal gradients, extreme
   climatic events or transitions from salt to freshwater. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Wheat et al. (2011) now make a significant leap
   forward by applying the tools of functional genomics to
   dispersal-related life history variation in a butterfly metapopulation.
   Using a combination of microarrays, quantitative PCR and physiological
   measurements, the authors uncover several metabolic and endocrine
   factors that likely contribute to the observed life history phenotypes.
   By identifying molecular candidate mechanisms of fitness variation
   maintained by dispersal dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, they
   also begin to address fascinating interactions between the levels of
   physiology, ecology and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{It is often assumed that species which exhibit a greater propensity for
   dispersal are less susceptible to the impacts of habitat fragmentation;
   however, a growing body of literature suggests that such generalizations
   should be carefully evaluated as not all species appear to be equally
   sensitive to fragmentation. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, <link
   rid={''}b7{''}>Callens et al. (2011) take an innovative approach to
   compare contemporary estimates of dispersal from an extensive
   mark-recapture and patch occupancy data set with historical estimates
   derived from multilocus population genetic models for seven sympatric
   forest-dependent species in the Taita Hills, Africa. As has been
   observed for forest-dependent species from the Amazon, populations of
   sedentary species were more strongly differentiated and clustered when
   compared to those of more dispersive taxa. The most intriguing result
   recovered though, was that the five species with similar historical
   estimates of gene flow (dispersal) differed substantially in their
   contemporary dispersal rates, suggesting that for some species the
   propensity for dispersal has decreased over time. As a consequence, the
   authors suggest that post-fragmentation estimates of dispersal on their
   own may not be the best predictors of how habitat fragmentation could
   affect forest-dependent animal communities. This work significantly
   advances our understanding of the dynamics of habitat fragmentation and
   makes a strong case for the need to integrate data on historical
   processes with contemporary data.}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1803-1804}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species receive attention as manifestations of global
   ecological change and because of the effects that they may have on other
   organisms. They are commonly discussed in the context of the ecological
   perturbations or the human activities that permitted the invasion. There
   is also evidence, that there is an intrinsic component to biological
   invasions in that evolutionary changes of the invaders themselves can
   facilitate or limit invasions (<link rid={''}b13{''}>Lee 2002; Urban et
   al. 2007; Van Bocxlaer et al. 2010). Hence, teasing apart whether
   environmental change or changes of the organism foster invasions is an
   interesting field of research. Ample evidence for plants and animals
   documents that ecological change and human activities trigger range
   expansions and invasions, but questions regarding evolutionary change of
   invaders remain less explored although there are several reasons to
   believe it matters. Firstly, rapid evolutionary change is possible in
   timeframes relevant for contemporary biological invasions (<link
   rid={''}b9{''}>Hendry et al. 2007). Furthermore, population genetic
   modelling suggests that there are circumstances where the range
   expansion and colonization of empty spaces in the course of an invasion
   can induce evolutionary change in a way that is specific to invaders:
   the process of repeated founding out of marginal populations in the
   course of a range expansion can shift allele frequencies and has been
   referred to as allele surfing, which not only affects neutral genetic
   variance, but also fitness relevant traits (<link
   rid={''}b11{''}>Klopfstein et al. 2006; <link rid={''}b14{''}>Travis et
   al. 2007; <link rid={''}b3{''}>Burton \& Travis 2008). Importantly, this
   process poses a null model for evolutionary inference in invasive
   populations. It predicts conspicuous allele frequency changes in an
   expanding metapopulation unless migration homogenizes the gene pool.
   Despite this relevance, ideas about allele surfing rely heavily on
   modelling although some experimental evidence comes from studies that
   document the segregation of genetic variants in growing plaques of
   bacteria (<link rid={''}b8{''}>Hallatschek et al. 2007). To date, little
   empirical data is available that would reveal the migration processes
   that affect the establishment of gene pools at invasion fronts in
   natural systems. This aspect sets the study of <link
   rid={''}b2{''}>Bronnenhuber et al. (2011) apart. They quantify migration
   behind the expansion front of an invading fish and thus provide
   important baseline data for the interpretation of the emerging patterns
   of genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The comparison between neutral genetic differentiation (F-ST) and
   quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) is commonly used to test
   for signatures of selection in population divergence. However, there is
   an ongoing discussion about what F-ST actually measures, even resulting
   in some alternative metrics to express neutral genetic differentiation.
   If there is a problem with F-ST, this could have repercussions for its
   comparison with Q(ST) as well. We show that as the mutation rate of the
   neutral marker increases, F-ST decreases: a higher within-population
   heterozygosity (He) yields a lower F-ST value. However, the same is true
   for Q(ST): a higher mutation rate for the underlying QTL also results in
   a lower Q(ST) estimate. The effect of mutation rate is equivalent in
   Q(ST) and F-ST. Hence, the comparison between Q(ST) and F-ST remains
   valid, if one uses neutral markers whose mutation rates are not too high
   compared to those of quantitative traits. Usage of highly variable
   neutral markers such as hypervariable microsatellites can lead to
   serious biases and the incorrect inference that divergent selection has
   acted on populations. Much of the discussion on F-ST seems to stem from
   the misunderstanding that it measures the differentiation of
   populations, whereas it actually measures the fixation of alleles. In
   their capacity as measures of population differentiation, Hedrick's
   G'(ST) and Jost's D reach their maximum value of 1 when populations do
   not share alleles even when there remains variation within populations,
   which invalidates them for comparisons with Q(ST).}},

Abstract = {{In fragmented landscapes, small populations frequently go extinct and
   new ones are established with poorly understood consequences for genetic
   diversity and evolution of life history traits. Here, we apply
   functional genomic tools to an ecological model system, the well-studied
   metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly. We investigate how
   dispersal and colonization select upon existing genetic variation
   affecting life history traits by comparing common-garden reared 2-day
   adult females from new populations with those from established older
   populations. New-population females had higher expression of abdomen
   genes involved in egg provisioning and thorax genes involved in the
   maintenance of flight muscle proteins. Physiological studies confirmed
   that new-population butterflies have accelerated egg maturation,
   apparently regulated by higher juvenile hormone titer and angiotensin
   converting enzyme mRNA, as well as enhanced flight metabolism. Gene
   expression varied between allelic forms of two metabolic genes (Pgi and
   Sdhd), which themselves were associated with differences in flight
   metabolic rate, population age and population growth rate. These results
   identify likely molecular mechanisms underpinning life history variation
   that is maintained by extinction-colonization dynamics in

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation can restrict geneflow, reduce neighbourhood
   effective population size, and increase genetic drift and inbreeding in
   small, isolated habitat remnants. The extent to which habitat
   fragmentation leads to population fragmentation, however, differs among
   landscapes and taxa. Commonly, researchers use information on the
   current status of a species to predict population effects of habitat
   fragmentation. Such methods, however, do not convey information on
   species-specific responses to fragmentation. Here, we compare levels of
   past population differentiation, estimated from microsatellite
   genotypes, with contemporary dispersal rates, estimated from
   multi-strata capture-recapture models, to infer changes in mobility over
   time in seven sympatric, forest-dependent bird species of a Kenyan cloud
   forest archipelago. Overall, populations of sedentary species were more
   strongly differentiated and clustered compared to those of vagile ones,
   while geographical patterning suggested an important role of landscape
   structure in shaping genetic variation. However, five of seven species
   with broadly similar levels of genetic differentiation nevertheless
   differed substantially in their current dispersal rates. We conclude
   that post-fragmentation levels of vagility, without reference to past
   population connectivity, may not be the best predictor of how forest
   fragmentation affects the life history of forest-dependent species. As
   effective conservation strategies often hinge on accurate prediction of
   shifts in ecological and genetic relationships among populations,
   conservation practices based solely upon current population abundances
   or movements may, in the long term, prove to be inadequate.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal strategies are important mechanisms underlying the spatial
   distribution and colonizing ability of all mobile species. In the
   current study, we use highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to
   evaluate local dispersal and colonization dynamics of the round goby
   (Neogobius melanostomus), an aquatic invader expanding its range from
   lake to river environments in its introduced North American range.
   Genetic structure, genotype assignment and genetic diversity were
   compared among 1262 round gobies from 20 river and four lake sites in
   three Great Lakes tributaries. Our results indicate that a combination
   of short-distance diffusion and long-distance dispersal, collectively
   referred to as `stratified dispersal', is facilitating river
   colonization. Colonization proceeded upstream yearly (approximately 500
   m/year; 2005-2009) in one of two temporal replicates while genetic
   structure was temporally stable. Contiguous dispersal from the lake was
   observed in all three rivers with a substantial portion of river fish
   (7.3\%) identified as migrants. Genotype assignment indicated a separate
   introduction occurred upstream of the invasion front in one river.
   Genetic diversity was similar and relatively high among lake and
   recently colonized river populations, indicating that founder effects
   are mitigated through a dual-dispersal strategy. The remarkable success
   of round goby as an aquatic invader stresses the need for better
   diffusion models of secondary range expansion for presumably sessile
   invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Supplementation of wild salmonids with captive-bred fish is a common
   practice for both commercial and conservation purposes. However,
   evidence for lower fitness of captive-reared fish relative to wild fish
   has accumulated in recent years, diminishing the apparent effectiveness
   of supplementation as a management tool. To date, the mechanism(s)
   responsible for these fitness declines remain unknown. In this study, we
   showed with molecular parentage analysis that hatchery coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) had lower reproductive success than wild fish
   once they reproduced in the wild. This effect was more pronounced in
   males than in same-aged females. Hatchery spawned fish that were
   released as unfed fry (age 0), as well as hatchery fish raised for one
   year in the hatchery (released as smolts, age 1), both experienced lower
   lifetime reproductive success (RS) than wild fish. However, the subset
   of hatchery males that returned as 2-year olds (jacks) did not exhibit
   the same fitness decrease as males that returned as 3-year olds. Thus,
   we report three lines of evidence pointing to the absence of sexual
   selection in the hatchery as a contributing mechanism for fitness
   declines of hatchery fish in the wild: (i) hatchery fish released as
   unfed fry that survived to adulthood still had low RS relative to wild
   fish, (ii) age-3 male hatchery fish consistently showed a lower relative
   RS than female hatchery fish (suggesting a role for sexual selection),
   and (iii) age-2 jacks, which use a sneaker mating strategy, did not show
   the same declines as 3-year olds, which compete differently for females
   (again, implicating sexual selection).}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1870-1876}},

Abstract = {{Higher rates of dispersal in one sex than the other are widespread, and
   often attributed to the genetic advantages of reduced inbreeding. The
   direction of sex-biased dispersal shows strong phylogenetic conservatism
   (e.g. males disperse more than females in most mammals, but the reverse
   is true in most birds). By contrast, our genetic data reveal strong
   inter-population variation in the relative dispersal rates of two
   species of sea snakes (Laticauda saintgironsi and L. laticaudata) in the
   Noumea Lagoon of New Caledonia. Assignment methods using microsatellite
   data identified parallel variation in sex-specific dispersal in both
   species: dispersal was female-biased in the north-west of the sampling
   area (in islands far from the main island), but male-biased in the
   south-east (in islands closer to the main island). This flexibility may
   reflect sex differences in diets, with spatial variation in sex-specific
   resources generating spatial variation in sex-specific dispersal
   distances.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the impacts of inbreeding and genetic drift on fitness
   traits in fragmented populations is becoming a major goal in
   conservation biology. Such impacts occur at different levels and involve
   different sets of loci. Genetic drift randomly fixes slightly
   deleterious alleles leading to different fixation load among
   populations. By contrast, inbreeding depression arises from highly
   deleterious alleles in segregation within a population and creates
   variation among individuals. A popular approach is to measure
   correlations between molecular variation and phenotypic performances.
   This approach has been mainly used at the individual level to detect
   inbreeding depression within populations and sometimes at the population
   level but without consideration about the genetic processes measured.
   For the first time, we used in this study a molecular approach
   considering both the interpopulation and intrapopulation level to
   discriminate the relative importance of inbreeding depression vs.
   fixation load in isolated and non-fragmented populations of European
   tree frog (Hyla arborea), complemented with interpopulational crosses.
   We demonstrated that the positive correlations observed between genetic
   heterozygosity and larval performances on merged data were mainly caused
   by co-variations in genetic diversity and fixation load among
   populations rather than by inbreeding depression and segregating
   deleterious alleles within populations. Such a method is highly relevant
   in a conservation perspective because, depending on how populations lose
   fitness (inbreeding vs. fixation load), specific management actions may
   be designed to improve the persistence of populations.}},

Abstract = {{Species with a wide geographical distribution are often composed of
   distinct subgroups which may be adapted to their local environment.
   European trout (Salmo trutta species complex) provide an example of such
   a complex consisting of several genetically and ecologically distinct
   forms. However, trout populations are strongly influenced by human
   activities, and it is unclear to what extent neutral and adaptive
   genetic differences have persisted. We sampled 30 Swiss trout
   populations from heterogeneous environments along replicated altitudinal
   gradients in three major European drainages. More than 850 individuals
   were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci which included loci diagnostic
   for evolutionary lineages and candidate markers associated with
   temperature tolerance, reproductive timing and immune defence. We find
   that the phylogeographic structure of Swiss trout populations has not
   been completely erased by stocking. Distinct genetic clusters
   corresponding to the different drainages could be identified, although
   nonindigenous alleles were clearly present, especially in the two
   Mediterranean drainages. We also still detected neutral genetic
   differentiation within rivers which was often associated with the
   geographical distance between populations. Five loci showed evidence of
   divergent selection between populations with several drainage-specific
   patterns. Lineage-diagnostic markers, a marker linked to a quantitative
   trait locus for upper temperature tolerance in other salmonids and a
   marker linked to the major histocompatibility class I gene were
   implicated in local adaptation and some patterns were associated with
   altitude. In contrast, tentative evidence suggests a signal of balancing
   selection at a second immune relevant gene (TAP2). Our results confirm
   the persistence of both neutral and potentially adaptive genetic
   differences between trout populations in the face of massive
   human-mediated dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of quaternary glaciation in eastern China on local fanua and
   flora has been a topic of considerable interest. We used mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) sequence data and coalescent simulations to test two general
   biogeographic hypothesis related to the effects of Pleistocene climatic
   fluctuations for a widespread ophidian species (Gloydius brevicaudus) in
   eastern China and Korean Peninsula. The phylogenetic analysis revealed
   three major lineages, the southeast Coastal, Yangtze and North Lineages.
   The latter two are closely related and jointly form a continental
   lineage. Divergence dating and coalescent simulations indicate a Late
   Pliocene to Early Pleistocene divergence between lineages from the
   southeast coast and continental interior, followed by a mid-to-late
   Pleistocene divergence between lineages from the north and the
   middle-lower Yangtze Valley across East China, suggesting that all these
   lineages predated the last glacial maximum. An overlapping range between
   the two lineages within the continental lineage and a secondary contact
   associated with ecological transition zones on the margins of the North
   China Plain were also observed. These results show that vicariance
   patterns dominated the history of G. brevicaudus. Though the climatic
   events of the Pleistocene have had a marked effect on the historical
   distribution and intra-specific divergence of reptiles in China,
   coalescent and non-coalescent demographic analyses indicate that all
   lineages of G. brevicaudus seem not to have been adversely affected by
   glacial cycles during the Late Pleistocene, presumably because of an
   increase in the amount of climatically mild habitat in East Asia due to
   a decline in elevation and the development of monsoons since the Mid-End
   Pleistocene.}},

   effects of Late Quaternary climatic changes across a latitudinal
   gradient. Here, we evaluate the effects of climatic changes across a
   tropical latitudinal gradient and its implications to diversification of
   an Atlantic Forest (AF) endemic passerine. We studied the intraspecific
   diversification and historical demography of Sclerurus scansor, based on
   mitochondrial (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear (FIB7) gene sequences.
   Phylogenetic analyses recovered three well-supported clades associated
   with distinct latitudinal zones. Coalescent-based methods were applied
   to estimate divergence times and changes in effective population sizes.
   Estimates of divergence times indicate that intraspecific
   diversification took place during Middle-Late Pleistocene. Distinct
   demographic scenarios were identified, with the southern lineage
   exhibiting a clear signature of demographic expansion, while the central
   one remained more stable. The northern lineage, contrasting with LGH
   predictions, exhibited a clear sign of a recent bottleneck. Our results
   suggest that different AF regions reacted distinctly, even in opposite
   ways, under the same climatic period, producing simultaneously
   favourable scenarios for isolation and contact among populations.}},

Abstract = {{Common inhabitants of Antarctic and Subantarctic rocky shores, the
   limpet genus Nacella, includes 15 nominal species distributed in
   different provinces of the Southern Ocean. The Magellanic Province
   represents the area with the highest diversity of the genus.
   Phylogenetic reconstructions showed an absence of reciprocal monophyly
   and high levels of genetic identity among nominal species in this
   Province and therefore imply a recent diversification in southern South
   America. Because most of these taxa coexist along their distribution
   range with clear differences in their habitat preferences, Nacella is a
   suitable model to explore diversification mechanisms in an area highly
   affected by recurrent Pleistocene continental ice cap advances and
   retreats. Here, we present genetic and morphological comparisons among
   sympatric Magellanic nominal species of Nacella. We amplified a fragment
   of the COI gene for 208 individuals belonging to seven sympatric nominal
   species and performed geometric morphometric analyses of their shells.
   We detected a complete congruence between genetic and morphological
   results, leading us to suggest four groups of Nacella among seven
   analysed nominal species. Congruently, each of these groups was related
   to different habitat preferences such as bathymetric range and substrate
   type. A plausible explanation for these results includes an ecologically
   based allopatric speciation process in Nacella. Major climatic changes
   during the Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles may have enhanced
   differentiation processes. Finally, our results indicate that the
   systematics of the group requires a deep revision to re-evaluate the
   taxonomy of Nacella and to further understand the Pleistocene legacy of
   the glacial cycles in the southern tip of South America.}},

Abstract = {{Genealogies estimated from haplotypic genetic data play a prominent role
   in various biological disciplines in general and in phylogenetics,
   population genetics and phylogeography in particular. Several software
   packages have specifically been developed for the purpose of
   reconstructing genealogies from closely related, and hence, highly
   similar haplotype sequence data. Here, we use simulated data sets to
   test the performance of traditional phylogenetic algorithms,
   neighbour-joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood in
   estimating genealogies from nonrecombining haplotypic genetic data. We
   demonstrate that these methods are suitable for constructing genealogies
   from sets of closely related DNA sequences with or without migration. As
   genealogies based on phylogenetic reconstructions are fully resolved,
   but not necessarily bifurcating, and without reticulations, these
   approaches outperform widespread `network' constructing methods. In our
   simulations of coalescent scenarios involving panmictic, symmetric and
   asymmetric migration, we found that phylogenetic reconstruction methods
   performed well, while the statistical parsimony approach as implemented
   in TCS performed poorly. Overall, parsimony as implemented in the PHYLIP
   package performed slightly better than other methods. We further point
   out that we are not making the case that widespread `network'
   constructing methods are bad, but that traditional phylogenetic tree
   finding methods are applicable to haplotypic data and exhibit reasonable
   performance with respect to accuracy and robustness. We also discuss
   some of the problems of converting a tree to a haplotype genealogy, in
   particular that it is nonunique.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the genetic structure of populations of the widely
   distributed sea cucumber Holothuria (Holothuria) mammata Grube, 1840,
   and investigated the effects of marine barriers to gene flow and
   historical processes. Several potential genetic breaks were considered,
   which would separate the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins, the isolated
   Macaronesian Islands from the other locations analysed, and the Western
   Mediterranean and Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). We analysed
   mitochondrial 16S and COI gene sequences from 177 individuals from four
   Atlantic locations and four Mediterranean locations. Haplotype diversity
   was high (H = 0.9307 for 16S and 0.9203 for COI), and the haplotypes
   were closely related (pi = 0.0058 for 16S and 0.0071 for COI). The
   lowest genetic diversities were found in the Aegean Sea population. Our
   results showed that the COI gene was more variable and more useful for
   the detection of population structure than the 16S gene. The
   distribution of mtDNA haplotypes, the pairwise F-ST values and the
   results of exact tests and amova revealed: (i) a significant genetic
   break between the population in the Aegean Sea and those in the other
   locations, as supported by both mitochondrial genes, and (ii) weak
   differentiation of the Canary and Azores Islands from the other
   populations; however, the populations from the Macaronesian Islands,
   Algarve and West Mediterranean could be considered to be a panmictic
   metapopulation. Isolation by distance was not identified in H. (H.)
   mammata. Historical events behind the observed findings, together with
   the current oceanographic patterns, were proposed and discussed as the
   main factors that determine the population structure and genetic
   signature of H. (H.) mammata.}},

Abstract = {{The capelin (Mallotus villosus) is a widespread marine fish species for
   which previous work has identified geographically distinct mtDNA clades,
   the frontiers of which are well within adult and larval dispersal
   capabilities. Here, we use AFLPs to test for the presence of nuclear
   gene flow among clades. In addition, we evaluate genetic structuring
   within one clade, the Northwest Atlantic (NWA). We found that each of
   the mtDNA clades corresponds with a unique nuclear DNA genetic cluster.
   Within the NWA clade, we detected individuals with small but significant
   amounts of genetic ancestry from other clades, likely due to historical
   introgression. Further support for historical introgression comes from
   analyses of variance in locus-specific differentiation, which support
   introgression between some clades and divergence without gene flow
   between others. Within the NWA, we identified two genetic clusters that
   correspond to sites in geographically adjacent areas. However, these
   clusters differ primarily at `outlier' loci, and a genetic subdivision
   (K = 2) was not supported by genetic clustering programs using neutral
   loci. Significant neutral F-ST differentiation was found only between
   sites that otherwise differed at outlier loci. Thus, these populations
   may be in the initial stages of `isolation by adaptation'. These results
   suggest strong between-clade reproductive isolation despite
   opportunities for gene flow and support the hypothesis that selection
   can contribute to divergence in otherwise `open' systems.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its widespread distribution and high levels of phylogenetic
   diversity, microbes are poorly understood creatures. We applied a
   phylogenetic ecology approach in the Kingdom Euryarchaeota (Archaea) to
   gain insight into the environmental distribution and evolutionary
   history of one of the most ubiquitous and largely unknown microbial
   groups. We compiled 16S rRNA gene sequences from our own sequence
   libraries and public genetic databases for two of the most widespread
   mesophilic Euryarchaeota clades, Lake Dagow Sediment (LDS) and Rice
   Cluster-V (RC-V). The inferred population history indicated that both
   groups have undergone specific nonrandom evolution within environments,
   with several noteworthy habitat transition events. Remarkably, the LDS
   and RC-V groups had enormous levels of genetic diversity when compared
   with other microbial groups, and proliferation of sequences within each
   single clade was accompanied by significant ecological differentiation.
   Additionally, the freshwater Euryarchaeota counterparts unexpectedly
   showed high phylogenetic diversity, possibly promoted by their
   environmental adaptability and the heterogeneous nature of freshwater
   ecosystems. The temporal phylogenetic diversification pattern of these
   freshwater Euryarchaeota was concentrated both in early times and
   recently, similarly to other much less diverse but deeply sampled
   archaeal groups, further stressing that their genetic diversity is a
   function of environment plasticity. For the vast majority of living
   beings on Earth (i.e. the uncultured microorganisms), how they differ in
   the genetic or physiological traits used to exploit the environmental
   resources is largely unknown. Inferring population history from 16S rRNA
   gene-based molecular phylogenies under an ecological perspective may
   shed light on the intriguing relationships between lineage, environment,
   evolution and diversity in the microbial world.}},

Abstract = {{Trees' long lifespan, long-distance dispersal abilities and high
   year-to-year variability in fecundity are thought to have pervasive
   consequences for the demographic and genetic structure of recruited
   seedlings. However, we still lack experimental studies quantifying the
   respective roles of spatial processes such as restricted seed and pollen
   dispersal and temporal processes such as mast seeding on patterns of
   regeneration. Dynamics of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedling
   recruitment was monitored in three plots from 2004 to 2006. Six
   polymorphic microsatellite genetic markers were used to characterize
   seedlings and their potential parents in a 7.2-ha stand. These seedlings
   were shown to result from 12 years of recruitment, with one predominant
   year of seedling recruitment in 2002 and several years without
   significant recruitment. Using a spatially explicit mating model based
   on parentage assignment, short average dispersal distances for seed
   (delta(s) = 10.9 m) and pollen (43.7 m < delta(p) < 57.3 m) were found,
   but there was also a non-negligible immigration rate from outside the
   plot (m(s) = 20.5\%; 71.6\% < m(p) < 77.9\%). Hierarchical analyses of
   seedling genetic structure showed that (i) most of the genetic variation
   was within plots; (ii) the genetic differentiation among seedling plots
   was significant (F-ST = 2.6\%) while (iii) there was no effect of
   year-to-year seed rain variation on genetic structure. In addition, no
   significant effect of genetic structure on mortality was detected. The
   consequences of these results for the prediction of population dynamics
   at ecological timescales are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In genetically diverse insect societies (polygynous or polyandrous
   queens), the production of new queens can set the ground for competition
   among lineages. This competition can be very intense when workers can
   reproduce using thelytoky as worker lineages that manage to produce new
   queens gain a huge benefit. Selection at the individual level might then
   lead to the evolution of cheating genotypes, i.e. genotypes that
   reproduce more than their fair share. We studied the variation in
   reproductive success among worker patrilines in the thelytokous and
   highly polyandrous ant Cataglyphis cursor. Workers produce new queens by
   thelytoky in orphaned colonies. The reproductive success of each
   patriline was assessed in 13 orphaned colonies using genetic analysis of
   433 workers and 326 worker-produced queens. Our results show that
   patrilines contributed unequally to queen production in half of the
   colonies, and the success of patrilines was function of their
   frequencies in workers. However, over all colonies, we observed a
   significant difference in the distribution of patrilines between workers
   and worker-produced queens, and this difference was significant in three
   of 13 colonies. In addition, six colonies contained a low percentage of
   foreign workers (drifters), and in one colony, they produced a
   disproportionably high number of queens. Hence, we found some evidence
   for the occurrence of rare cheating genotypes. Nevertheless, cheating
   appears to be less pronounced than in the Cape Honey bee, a species with
   a similar reproductive system. We argue that worker reproduction by
   parthenogenesis might not be common in natural populations of C. cursor.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic interactions between macrotermitine termites and their fungal
   symbionts have a moderate degree of specificity. Consistent with
   horizontal symbiont transmission, host switching has been frequent over
   evolutionary time so that single termite species can often be associated
   with several fungal symbionts. However, even in the few termite lineages
   that secondarily adopted vertical symbiont transmission, the fungal
   symbionts are not monophyletic. We addressed this paradox by studying
   differential transmission of fungal symbionts by alate male and female
   reproductives, and the genetic population structure of Termitomyces
   fungus gardens across 74 colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus in four west
   and central African countries. We confirm earlier, more limited, studies
   showing that the Termitomyces symbionts of M. bellicosus are normally
   transmitted vertically and clonally by dispersing males. We also
   document that the symbionts associated with this termite species belong
   to three main lineages that do not constitute a monophyletic group. The
   most common lineage occurs over the entire geographical region that we
   studied, including west, central and southern Africa, where it is also
   associated with the alternative termite hosts Macrotermes subhyalinus
   and Macrotermes natalensis. While Termitomyces associated with these
   alternative hosts are horizontally transmitted and recombine freely, the
   genetic population structure of the same Termitomyces associated with M.
   bellicosus is consistent with predominantly clonal reproduction and only
   occasional recombination. This implies that the genetic population
   structure of Termitomyces is controlled by the termite host and not by
   the Termitomyces symbiont.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation supplies the raw material for adaptation, evolution
   and survival of populations and has therefore been a key focus of
   conservation biology ever since its foundation (<link
   rid={''}b7{''}>Soule 1985). In previous decades, the neutral component
   of genetic diversity (generated by mutation and shaped by drift) has
   been the subject of intense scientific research, fuelled by the
   increasing availability of molecular markers. On the other hand, the
   adaptive component of genetic diversity, which is shaped by the action
   of natural selection, has long remained elusive and difficult to assess,
   especially at small spatial or temporal scales (<link
   rid={''}b3{''}>Ouborg et al. 2010). Fortunately, new technological and
   methodological developments now make it possible to identify loci in the
   genome that are influenced by selection, and thus to get a more complete
   view of genetic diversity. One article featured in this issue of
   Molecular Ecology is a good example of this recent breakthrough. <link
   rid={''}b4{''}>Richter-Boix et al. (2011) examined a network of moor
   frog populations breeding in contrasting habitats in order to understand
   how landscape features influence patterns of genetic variation. They
   combined information from both neutral markers and loci putatively under
   selection to quantify the relative roles of selection and isolation in
   the evolution of fine-scale local adaptations in these populations. This
   study nicely illustrates how data on polymorphisms of neutral and
   adaptive loci can now be judiciously synthesized to help identify the
   best strategies for preserving adaptive variation, and more generally to
   enlighten conservation and population-management plans.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Until a few years ago, epigenetics was a field of research that had
   nothing to do with ecology and that virtually no ecologist had ever
   heard of. This is now changing, as more and more ecologists learn about
   epigenetic processes and their potential ecological and evolutionary
   relevance, and a new research field of ecological epigenetics is
   beginning to take shape. One question that is particularly intriguing
   ecologists is to what extent epigenetic variation is an additional, and
   hitherto overlooked, source of natural variation in ecologically
   important traits. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, <link
   rid={''}b9{''}>Herrera \& Bazaga (2011) provide one of the first
   attempts to truly address this question in an ecological setting. They
   study variation of DNA methylation in a wild population of the rare,
   long-lived violet Viola cazorlensis, and they use these data to explore
   interrelations between environmental, genetic and epigenetic variation,
   and in particular the extent to which these factors are related to
   long-term differences in herbivore damage among plants. They find
   substantial epigenetic variation among plant individuals. Interestingly,
   this epigenetic variation is significantly correlated with long-term
   differences in herbivory, but only weakly with herbivory-related DNA
   sequence variation, which suggests that besides habitat, substrate and
   genetic variation, epigenetic variation may be an additional, and at
   least partly independent, factor influencing plant-herbivore
   interactions in the field. Although the study by <link
   rid={''}b9{''}>Herrera \& Bazaga (2011) raises at least as many new
   questions as it answers, it is a pioneering example of how epigenetics
   can be incorporated into ecological field studies, and it illustrates
   the value and potential novel insights to be gained from such efforts.}},

Abstract = {{A key objective of population genomics is to identify portions of the
   genome that have been shaped by natural selection rather than by neutral
   divergence. A previously recognized but underappreciated challenge to
   this objective is that observations of allele frequencies across genomes
   in natural populations often correspond to a single, unreplicated
   instance of the outcome of evolution. This is because the composition of
   each individual genomic region and population is expected to be the
   outcome of a unique array of evolutionary processes. Given a single
   observation, inference of the evolutionary processes that led to the
   observed state of a locus is associated with considerable uncertainty.
   This constraint on inference can be ameliorated by utilizing
   multi-allelic (e.g. DNA haplotypes) rather than bi-allelic markers, by
   analysing two or more populations with certain models and by utilizing
   studies of replicated experimental evolution. Future progress in
   population genomics will follow from research that recognizes the `n = 1
   constraint' and that utilizes appropriate and explicit evolutionary
   models for analysis.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main questions in evolutionary and conservation biology is
   how geographical and environmental features of the landscape shape
   neutral and adaptive genetic variation in natural populations. The
   identification of genomic polymorphisms that account for adaptive
   variation can aid in finding candidate loci for local adaptation.
   Consequently, a comparison of spatial patterns in neutral markers and
   loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow,
   genetic drift and selection at the landscape scale. Many amphibians
   breed in wetlands, which differ in environmental conditions and in the
   degree of isolation, enhancing the potential for local adaptation. We
   used microsatellite markers to measure genetic differentiation among 17
   local populations of Rana arvalis breeding in a network of wetlands. We
   found that locus RC08604 deviated from neutral expectations, suggesting
   that it is a good candidate for directional selection. We used a genetic
   network analysis to show that the allele distribution in this locus is
   correlated with habitat characteristics, whereas this was not the case
   at neutral markers that displayed a different allele distribution and
   population network in the study area. The graph approach illustrated the
   genomic heterogeneity (neutral loci vs. the candidate locus for
   directional selection) of gene exchange and genetic divergence among
   populations under directional selection. Limited gene flow between
   wetlands was only observed at the candidate genomic region under
   directional selection. RC08604 is partially located inside an
   up-regulated thyroid-hormone receptor (TR beta) gene coordinating the
   expression of other genes during metamorphosis and appears to be linked
   with variation in larval life-history traits found among R. arvalis
   populations. We suggest that directional selection on genes coding
   larval life-history traits is strong enough to maintain the divergence
   in these genomic regions, reducing the effective recombination of
   locally adapted alleles but not in other regions of the genome.
   Integrating this knowledge into conservation plans at the landscape
   scale will improve the design of management strategies to preserve
   adaptive genetic diversity in wetland networks.}},

Abstract = {{The association between population dynamics and genetic variability is
   of fundamental importance for both evolutionary and conservation
   biology. We combined long-term population monitoring and molecular
   genetic data from 123 offspring and their parents at 28 microsatellite
   loci to investigate changes in genetic diversity over 14 cohorts in a
   small and relatively isolated population of mountain goats (Oreamnos
   americanus) during a period of demographic increase. Offspring
   heterozygosity decreased while parental genetic similarity and
   inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) increased over the study period
   (1995-2008). Immigrants introduced three novel alleles into the
   population and matings between residents and immigrants produced more
   heterozygous offspring than local crosses, suggesting that immigration
   can increase population genetic variability. The population experienced
   genetic drift over the study period, reflected by a reduced allelic
   richness over time and an `isolation-by-time' pattern of genetic
   structure. The temporal decline of individual genetic diversity despite
   increasing population size probably resulted from a combination of
   genetic drift due to small effective population size, inbreeding and
   insufficient counterbalancing by immigration. This study highlights the
   importance of long-term genetic monitoring to understand how demographic
   processes influence temporal changes of genetic diversity in long-lived
   organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Forests of the Dahomey Gap are considered as refugia for many species.
   They play a crucial role in providing ecosystem services in an area
   devoid of forests. However, the impact of the way they are managed on
   the biodiversity they host has barely been investigated. Wild yams
   existing in these forests play a crucial role in maintaining the genetic
   diversity of cultivated yams. Indeed, studies of farmer practices have
   shown that, by way of ennoblement, wild yams collected and selected in
   the forests and old fallow areas are integrated into the cultivated
   pool. However, the genetic structure of wild yams is poorly understood.
   Using nine microsatellite loci, we investigated the population genetics
   of Dioscorea praehensilis in five forests in Benin, involving different
   management strategies and bioclimatic areas. Populations of D.
   praehensilis were strongly differentiated, consistent with an ancient
   separation of the forests. While the D. praehensilis population in a
   holly forest was undergoing mutation and drift equilibrium, the
   population collected from the most conserved forest was in a bottleneck.
   Moreover, in two forests with different management strategies,
   accessions from other forests were found, resulting from the
   displacement of yams following farmer migrations. No isolation by
   distance was detected, but a differentiation was found between
   populations of the Sudano-Guinean climate and the Guineo-Congolian
   climate. Our findings suggest differentiation due to forest isolations
   under past climatic conditions and more recent tuber flow through
   anthropogenic impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-biased dispersal is observed in many taxa, but few studies have
   compared sex-biased dispersal among and within populations. We addressed
   the magnitude and habitat dependency of sex-biased dispersal in social
   African striped mice by separating group-related from population-related
   genetic variance to understand the contribution of each sex to deme
   structure. As dispersal over unoccupied habitat is likely to be more
   costly than dispersal within a population, we predicted that individuals
   leaving the natal population have a lower body condition, being inferior
   to heavier territorial individuals. Fine-scale genetic structure was
   detected in both sexes. Female relatedness decreased continuously from R
   = 0.21 at 25 m to zero at 500 m. Maximum male relatedness R = 0.05 was
   constant at distances between 25 and 75 m, becoming zero at 100 m.
   Genetic variance (F-ST) among seven locations was significantly higher
   in females than in males, while inbreeding estimates (F-IS) were
   significantly higher in males than in females. Assignment tests
   estimated significantly more migrants among males, while Bayesian
   clustering estimated only a single genetic unit cluster for males among
   the seven locations. The mean body mass of migrant males (44 g) was
   significantly lower than for males that remained resident and thus
   dispersed within their sub-population (48 g). Combined, the results
   showed habitat-independent male-biased dispersal and high female
   philopatry, and suggested that body condition was more important than
   kinship in male dispersal decisions. We suggest that locally inferior
   males are important for gene flow between sub-populations. Thus, males
   might follow alternative dispersal tactics.}},

Abstract = {{Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) has been used as a model organism to
   develop and test important ecological and evolutionary concepts and is
   also a major pest of grain and grain products globally. This beetle
   species is assumed to be a good colonizer of grain storages through
   anthropogenic movement of grain, and active dispersal by flight is
   considered unlikely. Studies using T. castaneum have therefore used
   confined or walking insects. We combine an ecological study of dispersal
   with an analysis of gene flow using microsatellites to investigate the
   spatiotemporal dynamics and adult flight of T. castaneum in an
   ecological landscape in eastern Australia. Flying beetles were caught in
   traps at grain storages and in fields at least 1 km from the nearest
   stored grain at regular intervals for an entire year. Significantly more
   beetles were trapped at storages than in fields, and almost no beetles
   were caught in native vegetation reserves many kilometres from the
   nearest stored grain. Genetic differentiation between beetles caught at
   storages and in fields was low, indicating that although T. castaneum is
   predominantly aggregated around grain storages, active dispersal takes
   place to the extent that significant gene flow occurs between them,
   mitigating founder effects and genetic drift. By combining ecological
   and molecular techniques, we reveal much higher levels of active
   dispersal through adult flight in T. castaneum than previously thought.
   We conclude that the implications of adult flight to previous and future
   studies on this model organism warrant consideration.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Approximately one quarter of zooxanthellate coral species have a depth
   distribution from shallow waters (< 30 m) down to mesophotic depths of
   30-60 m. The deeper populations of such species are less likely to be
   affected by certain environmental perturbations, including high
   temperature/high irradiance causing coral bleaching. This has led to the
   hypothesis that deep populations may serve as refuges and a source of
   recruits for shallow reef habitats. The extent of vertical connectivity
   of reef coral species, however, is largely unquantified. Using 10 coral
   host microsatellite loci and sequences of the host mtDNA putative
   control region, as well as ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ITS2 sequences of the
   coral's algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium), we examine population
   structure, connectivity and symbiont specificity in the brooding coral
   Seriatopora hystrix across a depth profile in both northwest (Scott
   Reef) and northeast Australia (Yonge Reef). Strong genetic structuring
   over depth was observed in both regions based on the microsatellite
   loci; however, Yonge Reef exhibited an additional partitioning of mtDNA
   lineages (associated with specific symbiont ITS2 types), whereas Scott
   Reef was dominated by a single mtDNA lineage (with no apparent
   host-symbiont specificity). Evidence for recruitment of larvae of deep
   water origin into shallow habitats was found at Scott Reef, suggesting
   that recovery of shallow water habitats may be aided by migration from
   deep water refuges. Conversely, no migration from the genetically
   divergent deep slope populations into the shallow habitats was evident
   at Yonge Reef, making recovery of shallow habitats from deeper waters at
   this location highly unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics, which combines population genetics, landscape
   ecology and spatial statistics, has emerged recently as a new discipline
   that can be used to assess how landscape features or environmental
   variables can influence gene flow and spatial genetic variation. We
   applied this approach to the invasive plant pathogenic fungus
   Mycosphaerella fijiensis, which causes black leaf streak disease of
   banana. Around 880 isolates were sampled within a 50 x 50 km area
   located in a fragmented banana production zone in Cameroon that includes
   several potential physical barriers to gene flow. Two clustering
   algorithms and a new F(ST)-based procedure were applied to define the
   number of genetic entities and their spatial domain without a priori
   assumptions. Two populations were clearly delineated, and the genetic
   discontinuity appeared sharp but asymmetric. Interestingly, no landscape
   features matched this genetic discontinuity, and no isolation by
   distance (IBD) was found within populations. Our results suggest that
   the genetic structure observed in this production area reflects the
   recent history of M. fijiensis expansion in Cameroon rather than
   resulting from contemporary gene flow. Finally, we discuss the influence
   of the suspected high effective population size for such an organism on
   (i) the absence of an IBD signal, (ii) the characterization of
   contemporary gene-flow events through assignation methods of analysis
   and (iii) the evolution of the genetic discontinuity detected in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in ecologically important features of organisms is
   a crucial element in ecology and evolution, yet disentangling its
   underlying causes is difficult in natural populations. We applied a
   genomic scan approach using amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (AFLP) markers to quantify the genetic basis of long-term individual
   differences in herbivory by mammals at a wild population of the violet
   Viola cazorlensis monitored for two decades. In addition,
   methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analyses were used
   to investigate the association between browsing damage and epigenetic
   characteristics of individuals, an aspect that has been not previously
   explored for any wild plant. Structural equation modelling was used to
   identify likely causal structures linking genotypes, epigenotypes and
   herbivory. Individuals of V. cazorlensis differed widely in the
   incidence of browsing mammals over the 20-year study period. Six AFLP
   markers (1.6\% of total) were significantly related to herbivory,
   accounting altogether for 44\% of population-wide variance in herbivory
   levels. MSAP analyses revealed considerable epigenetic variation among
   individuals, and differential browsing damage was significantly related
   to variation in multilocus epigenotypes. In addition, variation across
   plants in epigenetic characteristics was related to variation in several
   herbivory-related AFLP markers. Statistical comparison of alternative
   causal models suggested that individual differences in herbivory are the
   outcome of a complex causal structure where genotypes and epigenotypes
   are interconnected and have direct and indirect effects on herbivory.
   Insofar as methylation states of MSAP markers influential on herbivory
   are transgenerationally heritable, herbivore-driven evolutionary changes
   at the study population will involve correlated changes in genotypic and
   epigenotypic distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic differentiation in thermal adaptation can result from a
   trade-off between the performance of organisms across different
   temperatures or from the accumulation of deleterious mutations. In this
   experiment, we assayed thermal sensitivity of 138 genetically distinct
   Mycosphaerella graminicola isolates sampled from five host populations
   in four locations under two temperature regimes (22 and 15 degrees C)
   and found significant differences in growth rate and response to
   temperature among populations. On average, genetic differentiation
   accounted for more than 50\% of phenotypic variation in thermal
   adaptation while plasticity contributed less than a quarter of
   phenotypic variation. Populations originating from warm places performed
   better under the high-temperature regime and had a larger positive
   response to increasing temperature. Pairwise population differentiation
   (Q(ST)) in temperature sensitivity, measured by taking the ratio of
   growth rates at 22 to 15 degrees C, was positively and significantly
   correlated to the pairwise difference in annual mean temperature at the
   collection sites. Because overall Q(ST) in temperature sensitivity was
   significantly higher than overall G(ST) in neutral restriction fragment
   length polymorphism loci, we believe that the primary mechanism
   underlying this thermal adaptation is antagonistic pleiotropy. Our
   results indicate that temperature sensitivity is a better indicator of
   thermal adaptation than growth rate at individual temperatures.}},

Title = {{Scanning the genome for gene SNPs related to climate adaptation and

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Outlier detection methods were used to scan the genome of the boreal
   conifer black spruce (Picea mariana {[}Mill.] B.S.P.) for gene
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially involved in
   adaptations to temperature and precipitation variations. The scan
   involved 583 SNPs from 313 genes potentially playing adaptive roles.
   Differentiation estimates among population groups defined following
   variation in temperature and precipitation were moderately high for
   adaptive quantitative characters such as the timing of budset or tree
   height (Q(ST) = 0.189-0.314). Average differentiation estimates for gene
   SNPs were null, with F-ST values of 0.005 and 0.006, respectively, among
   temperature and precipitation population groups. Using two detection
   approaches, a total of 26 SNPs from 25 genes distributed among 11 of the
   12 linkage groups of black spruce were detected as outliers with F-ST as
   high as 0.078. Nearly half of the outlier SNPs were located in exons and
   half of those were nonsynonymous. The functional annotations of genes
   carrying outlier SNPs and regression analyses between the frequencies of
   these SNPs and climatic variables supported their implication in
   adaptive processes. Several genes carrying outlier SNPs belonged to gene
   families previously found to harbour outlier SNPs in a reproductively
   isolated but largely sympatric congeneric species, suggesting
   differential subfunctionalization of gene duplicates. Selection
   coefficient estimates (S) were moderate but well above the magnitude of
   drift (>> 1/N-e), indicating that the signature of natural selection
   could be detected at the nucleotide level despite the recent
   establishment of these populations during the Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{Several marine hybrid zones have been described and studied during the
   last years. Assessing the movements of extending hybrid zones is central
   to improve our understanding of evolutionary processes. We have
   re-examined the hybrid zone between Solea aegyptiaca and Solea
   senegalensis that was first described 22 years ago in northern Tunisia
   when introgressed S. senegalensis individuals were found in the Gulf of
   Tunis, whereas locally caught S. aegyptiaca were genetically pure. Six
   population samples harvested both inside and outside the area where the
   two fish species coexist were genotyped for allozymes and exon-primed
   intron length polymorphism. Both types of markers were congruent and
   revealed that introgression takes place indeed in both directions. A
   high introgression level (36.4\%) in the Bizerta lagoon and much less
   outside indicate that this is the main area where hybridization occurs
   while introgression clines towards the south in S. aegyptiaca and
   towards the north in S. senegalensis plead in favour of the existence of
   a unimodal hybrid zone. The higher introgression level calculated in the
   current study (when compared to 16\% reported formerly) and the newly
   found introgressed S. aegyptiaca in Bizerta lagoon seem to indicate that
   the genetic exchanges occurring between the two taxa are evolving and
   not stabilized yet.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleotide polymorphisms at genomic regions including 17 nuclear loci,
   two chloroplast and one mitochondrial DNA fragments were used to study
   the speciation history of three pine species: dwarf mountain pine (Pinus
   mugo), peat-bog pine (P. uliginosa) and Scots pine (P. sylvestris). We
   set out to investigate three specific speciation scenarios: (I) P.
   uliginosa is a homoploid hybrid between the other two, (II) the species
   have evolved without gene flow after divergence and (III) there has been
   substantial gene flow between the species since their divergence.
   Overall, the genetic data suggest that P. mugo and P. uliginosa share
   the same gene pool (average net divergence of 0.0001) and that the
   phenotypic differences (e.g. growth form) are most likely due to very
   limited areas of the genome. P. mugo and P. uliginosa are more diverged
   from P. sylvestris than from each other (average net divergence of
   0.0027 and 0.0026, respectively). The nucleotide patterns can best be
   explained by the divergence with migration speciation scenario, although
   the hybrid speciation scenario with small genomic contribution from P.
   sylvestris cannot be completely ruled out. We suggest that the large
   amount of shared polymorphisms between the pine taxa and the lack of
   monophyly at all loci studied between P. sylvestris and P. mugo-P.
   uliginosa can largely be explained by relatively recent speciation
   history and large effective population sizes but also by interspecific
   gene flow. These closely related pine taxa form an excellent system for
   searching for loci involved in adaptive variation as they are
   differentiated in phenotype and ecology but have very similar genetic
   background.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographic patterns in wide-ranging species in southern Africa
   remain largely unexplored, especially in areas north of South Africa.
   Here, we investigate population structuring, demographic history, and
   the colonization pattern of the western rock skink (Trachylepis
   sulcata), a rock-dwelling species with a range extending from
   southwestern South Africa into Angola. Using 1056 bp from the
   mitochondrial marker ND2 and > 2.5 kb from three nuclear genes (EXPH5,
   KIF24, RAG-1), we constructed allele networks, generated extended
   Bayesian skyline plots and performed population clustering analyses.
   Analyses of historical demographic patterns show an overall southward
   range expansion from Northern Namibia into Southern Namibia and South
   Africa, although we find contrasting genetic breaks across these
   geographic regions using nuclear and mitochondrial data. We suggest that
   mtDNA has introgressed across a nuclear break corresponding to the
   Knersvlakte region of South Africa, a previously proposed biogeographic
   barrier for rupicolous species. This pattern of mitochondrial variation
   contrasts sharply to that of other South African taxa previously
   investigated, which all show significant mtDNA differentiation across
   the Knersvlakte region. Additionally, while other taxa show divergences
   dating to the Pliocene, T. sulcata appears to be a recent arrival in
   southern Africa, having crossed this barrier and colonized South Africa
   in the mid-Pleistocene. The complex phylogeographic history of T.
   sulcata corroborates the intricate patterns of genetic variation found
   in South African taxa and provides novel insight into historical
   processes affecting species distributed across Namibia.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge about genetic mating systems and the underlying causes for
   and consequences of variation in reproductive success has substantially
   improved in recent years. When linked to longitudinal population
   studies, cross-generational pedigrees across wild populations can help
   answer a wide suite of questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. We
   used microsatellite markers and exhaustive sampling of two successive
   adult generations to obtain population-wide estimates of individual
   reproductive output of males and females in a natural population of the
   Neotropical frog Allobates femoralis (Aromobatidae), a pan-Amazonian
   species that features prolonged iteroparous breeding, male
   territoriality and male parental care. Parentage analysis revealed a
   polygynandrous mating system in which high proportions of males (35.5\%)
   and females (56.0\%) produced progeny that survived until adulthood.
   Despite contrasting reproductive strategies, successfully reproducing
   males and females had similar numbers of mating partners that sired the
   adult progeny (both sexes: median 2; range 1-6); the numbers of their
   offspring that reached adulthood were also similar (both sexes: median
   2; range 1-8). Measures of reproductive skew indicate selection on males
   only for their opportunity to breed. Reproductive success was
   significantly higher in territorial than in nonterritorial males, but
   unrelated to territory size in males or to body size in both sexes. We
   hypothesize that female polyandry in this species has evolved because of
   enhanced offspring survival when paternal care is allocated to multiple
   partners.}},

Abstract = {{We employ molecular methods to profile the diet of the little brown bat,
   Myotis lucifugus, and describe spatial and temporal changes in diet over
   their maternity season. We identified 61 prey species of insects and 5
   species of arachnid. The largest proportion of prey (similar to 32\%)
   were identified as species of the mass-emerging Ephemeroptera (mayfly)
   genus Caenis. Bats roosting in agricultural settings had lower dietary
   richness than those occupying a roost located on a forest fragment in a
   conservation area. We detected temporal fluctuations in diet over the
   maternity season. Dipteran (fly) species dominated the diet early in the
   season, replaced later by species of mayfly. Because our methodology
   provides species-level identification of prey, we were able to isolate
   environmental indicator species in the diet and draw conclusions about
   the location and type of their foraging habitat and the health of these
   aquatic systems. The species detected suggested that the bats use
   variable habitats; members of one agricultural roost foraged on insects
   originating in rivers or streams while those in another agricultural
   roost and the forest roost fed on insects from pond or lake
   environments. All source water for prey was of fair to good quality,
   though no species detected are intolerant of pollution thus the habitat
   cannot be classified as pristine. Our study outlines a model system to
   investigate the abiotic and biotic interactions between habitat factors
   through this simple food chain to the top predator.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1781-1793}},

Abstract = {{In insect societies, worker vs. queen development (reproductive caste)
   is typically governed by environmental factors, but many Pogonomyrmex
   seed-harvester ants exhibit strict genetic caste determination,
   resulting in an obligate mutualism between two reproductively isolated
   lineages. Same-lineage matings produce fertile queens while
   alternate-lineage matings produce sterile workers. Because new virgin
   queens mate randomly with multiple males of each lineage type, and both
   worker and queen phenotypes are required for colony growth and future
   reproduction, fitness is influenced by the relative frequency of each
   lineage involved in the mutualistic breeding system. While models based
   solely on frequency-dependent selection predict the convergence of
   lineage frequencies towards equal (0.5/0.5), we surveyed the lineage
   ratios of 49 systems across the range of the mutualism and found that
   the global lineage frequency differed significantly from equal. Multiple
   regression analysis of our system survey data revealed that the density
   and relative frequency of one lineage decreases at lower elevations,
   while the frequency of the alternate lineage increases with total colony
   density. While the production of the first worker cohort is largely
   frequency dependent, relying on the random acquisition of worker-biased
   sperm stores, subsequent colony growth is independent of lineage
   frequency. We provide a simulation model showing that a net ecological
   advantage held by one lineage can lead to the maintenance of stable but
   asymmetric lineage frequencies. Collectively, these findings suggest
   that a combination of frequency-dependent and frequency-independent
   mechanisms can generate many different localized and independently
   evolving system equilibria.}},

Abstract = {{As adults, Atlantic eels (Anguilla rostrata in the Americas and Anguilla
   anguilla in Europe) are tubular slime-covered fish that spend most of
   their catadromous life cycle in coastal environs before swimming far out
   to sea to reproduce, as part of an intergenerational migratory circuit
   that provides an interesting reversal of the pattern displayed by adult
   anadromous salmon that live mostly in the ocean but then migrate long
   distances to spawn in freshwater streams. Earlier genetic findings on
   Atlantic eels involved specimens collected across their broad
   continental ranges and generally indicated that conspecifics probably
   engage in panmictic or quasi-panmictic spawning, from which arise
   leaf-shaped leptocephaus larvae that then disperse back to coastal
   locations more or less at random with respect to the widespread
   geographical origins of the parental genes they carry. In this issue,
   Als et al. (2011) add exciting information about this peculiar
   life-history pattern of catadromous Atlantic eels by extending the
   genetic analyses to eel larvae collected from the Sargasso Sea, the
   oceanic area where both species spawn. Results help to confirm standard
   textbook wisdom that these catadromous eels are nearly unique in the
   biological world by having both broad geographical distributions and yet
   displaying intraspecific near-panmixia.}},

Abstract = {{Natural hybridization between closely related taxa is frequent in many
   organismal groups, yet it has long been perceived as a force preventing
   diversification and speciation, especially so in animals. In recent
   years, growing evidence in favour of hybridization facilitating adaptive
   divergence has accumulated (<link rid={''}b1{''}>Mallet 2007; <link
   rid={''}b2{''}>Mavarez \& Linares 2008; <link rid={''}b3{''}>Nolte \&
   Tautz 2010). Homoploid hybrid speciation (the formation of hybrid
   lineages without changes in chromosome number) occurs when distinct
   species come into contact, hybridize, and at least in part of their
   range, produce hybrid swarms. If the hybrid genotypes can then colonize
   areas of the adaptive landscape inaccessible to ancestral species, they
   may eventually form new distinct lineages, reproductively isolated from
   their ancestors. Invasive sculpins (Cottus sp.) are one of a few good
   examples of homoploid hybrid speciation in animals. In this issue, <link
   rid={''}b9{''}>Stemshorn et al. (2011) identified three distinct hybrid
   lineages, which have emerged out of a secondary contact situation of
   Cottus rhenanus and Cottus perifretum. Hybrids have recently invaded
   large river habitats unsuitable to ancestral species. Through the use of
   genetic mapping, the authors established that contrary to expectations,
   chromosomal rearrangements were not apparent in the hybrid lineages. In
   addition, different population genetic models were tested and the
   results suggest that contemporary gene flow from ancestral species
   represents an important component of the system. As such, recent and
   ongoing hybridization appears to be promoting the appearance of
   phenotypes adapted to novel environments. The examination of partially
   isolated lineages such as invasive hybrid sculpins should permit to
   identify early adaptive genetic changes before they become confounded by
   differences arising once speciation is complete.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to the development of any conservation strategies to mitigate
   deleterious impacts of environmental change and contamination, there
   must be a method to make meaningful predictions of the effect of
   environmental change on organisms. Assessment of relative transcriptomic
   expression patterns can provide a link between the environment and the
   physiological response of the organism by identifying genes that respond
   to environmental stressors; this information could also assist in
   teasing apart the molecular basis of toxicological effects vs.
   physiological adaptation. Molecular responses to environmental stressors
   are probably not restricted to single or few genes, and therefore a more
   integrative approach is required to examine broad-scale patterns of
   transcriptomic response. To address this objective, <link
   rid={''}b2{''}>Chapman et al. (2011) used machine learning tools to link
   the mechanisms of physiological response to environmental stress;
   although widely used in clinical applications, such as finding the

   ecological genomics applications of artificial neural networks are just

Abstract = {{European eels (Anguilla anguilla) spawn in the remote Sargasso Sea in
   partial sympatry with American eels (Anguilla rostrata), and juveniles
   are transported more than 5000 km back to the European and North African
   coasts. The two species have been regarded as classic textbook examples
   of panmixia, each comprising a single, randomly mating population.
   However, several recent studies based on continental samples have found
   subtle, but significant, genetic differentiation, interpreted as
   geographical or temporal heterogeneity between samples. Moreover,
   European and American eels can hybridize, but hybrids have been observed
   almost exclusively in Iceland, suggesting hybridization in a specific
   region of the Sargasso Sea and subsequent nonrandom dispersal of larvae.
   Here, we report the first molecular population genetics study based on
   analysis of 21 microsatellite loci in larvae of both Atlantic eel
   species sampled directly in the spawning area, supplemented by analysis
   of European glass eel samples. Despite a clear East-West gradient in the
   overlapping distribution of the two species in the Sargasso Sea, we only
   observed a single putative hybrid, providing evidence against the
   hypothesis of a wide marine hybrid zone. Analyses of genetic
   differentiation, isolation by distance, isolation by time and assignment
   tests provided strong evidence for panmixia in both the Sargasso Sea and
   across all continental samples of European eel after accounting for the
   presence of sibs among newly hatched larvae. European eel has declined
   catastrophically, and our findings call for management of the species as
   a single unit, necessitating coordinated international conservation
   efforts.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1347-1363}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aside from its selective role in filtering inter-individual variation
   during evolution by natural selection, the environment also plays an
   instructive role in producing variation during development. External
   environmental cues can influence developmental rates and/or trajectories
   and lead to the production of distinct phenotypes from the same
   genotype. This can result in a better match between adult phenotype and
   selective environment and thus represents a potential solution to
   problems posed by environmental fluctuation. The phenomenon is called
   adaptive developmental plasticity. The study of developmental plasticity
   integrates different disciplines (notably ecology and developmental
   biology) and analyses at all levels of biological organization, from the
   molecular regulation of changes in organismal development to variation
   in phenotypes and fitness in natural populations. Here, we focus on
   recent advances and examples from morphological traits in animals to
   provide a broad overview covering (i) the evolution of developmental
   plasticity, as well as its relevance to adaptive evolution, (ii) the
   ecological significance of alternative environmentally induced
   phenotypes, and the way the external environment can affect development
   to produce them, (iii) the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental
   plasticity, with emphasis on the contribution of genetic, physiological
   and epigenetic factors, and (iv) current challenges and trends,
   including the relevance of the environmental sensitivity of development
   to studies in ecological developmental biology, biomedicine and
   conservation biology.}},

Title = {{Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences reveal recent divergence in
   morphologically indistinguishable petrels}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1364-1377}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Often during the process of divergence, genetic markers will only
   gradually obtain the signal of isolation. Studies of recently diverged
   taxa utilizing both mitochondrial and nuclear data sets may therefore
   yield gene trees with differing levels of phylogenetic signal as a
   result of differences in coalescence times. However, several factors can
   lead to this same pattern, and it is important to distinguish between
   them to gain a better understanding of the process of divergence and the
   factors driving it. Here, we employ three nuclear intron loci in
   addition to the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene to investigate the
   magnitude and timing of divergence between two endangered and nearly
   indistinguishable petrel taxa: the Galapagos (GAPE) and Hawaiian (HAPE)
   petrels (Pterodroma phaeopygia and P. sandwichensis). Phylogenetic
   analyses indicated reciprocal monophyly between these two taxa for the
   mitochondrial data set, but trees derived from the nuclear introns were
   unresolved. Coalescent analyses revealed effectively no migration
   between GAPE and HAPE over the last 100 000 generations and that they
   diverged relatively recently, approximately 550 000 years ago,
   coincident with a time of intense ecological change in both the
   Galapagos and Hawaiian archipelagoes. This indicates that recent
   divergence and incomplete lineage sorting are causing the difference in
   the strength of the phylogenetic signal of each data set, instead of
   insufficient variability or ongoing male-biased dispersal. Further
   coalescent analyses show that gene flow is low even between islands
   within each archipelago suggesting that divergence may be continuing at
   a local scale. Accurately identifying recently isolated taxa is becoming
   increasingly important as many clearly recognizable species are already
   threatened by extinction.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1378-1388}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The impact of natural selection on the adaptive divergence of invasive
   populations can be assessed by testing the null hypothesis that the
   extent of quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) would be similar
   to that of neutral molecular differentiation (F(ST)). Using eight
   microsatellite loci and a common garden approach, we compared Q(ST) and
   F(ST) among ten populations of an invasive species Ambrosia
   artemisiifolia (common ragweed) in France. In a common garden study with
   varying water and nutrient levels, we measured Q(ST) for five traits
   (height, total biomass, reproductive allocation, above- to belowground
   biomass ratio, and days to flowering). Although low F(ST) indicated weak
   genetic structure and strong gene flow among populations, we found
   significant diversifying selection (Q(ST) > F(ST)) for reproductive
   allocation that may be closely related to fitness. It suggests that
   abiotic conditions may have exerted selection pressure on A.
   artemisiifolia populations to differentiate adaptively, such that
   populations at higher altitude or latitude evolved greater reproductive
   allocation. As previous studies indicate multiple introductions from
   various source populations of A. artemisiifolia in North America, our
   results suggest that the admixture of introduced populations may have
   increased genetic diversity and additive genetic variance, and in turn,
   promoted the rapid evolution and adaptation of this invasive species.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Although New Zealand is a biodiversity hotspot, there has been little
   genetic investigation of why so many of its threatened and uncommon
   plants have naturally disjunct distributions. We investigated the small
   tree Pseudopanax ferox (Araliaceae), which has a widespread but highly
   disjunct lowland distribution within New Zealand. Genotyping of nuclear
   microsatellites and a chloroplast locus revealed pronounced genetic
   differentiation and four principal genetic clusters. Our results
   indicate that the disjunct distribution is a product of vicariance
   rather than long-distance dispersal. This highlights the need to
   preserve multiple populations when disjunct distributions are the result
   of vicariance, rather than focusing conservation efforts on a core area,
   in order to retain as much as possible of a species' evolutionary legacy
   and potential. Additionally, based on our genetic findings and the
   ecology of P. ferox, we hypothesize that it was more continuously
   distributed during the drier (but not maximally colder) interstadials of
   glacial periods and/or on the fertile soils available immediately
   postglacial. We further hypothesize that P. ferox belongs to a suite of
   species of drought-prone and/or fertile habitats whose distributions are
   actually restricted during warmer and wetter interglacial periods,
   despite being principally of the lowlands. Our genetic data for P. ferox
   are also the first consistent with the survival during the Last Glacial
   Maxima of a lowland tree at high latitudes in the south-eastern South
   Island.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variation arising from populations adapting to different
   niches has a complex underlying genetic architecture. A major challenge
   in modern biology is to identify the causative variants driving
   phenotypic variation. Recently, the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae has emerged as a powerful model for dissecting complex
   traits. However, past studies using a laboratory strain were unable to
   reveal the complete architecture of polygenic traits. Here, we present a
   linkage study using 576 recombinant strains obtained from crosses of
   isolates representative of the major lineages. The meiotic
   recombinational landscape appears largely conserved between populations;
   however, strain-specific hotspots were also detected. Quantitative
   measurements of growth in 23 distinct ecologically relevant environments
   show that our recombinant population recapitulates most of the standing
   phenotypic variation described in the species. Linkage analysis detected
   an average of 6.3 distinct QTLs for each condition tested in all
   crosses, explaining on average 39\% of the phenotypic variation. The
   QTLs detected are not constrained to a small number of loci, and the
   majority are specific to a single cross-combination and to a specific
   environment. Moreover, crosses between strains of similar phenotypes
   generate greater variation in the offspring, suggesting the presence of
   many antagonistic alleles and epistatic interactions. We found that
   subtelomeric regions play a key role in defining individual quantitative
   variation, emphasizing the importance of the adaptive nature of these
   regions in natural populations. This set of recombinant strains is a
   powerful tool for investigating the complex architecture of polygenic
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that the European corn borer, a major pest of
   maize crops, is actually composed of two genetically differentiated and
   reproductively isolated taxa, which are found in sympatry over a wide
   geographical range in Eurasia. Each taxon is adapted to specific host
   plants: Ostrinia nubilalis feeds mainly on maize, while O. scapulalis
   feeds mainly on hop or mugwort. Here, we present a genome scan approach
   as a first step towards an integrated molecular analysis of the adaptive
   genomic divergence between O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis. We analysed
   609 AFLP marker loci in replicate samples of sympatric populations of
   Ostrinia spp. collected on maize, hop and mugwort, in France. Using two
   genome scan methods based on the analysis of population differentiation,
   we found a set of 28 outlier loci that departed from the neutral
   expectation in one or the other method (of which a subset of 14 loci
   were common to both methods), which showed a significantly increased
   differentiation between O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis, when compared to
   the rest of the genome. A subset of 12 outlier loci were sequenced, of
   which 7 were successfully re-amplified as target candidate loci. Three
   of these showed homology with annotated lepidopteran sequences from
   public nucleotide databases.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to environmental
   conditions is a fundamental question for ecology and evolution. In this
   study, we evaluate changes in gene expression of a marine mollusc, the
   eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, associated with the
   physico-chemical conditions and the levels of metals and other
   contaminants in their environment. The results indicate that transcript
   signatures can effectively disentangle the complex interactive gene
   expression responses to the environment and are also capable of
   disentangling the complex dynamic effects of environmental factors on
   gene expression. In this context, the mapping of environment to gene and
   gene to environment is reciprocal and mutually reinforcing. In general,
   the response of transcripts to the environment is driven by major
   factors known to affect oyster physiology such as temperature, pH,
   salinity, and dissolved oxygen, with pollutant levels playing a
   relatively small role, at least within the range of concentrations found
   in the studied oyster habitats. Further, the two environmental factors
   that dominate these effects (temperature and pH) interact in a dynamic
   and nonlinear fashion to impact gene expression. Transcriptomic data
   obtained in our study provide insights into the mechanisms of
   physiological responses to temperature and pH in oysters that are
   consistent with the known effects of these factors on physiological
   functions of ectotherms and indicate important linkages between
   transcriptomics and physiological outcomes. Should these linkages hold
   in further studies and in other organisms, they may provide a novel
   integrated approach for assessing the impacts of climate change, ocean
   acidification and anthropogenic contaminants on aquatic organisms via
   relatively inexpensive microarray platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to adverse environmental conditions such as high altitude
   requires physiological and/or morphological changes. Genome scans
   provide a means to identify the genetic basis of such adaptations
   without previous knowledge about the particular genetic variants or
   traits under selection. In this study, we scanned 3027 amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) in four populations of the common
   vole Microtus arvalis for loci associated with local adaptation and high
   altitude. We investigated voles from two populations at high elevation
   (similar to 2000 m a.s.l.) representing the upper limit of the
   altitudinal distribution of the species and two geographically close
   low-altitude populations (< 600 m a.s.l.). Statistical analysis
   incorporated a new Bayesian F(ST) outlier approach specifically
   developed for AFLP markers, which considers the intensity of AFLP bands
   instead of mere presence/absence and allows to derive population-based
   estimates of allele frequencies and F(IS) values. Computer simulations
   showed that this approach increases the statistical power of the
   detection of AFLP markers under selection almost to the power of single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data without compromising specificity. Our
   enhanced genome scan resulted in 20 prime candidate markers for positive
   selection, which show mostly extremely high allele frequency differences
   between the low- and high-altitude populations. The comparison of
   global- and pairwise-enhanced genome scans demonstrated further that
   very strong selective signatures may also be associated with single
   populations suggesting the importance of local adaptation in alpine
   populations of common voles.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial plants monitor seasonal changes through changes in
   environmental conditions such as the quantity and quality of light and
   genes in the photoperiodic pathway are known to be involved in
   controlling these processes. Here, we examine 25 of genes from the
   photoperiod pathway in Populus tremula (Salicaceae) for signatures of
   adaptive evolution. Overall, levels of synonymous polymorphism in the 25
   genes are lower than at control loci selected randomly from the genome.
   This appears primarily to be caused by lower levels of synonymous
   polymorphism in genes associated with the circadian clock. Natural
   selection appears to play an important role in shaping protein evolution
   at several of the genes in the photoperiod pathways, which is
   highlighted by the fact that approximately 40\% of the genes from the
   photoperiod pathway have estimates of selection on nonsynonymous
   polymorphisms that are significantly different from zero. A surprising
   observation we make is that circadian clock-associated genes appear to
   be over-represented among the genes showing elevated rates of protein
   evolution; seven genes are evolving under positive selection and all but
   one of these genes are involved in the circadian clock of Populus.}},

Abstract = {{Homoploid hybridization after secondary contact between related species
   can lead to mixtures of genotypes which have the potential for rapid
   adaptation to new environmental conditions. Here, we focus on a case
   where anthropogenic changes within the past 200 years have allowed the
   hybridization between two fish species (Cottus rhenanus and Cottus
   perifretum) in the Netherlands. Specifically, we address the question of
   the dynamics of the emergence of these hybrids and invasion of the river
   systems. Using a set of 81 mostly ancestry-informative SNP markers, as
   well as broad sample coverage in and around the area of the initial
   contact, we find a structured hybrid swarm with at least three distinct
   hybrid lineages that have emerged out of this secondary contact
   situation. We show that genetically coherent groups can occur at
   geographically distant locations, while geographically adjacent groups
   can be genetically different, indicating that some form of reproductive
   isolation between the lineages is already effective. Using a newly
   developed modelling approach, we test the relative influence of founding
   admixture, drift and migration on the allele compositions of the
   sampling sites. We find that the allele frequency distributions can best
   be explained if continued gene flow between the parental species and the
   hybrid lineages is invoked. Genome mapping of the invasive lineage in
   the Rhine shows that major chromosomal rearrangements were not involved
   in creating this distinct lineage. Our results show that hybridization
   after secondary contact can quickly lead to multiple independent new
   lineages that have the capacity to form hybrid species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms responsible for divergence and
   specialization of pathogens on different hosts is of fundamental
   importance, especially in the context of the emergence of new diseases
   via host shifts. Temporal isolation has been reported in a few plants
   and parasites, but is probably one of the least studied speciation
   processes. We studied whether temporal isolation could be responsible
   for the maintenance of genetic differentiation among sympatric
   populations of Ampelomyces, widespread intracellular mycoparasites of
   powdery mildew fungi, themselves plant pathogens. The timing of
   transmission of Ampelomyces depends on the life cycles of the powdery
   mildew species they parasitize. Internal transcribed spacer sequences
   and microsatellite markers showed that Ampelomyces populations found in
   apple powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha) were genetically highly
   differentiated from other Ampelomyces populations sampled from several
   other powdery mildew species across Europe, infecting plant hosts other
   than apple. While P. leucotricha starts its life cycle early in spring,
   and the main apple powdery mildew epidemics occur before summer, the
   fungal hosts of the other Ampelomyces cause epidemics mainly in summer
   and autumn. When two powdery mildew species were experimentally exposed
   to Ampelomyces strains naturally occurring in P. leucotricha in spring,
   and to strains naturally present in other mycohost species in autumn,
   cross-infections always occurred. Thus, the host-related genetic
   differentiation in Ampelomyces cannot be explained by narrow
   physiological specialization, because Ampelomyces were able to infect
   powdery mildew species they were unlikely to have encountered in nature,
   but instead appears to result from temporal isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating complex parasitic life cycles is important for
   understanding the major fitness components that drive the evolution of
   host-parasite systems. The rare condition of heterotrophic heteronomy,
   in which the sexes utilize disparate host taxa, is a poorly understood
   complex parasitic lifestyle. One of only two known examples occurs in
   the Myrmecolacidae, an unusual family of the parasitoid order
   Strepsiptera (Insecta), in which males parasitize ants while females
   parasitize grasshoppers, crickets, and praying mantids. Here, we
   reconstruct the evolutionary pattern and timescale of host-use in a set
   of morphologically cryptic myrmecolacid taxa currently identified as
   Caenocholax fenyesi. We find that (i) C. fenyesi contains at least ten
   cryptic lineages consistent with separate species; (ii) Fossil evidence
   suggests a very low molecular clock rate and an ancient origin for
   cryptic lineages; (iii) Diversity among Caenocholax species is
   partitioned by geography and host association of the female; and (iv)
   Switches in host usage are uncoupled between the sexes, with changes in
   female host preference accompanying diversification. This study
   represents the first phylogeographical analysis of any strepsipteran,
   and the first molecular examination of host-use for a heterotrophic
   heteronomous taxon. Our results have implications for the understanding
   of evolution, host usage and estimated species richness in parasitic
   taxa.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1529-1545}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Refugia featured prominently in shaping evolutionary trajectories during
   repeated cycles of glaciation in the Quaternary, particularly in the
   Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere instead experienced cycles
   of severe aridification but little is known about the temporal presence
   and role of refugia for arid-adapted biota. Isolated mountain ranges
   located in the Australian arid zone likely provided refugia for many
   species following Mio/Pliocene (< 15 Ma) aridification; however, the
   evolutionary consequences of the recent development of widespread sand
   deserts is largely unknown. To test alternative hypotheses of ancient
   vs. recent isolation, we generated a 10 gene data set to assess
   divergence history among saxicolous geckos in the genus Heteronotia that
   have distributions confined to major rocky ranges in the arid zone.
   Phylogenetic analyses show that each rocky range harbours a divergent
   lineage, and substantial intraspecific diversity is likely due to
   topographic complexity in these areas. Old divergences (similar to 4 Ma)
   among lineages pre-date the formation of the geologically young sand
   deserts (< 1 Ma), suggesting that Pliocene climate shifts fractured the
   distributions of biota long before the spread of the deserts.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how heterozygosity at the major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) affects fitness in wild-derived (F2) house mice (Mus
   musculus musculus). To compare and control for potential confounding
   effects from close inbreeding and genome-wide heterozygosity, we used
   mice that were systematically outbred. We assessed how heterozygosity at
   MHC and background loci (using 15 microsatellite markers on 11 different
   chromosomes) affects individual survival and reproductive success (RS)
   in large, semi-natural population enclosures. We found that overall
   heterozygosity significantly increased RS, and this correlation was
   entirely explained by heterozygosity at two MHC loci. Moreover, we found
   that the effects of MHC heterozygosity depend on the level of background
   heterozygosity, and the benefits of maximal MHC heterozygosity show a
   curvilinear effect with increasing background heterozygosity. The
   enhanced RS from MHC heterozygosity was not because of increased
   survival, and although MHC heterozygosity was correlated with body mass,
   body mass did not correlate with RS when heterozygosity is controlled.
   Breeders were more MHC heterozygous than nonbreeders for both sexes,
   indicating that MHC heterozygosity enhanced fecundity, mating success or
   both. Our results show that (i) MHC heterozygosity enhances fitness
   among wild, outbred as well as congenic laboratory mice; (ii)
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations can potentially be explained by a
   few loci, such as MHC; (iii) MHC heterozygosity can increase fitness,
   even without affecting survival, by increasing mating and RS; and (iv)
   MHC effects depend on background genes, and maximal MHC heterozygosity
   is most beneficial at intermediate or optimal levels of background
   heterozygosity.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1558-1567}},

Abstract = {{Almost all studies of the immune system of animals with metamorphosis
   have focused on either larval or on adult immunity, implicitly assuming
   that these traits are either perfectly correlated or evolutionarily
   independent. In this study, we use 80 crosses among 21 Drosophila
   melanogaster lines to investigate the degree and constancy of genetic
   correlation in immune system activity between larvae and adults. The
   constitutive transcription of Diptericin, a gene encoding a defensive
   antimicrobial peptide, was controlled by the same genetic factors in
   larvae and adults, with variation in expression determined exclusively
   by nonadditive genetic effects. This contrasted with another
   peptide-encoding gene, Drosomycin, in which larval transcription was
   highly variable and determined by additive effects but adult
   transcription genetically invariant. We found no evidence for a fitness
   cost to the transcription of these genes in our study. The shared
   genetic control of larval and adult Diptericin transcription stands in
   contrast to predictions of the adaptive decoupling hypothesis, which
   states that distinct life-stages should permit the independent evolution
   of larval and adult phenotypes. Importantly, genetic correlations
   between larval and adult immunities imply that parasite pressure on one
   life-stage can drive the evolution of immunity (and resistance) in the
   other life-stage.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding precisely how plants disperse their seeds and pollen in
   their neighbourhood is a central question for both ecologists and
   evolutionary biologists because seed and pollen dispersal governs both
   the rate of spread of an expanding population and gene flow within and
   among populations. The concept of a `dispersal kernel' has become
   extremely popular in dispersal ecology as a tool that summarizes how
   dispersal distributes individuals and genes in space and at a given
   scale. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, the study by <link
   rid={''}b7{''}>Moran \& Clark (2011) (M\&C in the following) shows how
   genotypic and spatial data of established seedlings can be analysed in a
   Bayesian framework to estimate jointly the pollen and seed dispersal
   kernels and finally derive a parentage analysis from a full-probability
   approach. This approach applied to red oak shows important dispersal of
   seeds (138 m on average) and pollen (178 m on average). For seeds, this
   estimate contrasts with previous results from inverse modelling on seed
   trap data (9.3 m). This research gathers several methodological advances
   made in recent years in two research communities and could become a
   cornerstone for dispersal ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic differentiation among populations is affected by mutation as
   well as by migration, drift and selection. For loci with high mutation
   rates, such as microsatellites, the amount of mutation can influence the
   values of indices of differentiation such as G(ST) and F-ST. For many
   purposes, this effect is undesirable, and as a result, new indices such
   as <file type={''}gif{''} name={''}mec\_4996\_mu2.gif{''}/> and D have
   been proposed to measure population differentiation. This paper shows
   that these new indices are not effective measures of the causes or
   consequences of population structure. Both <file type={''}gif{''}
   name={''}mec\_4996\_mu3.gif{''}/> and D depend heavily on mutation rate,
   but both are insensitive to any population genetic process when the
   mutation rate is high relative to the migration rate. Furthermore, D is
   specific to the locus being measured, and so little can be inferred
   about the population demography from D. However, at equilibrium, D may
   provide an index of whether a particular marker is more strongly
   affected by mutation than by migration. I argue that F-ST is a more
   important summary of the effects of population structure than D and that
   R-ST or other measures that explicitly account for the mutation process
   are much better than G(ST), <file type={''}gif{''}
   name={''}mec\_4996\_mu4.gif{''}/>, or D for highly mutable markers.
   Markers with lower mutation rates will often be easier to interpret.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, the use of molecular markers has revolutionized
   biology and led to the foundation of a new research
   discipline-phylogeography. Of particular interest has been the inference
   of population structure and biogeography. While initial studies focused
   on mtDNA as a molecular marker, it has become apparent that selection
   and genealogical lineage sorting could lead to erroneous inferences. As
   it is not clear to what extent these forces affect a given marker, it
   has become common practice to use the combined evidence from a set of
   molecular markers as an attempt to recover the signals that approximate
   the true underlying demography. Typically, the number of markers used is
   determined by either budget constraints or by statistical power required
   to recognize significant population differentiation. Using
   microsatellite markers from Drosophila and humans, we show that even
   large numbers of loci (> 50) can frequently result in statistically
   well-supported, but incorrect inference of population structure using
   the software baps. Most importantly, genomic features, such as
   chromosomal location, variability of the markers, or recombination rate,
   cannot explain this observation. Instead, it can be attributed to
   sampling variation among loci with different realizations of the
   stochastic lineage sorting. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced
   for low levels of population differentiation. Our results have important
   implications for ongoing studies of population differentiation, as we
   unambiguously demonstrate that statistical significance of population
   structure inferred from a random set of genetic markers cannot
   necessarily be taken as evidence for a reliable demographic inference.}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous circadian rhythms are almost ubiquitous among organisms from
   cyanobacteria to mammals and regulate diverse physiological processes.
   It has been suggested that having an endogenous circadian system enables
   an organism to anticipate periodic environmental changes and adapt its
   physiological and developmental states accordingly, thus conferring a
   fitness advantage. However, it is hard to measure fitness directly and
   there is, to date, only limited evidence supporting the assumption that
   having a circadian system can increase fitness and therefore be
   adaptive. In this article, we report an evolutionary approach to examine
   the adaptive significance of a circadian system. By crossing Arabidopsis
   thaliana plants containing mutations that cause changes in circadian
   rhythms, we have created heterozygous `Mother' (F1) plants with genetic
   variance for circadian rhythmicity. The segregating F2 offspring present
   a range of circadian rhythm periods. We have applied a selection to the
   F2 plants of short and long T-cycles under different competition
   strengths and found that the average phenotype of circadian period of
   the resulting F3 plants show a strong positive correlation with the
   T-cycle growth conditions for the competing F2 plants. Consistent with
   their circadian phenotypes, the frequency of long-period alleles was
   altered in the F3 plants. Our results show that F2 plants with
   endogenous rhythms that more closely match the environmental T-cycle are
   fitter, producing relatively more viable offspring in the F3 population.
   Thus, having a circadian clock that matches with the environment is
   adaptive in Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{Although theoretical models predict that the structure of a hybrid zone
   can change under a variety of scenarios, only a few empirical studies of
   hybrid zones have unequivocally demonstrated zone movement. These
   studies are rare because few data sets exist that include repeated,
   temporally spaced, samples of the same hybrid zone. We analysed
   mitochondrial DNA haplotype data from samples separated by 40-45 years
   from across the Passerina amoena (Lazuli Bunting) and Passerina cyanea
   (Indigo Bunting) hybrid zone to investigate whether the genetic
   structure of this zone has changed during that interval. Both cline and
   generalized linear mixed modelling analyses uncovered a significant
   narrowing and a substantial westward shift of the Passerina bunting
   hybrid zone, clearly illustrating hybrid zone movement. The cause of the
   change may be due to a combination of ecological, demographic and
   behavioural factors. Our results predict that the width of the hybrid
   zone will continue to narrow over time, a finding consistent with
   reinforcement theory.}},

Abstract = {{The study of species complexes is of particular interest to understand
   how evolutionary young species maintain genomic integrity. The Daphnia
   pulex complex has been intensively studied as it includes species that
   dominate freshwater environments in the Northern hemisphere and as it is
   the sole North American complex that shows transitions to obligate
   parthenogenesis. Past studies using mitochondrial markers have revealed
   the presence of 10 distinct lineages in the complex. This study is the
   first to examine genetic relationships among seven species of the
   complex at nuclear markers (nine microsatellite loci and one
   protein-coding gene). Clones belonging to the seven species of the
   Daphnia pulex complex were characterized at the mitochondrial NADH
   dehydrogenase (ND5) gene and at the Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) locus.
   K-means, principal coordinate analyses and phylogenetic network analyses
   on the microsatellite data all separated European D. pulicaria, D.
   tenebrosa, North American D. pulex, D. pulicaria and their hybrids into
   distinct clusters. The hybrid cluster was composed of diploid and
   polyploid hybrids with D. pulex mitochondria and some clones with D.
   pulicaria mitochondria. By contrast, the phylogeny of the D. pulex
   complex using Rab4 was not well resolved but still showed clusters
   consisting mostly of D. pulex alleles and others of D. pulicaria
   alleles. Incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization may obscure
   genetic relationships at this locus. This study shows that hybridization
   and introgression have played an important role in the evolution of this
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{Lichens are symbioses between fungi (mycobionts) and photoautotrophic
   green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts). Many lichens occupy large
   distributional ranges covering several climatic zones. So far, little is
   known about the large-scale phylogeography of lichen photobionts and
   their role in shaping the distributional ranges of lichens. We studied
   south polar, temperate and north polar populations of the widely
   distributed fruticose lichen Cetraria aculeata. Based on the DNA
   sequences from three loci for each symbiont, we compared the genetic
   structure of mycobionts and photobionts. Phylogenetic reconstructions
   and Bayesian clustering methods divided the mycobiont and photobiont
   data sets into three groups. An amova shows that the genetic variance of
   the photobiont is best explained by differentiation between temperate
   and polar regions and that of the mycobiont by an interaction of
   climatic and geographical factors. By partialling out the relative
   contribution of climate, geography and codispersal, we found that the
   most relevant factors shaping the genetic structure of the photobiont
   are climate and a history of codispersal. Mycobionts in the temperate
   region are consistently associated with a specific photobiont lineage.
   We therefore conclude that a photobiont switch in the past enabled C.
   aculeata to colonize temperate as well as polar habitats. Rare
   photobiont switches may increase the geographical range and ecological
   niche of lichen mycobionts by associating them with locally adapted
   photobionts in climatically different regions and, together with
   isolation by distance, may lead to genetic isolation between populations
   and thus drive the evolution of lichens.}},

   ecological and demographic changes of alpine populations provided the
   opportunity for formation of neoendemic species. Several biogeographical
   models have been proposed to account for the unique history of alpine
   populations, with different expectations of genetic divergence and
   speciation. The expanding alpine archipelago model proposes that alpine
   populations expand spatially and demographically during glacial events,
   dispersing between mountain ranges. Under this model, alpine populations
   are unlikely to diverge in isolation due to substantial interpopulation
   gene flow. In contrast, the alpine archipelago refuge model proposes
   that gene flow during glacial phases is limited and populations expand
   demographically during interglacial phases, increasing genetic isolation
   and the likelihood of speciation. We assess these models by
   reconstructing the evolutionary history of Colias behrii, a
   morphologically and ecologically distinct alpine butterfly restricted to
   the California Sierra Nevada. C. behrii exhibits very low genetic
   diversity at mitochondrial and nuclear loci, limited population
   structure and evidence of population expansion. C. behrii and Rocky
   Mountain C. meadii share identical mitochondrial haplotypes, while in
   contrast, nuclear data indicate common ancestry between C. behrii and
   Cascades Range Colias pelidne. The conflict in gene genealogies may be a
   result of recent expansion in North American Colias, but an isolation
   with migration analysis indicates that genetic patterns in C. behrii
   might result from differential introgression following hybridization.
   Based on the timing of population expansion and gene flow between
   mountain ranges, the expanding alpine archipelago model is supported in
   C. behrii.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating rates of movement among populations is never simple, and
   where young animals cannot all be captured at their birth sites,
   traditional field methods potentially underestimate dispersal rates.
   Genetic assignment tests appear to hold promise for detecting
   `precapture' dispersal, and recent evidence suggests that even on the
   scale of dispersal between populations, genetic parentage analyses can
   also be informative. Herein, we examine the performance of both types of
   analysis with data from a 17-year study of dispersal in banner-tailed
   kangaroo rats Dipodomys spectabilis. We compare estimates of precapture
   dispersal from (i) the commonly used parentage analysis program cervus
   (ii) a pedigree-reconstruction program, MasterBayes, that combines
   genetic with spatial and other nongenetic information and (iii) genetic
   assignment procedures implemented by the program geneclass2, with (iv)
   rates of dispersal observed through recapture of a subset of animals
   initially marked shortly after weaning. geneclass2 estimates a larger
   proportion of precapture dispersers than MasterBayes, but both
   approaches as well as those based on field data alone, suggest that
   approximately 10\% of adults in local populations are immigrants and
   that interpopulation dispersal is slightly female-biassed. All genetic
   procedures detect precapture dispersal between populations, but
   dispersers identified by MasterBayes are particularly compatible with
   what is independently known about body mass at dispersal, dispersal
   distance and distance between parents. Parentage analyses have
   considerable potential to infer the value of this otherwise elusive
   demographic parameter when most candidate parents can be genotyped and
   when nongenetic information, especially the distance separating
   candidate mothers and fathers, can be incorporated into the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the spatial organization of root diversity in plant
   communities and of the mechanisms of community assembly has been limited
   by our ability to identify plants based on root tissue, especially in
   diverse communities. Here, we test the effectiveness of the plastid gene
   rbcL, a core plant DNA barcoding marker, for investigating spatial
   patterns of root diversity, and relate observed patterns to above-ground
   community structure. We collected 3800 root fragments from four randomly
   positioned, 1-m-deep soil profiles (two vertical transects per plot),
   located in an old-field community in southern Ontario, Canada, and
   extracted and sequenced DNA from 1531 subsampled fragments. We
   identified species by comparing sequences with a DNA barcode reference
   library developed previously for the local flora. Nearly 85\% of sampled
   root fragments were successfully sequenced and identified as belonging
   to 29 plant species or species groups. Root abundance and species
   richness varied in horizontal space and were negatively correlated with
   soil depth. The relative abundance of taxa below-ground was correlated
   with their frequency above-ground (r = 0.73, P = 0.0001), but several
   species detected in root tissue were not observed in above-ground
   quadrats. Multivariate analyses indicated that diversity was highly
   structured below-ground, and associated with depth, root morphology,
   soil chemistry and soil texture, whereas little structure was evident
   above-ground. Furthermore, analyses of species co-occurrence indicates
   strong species segregation overall but random co-occurrence among
   confamilials. Our results provide insights into the role of
   environmental filtering and competitive interactions in the organization
   of plant diversity below-ground, and also demonstrate the utility of
   barcoding for the identification of plant roots.}},

Abstract = {{Mycoheterotrophic species have abandoned an autotrophic lifestyle and
   obtain carbon exclusively from mycorrhizal fungi. Although these species
   have evolved independently in many plant families, such events have
   occurred most often in the Orchidaceae, resulting in the highest
   concentration of these species in the tracheophytes. Studies of
   mycoheterotrophic species' mycobionts have generally revealed extreme
   levels of mycorrhizal specialization, suggesting that this system is
   ideal for studying the evolution of mycorrhizal associations. However,
   these studies have often investigated single or few, often unrelated,
   species without consideration of their phylogenetic relationships.
   Herein, we present the first investigation of the mycorrhizal associates
   of all species of a well-characterized orchid genus comprised
   exclusively of mycoheterotrophic species. With the employment of
   molecular phylogenetic methods, we identify the fungal associates of
   each of nine Hexalectris species from 134 individuals and 42
   populations. We report that Hexalectris warnockii associates exclusively
   with members of the Thelephoraceae, H. brevicaulis and H. grandiflora
   associate with members of the Russulaceae and Sebacinaceae subgroup A,
   while each member of the H. spicata species complex associates primarily
   with unique sets of Sebacinaceae subgroup A clades. These results are
   consistent with other studies of mycorrhizal specificity within
   mycoheterotrophic plants in that they suggest strong selection within
   divergent lineages for unique associations with narrow clades of
   mycorrhizal fungi. Our results also suggest that mycorrhizal
   associations are a rapidly evolving characteristic in the H. spicata
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{The immune function of wild animals has been rather little studied. Wild
   animals' immune function may differ from that of laboratory bred animals
   because of their different environments. This idea follows from the
   concept of resource partitioning in which animals distribute scarce
   resources to all aspects of life, including to costly immune responses.
   A logical extension of this idea is that there may be substantial
   interindividual variation in the immune function of wild animals. To
   begin to investigate this, we compared the immune function of a
   laboratory bred mouse strain (C57BL/6, a widely used mouse strain that
   makes potent immune responses) and wild caught Mus musculus. We found
   that by most measures of immune function, the wild caught mice had
   greater immune function. Specifically, wild mice had greater
   concentrations and more avid antigen-specific IgG responses, as well as
   higher concentrations of total IgG and IgE, compared with those
   laboratory bred mice. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed a
   comparatively greater overall level of activation of the cells of the
   immune system in wild mice. Lastly, we observed that immune function was
   substantially more variable among wild caught mice than among the
   laboratory bred mice. The next research challenge is to understand which
   aspects of an individual animal's life determine its immune function.}},

Abstract = {{A revolutionary advance in ecological immunology is that postgenomic
   technologies now allow molecular mediators defined in laboratory models
   to be measured at the mRNA level in field studies of many naturally
   occurring species. Here, we demonstrate the application of such an
   approach to generate meaningful immunological profiles for wild mammals.
   We sampled a natural field vole population across the year (n = 307) and
   developed a battery of cellular assays in which functionally different
   pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling responses (transcription factors
   and cytokines) were activated and quantified by Q-PCR. Temporal trends
   were the strongest feature in the expression data, although some life
   history stages (mating vs. nonmating males and pregnant females) were
   also associated with significant variation. There was a striking set of
   significant negative associations between inflammatory mediators and
   condition indices reflecting packed erythrocyte volume and relative
   liver size, spleen size and splenocyte count. Grouped (principal
   component) measures of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression
   were high in winter, with minima in the breeding season that occurred
   earlier for grouped anti-inflammatory responses than for grouped
   inflammatory responses. Some individual immunological mediators also
   showed patterns unrelated to the breeding season or annual periodic
   cues. For example, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) expression
   declined throughout the study period, indicating a systematic trend in
   antimicrobial defences. Pinpointing the causes and consequences of such
   variation may help identify underlying environmental drivers of
   individual fitness and demographic fluctuation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis offers a route to gene discovery
   which by-passes the need to develop bespoke arrays for nonmodel species,
   and is therefore a potentially valuable tool for molecular ecologists.
   Scottish blackface sheep, which vary in resistance to the common
   abomasal parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta, were
   trickle-infected with L3 larvae over 3 months to mimic the natural
   progression of infection. DGE was performed on abomasal lymph node
   tissue after the resolution of infection in resistant animals.
   Susceptible (low resistance) animals showed a large number of
   differentially expressed genes associated with inflammation and cell
   activation, but generally few differentially regulated genes in either
   the susceptible or the resistant group were directly involved in the
   adaptive immune function. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that both resistance and susceptibility are active responses to
   infection and that susceptibility is associated with dysfunction in T
   cell differentiation and regulation.}},

Title = {{Transcriptomic response of red grouse to gastro-intestinal nematode
   parasites and testosterone: implications for population dynamics}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{920-931}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A central issue in ecology is in understanding the relative influences
   of intrinsic and extrinsic effects on population regulation. Previous
   studies on the cyclic population dynamics of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus
   scoticus) have emphasized the destabilizing effects of either nematode
   parasites or territorial behaviour and aggression. The potential
   interacting effects of these processes, mediated through
   density-dependent, environmentally induced alterations of host
   immunocompetence influencing susceptibility to parasites have not been
   considered. Male red grouse at high density are more aggressive,
   associated with increased testosterone, which potentially could lead to
   reduced immunocompetence at a stage when parasites are most prevalent.
   This could depress individual condition, breeding performance and
   survival and thus drive or contribute to overall reductions in
   population size. Here, we characterize the transcriptomic response of
   grouse to nematode parasite infection and investigate how this is
   subsequently affected by testosterone, using a microarray approach
   contrasting red grouse with high and low parasite load at both high and
   low testosterone titre. A suite of 52 transcripts showed a significant
   level of up-regulation to either chronic parasite load or experimental
   parasite infection. Of these, 51 (98\%) showed a reduced level of
   expression under conditions of high parasite load and high testosterone.
   The genes up-regulated by parasites and then down-regulated at high
   testosterone titre were not necessarily associated with immune response,
   as might be intuitively expected. The results are discussed in relation
   to the fitness and condition of individual red grouse and factors
   influencing the regulation of abundance in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Individual hosts normally respond to parasite attack by launching an
   acute immune response (a phenotypic plastic response), while host
   populations can respond in the longer term by evolving higher level of
   defence against parasites. Little is known about the genetics of the
   evolved response: the identity and number of genes involved and whether
   it involves a pre-activation of the regulatory systems governing the
   plastic response. We explored these questions by surveying
   transcriptional changes in a Drosophila melanogaster strain artificially
   selected for resistance against the hymenopteran endoparasitoid Asobara
   tabida. Using micro-arrays, we profiled gene expression at seven time
   points during development (from the egg to the second instar larva) and
   found a large number of genes (almost 900) with altered expression
   levels. Bioinformatic analysis showed that some were involved in
   immunity or defence-associated functions but many were not. Previously,
   we had defined a set of genes whose level of expression changed after
   parasitoid attack and a comparison with the present set showed a
   significant though comparatively small overlap. This suggests that the
   evolutionary response to parasitism is not a simple pre-activation of
   the plastic, acute response. We also found overlap in the genes involved
   in the evolutionary response to parasitism and to other biotic and
   abiotic stressors, perhaps suggesting a `module' of genes involved in a
   generalized stress response as has been found in other organisms.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As a result of an intense host-parasite evolutionary arms race,
   parasitic wasps frequently display high levels of specialization on very
   few host species. For instance, in braconid wasps very few generalist
   species have been described. However, within this family, Cotesia
   sesamiae is a generalist species that is widespread in sub-Saharan
   Africa and develops on several lepidopteran hosts. In this study, we
   tested the hypothesis that C. sesamiae may be a cryptic specialist when
   examined at the intraspecific level. We sequenced exon 2 of CrV1, a gene
   of the symbiotic polyDNAvirus that is integrated into the wasp genome
   and is associated with host immune suppression. We found that CrV1
   genotype was more closely associated with the host in which the
   parasitoid developed than any abiotic environmental factor tested. We
   also tested a correlation between CrV1 genotype and an infection with
   Wolbachia bacteria, which are known for their ability to induce
   reproductive isolation. The Wolbachia bacteria infection polymorphism
   was also found as a major factor explaining the genetic structure of
   CrV1, and, in addition, the best model explaining CrV1 genetic structure
   involved an interaction between Wolbachia infection and host species. We
   suggest that Wolbachia could act as an agent capable of maintaining
   advantageous alleles for host specialization in different populations of
   C. sesamiae. This mechanism could be applicable to other insect models
   because of the high prevalence of Wolbachia in insects.}},

Abstract = {{Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites is probably
   ubiquitous. However, very little is known of the genetic changes
   associated with parasite infectivity evolution during adaptation to a
   coevolving host. We followed the phenotypic and genetic changes in a
   lytic virus population (bacteriophage; phage 2) that coevolved with its
   bacterial host, Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. First, we show the rapid
   evolution of numerous unique phage infectivity phenotypes, and that both
   phage host range and bacterial resistance to individual phage increased
   over coevolutionary time. Second, each of the distinct phage phenotypes
   in our study had a unique genotype, and molecular evolution did not act
   uniformly across the phage genome during coevolution. In particular, we
   detected numerous substitutions on the tail fibre gene, which is
   involved in the first step of the host-parasite interaction: host
   adsorption. None of the observed mutations could be directly linked with
   infection against a particular host, suggesting that the phenotypic
   effects of infectivity mutations are probably epistatic. However, phage
   genotypes with the broadest host ranges had the largest number of
   nonsynonymous amino acid changes on genes implicated in infectivity
   evolution. An understanding of the molecular genetics of phage
   infectivity has helped to explain the complex phenotypic coevolutionary
   dynamics in this system.}},

Abstract = {{For a better understanding of the complex coevolutionary processes
   between hosts and parasites, accurate identification of the actors
   involved in the interaction is of fundamental importance. Blood
   parasites of the Order Haemosporidia, responsible for malaria, have
   become the focus of a broad range of studies in evolutionary biology.
   Interestingly, molecular-based studies on avian malaria have revealed
   much higher species diversity than previously inferred with morphology.
   Meanwhile, studies on bat haemosporidian have been largely neglected. In
   Europe, only one genus (Polychromophilus) and two species have been
   morphologically described. To evaluate the presence of potential cryptic
   species and parasite prevalence, we undertook a molecular
   characterization of Polychromophilus in temperate zone bats. We used a
   nested-PCR approach on the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene to detect the
   presence of parasites in 237 bats belonging to four different species
   and in the dipteran bat fly Nycteribia kolenatii, previously described
   as being the vector of Polychromophilus. Polychromophilus murinus was
   found in the four bat species and in the insect vector with prevalence
   ranging from 4\% for Myotis myotis to 51\% for M. daubentoni. By
   sequencing 682 bp, we then investigated the phylogenetic relationships
   of Polychromophilus to other published malarial lineages. Seven
   haplotypes were found, all very closely related, suggesting the presence
   of a single species in our samples. These haplotypes formed a
   well-defined clade together with Haemosporidia of tropical bats,
   revealing a worldwide distribution of this parasite mostly neglected by
   malarial studies since the 1980s.}},

Abstract = {{In wild populations, individuals are regularly exposed to a wide range
   of pathogens. In this context, organisms must elicit and regulate
   effective immune responses to protect their health while avoiding
   immunopathology. However, most of our knowledge about the function and
   dynamics of immune responses comes from laboratory studies performed on
   inbred mice in highly controlled environments with limited exposure to
   infection. Natural populations, on the other hand, exhibit wide genetic
   and environmental diversity. We argue that now is the time for
   immunology to be taken into the wild. The goal of `wild immunology' is
   to link immune phenotype with host fitness in natural environments. To
   achieve this requires relevant measures of immune responsiveness that
   are both applicable to the host-parasite interaction under study and
   robustly associated with measures of host and parasite fitness. Bringing
   immunology to nonmodel organisms and linking that knowledge host
   fitness, and ultimately population dynamics, will face difficult
   challenges, both technical (lack of reagents and annotated genomes) and
   statistical (variation among individuals and populations). However, the
   affordability of new genomic technologies will help immunologists,
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists work together to translate and
   test our current knowledge of immune mechanisms in natural systems. From
   this approach, ecologists will gain new insight into mechanisms relevant
   to host health and fitness, while immunologists will be given a measure
   of the real-world health impacts of the immune factors they study. Thus,
   wild immunology can be the missing link between laboratory-based
   immunology and human, wildlife and domesticated animal health.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally inherited endosymbionts are found in numerous insect species
   and have various effects on host ecology. New symbioses are most
   commonly established following lateral transfer of an existing symbiont
   from one host species to another. Laboratory study has demonstrated that
   symbionts commonly perform poorly in novel hosts, with weak vertical
   transmission and maladaptive pathogenicity being observed in the
   generations following transfer. This poor performance probably limits
   symbiont occurrence. We here use microarray technology to test whether
   poor symbiont performance observed following 1 year of vertical
   transmission through a new host is associated with alteration in host
   gene expression or whether it occurs independently of this. We utilize
   the Drosophila melanogaster-Spiroplasma interaction and test the
   response of the host in the presence of both natural Spiroplasma
   infections and novel Spiroplasma infections transinfected previously
   from other host species. None of the Spiroplasma infections investigated
   produced upregulation in host haemolymph/fat body-based immune
   responses, and we therefore rejected the hypothesis that failure to
   thrive was associated with immune upregulation. One infection was
   associated with a downregulation of genes associated with egg production
   compared to uninfected controls, indicative of damage to the host. The
   Spiroplasma infection showed that the weakest vertical transmission
   showed no significant disturbance to host gene expression compared to
   uninfected controls. We conclude that the failure of Spiroplasma in
   novel host species is associated either with causing harm to their new
   hosts or through a failure to thrive in the new host that occurs
   independently of host responses to infection.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental infections of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) with
   genomically characterized plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae
   have facilitated the dissection of canonical eukaryotic defence pathways
   and parasite virulence factors. Plants are also attacked by herbivorous
   insects, and the development of an ecologically relevant genetic model
   herbivore that feeds on Arabidopsis will enable the parallel dissection
   of host defence and reciprocal resistance pathways such as those
   involved in xenobiotic metabolism. An ideal candidate is Scaptomyza
   flava, a drosophilid fly whose leafmining larvae are true herbivores
   that can be found in nature feeding on Arabidopsis and other crucifers.
   Here, we describe the life cycle of S. flava on Arabidopsis and use
   multiple approaches to characterize the response of Arabidopsis to S.
   flava attack. Oviposition choice tests and growth performance assays on
   different Arabidopsis ecotypes, defence-related mutants, and hormone and
   chitin-treated plants revealed significant differences in host
   preference and variation in larval performance across Arabidopsis
   accessions. The jasmonate and glucosinolate pathways in Arabidopsis are
   important in mediating quantitative resistance against S. flava, and
   priming with jasmonate or chitin resulted in increased resistance.
   Expression of xenobiotic detoxification genes was reduced in S. flava
   larvae reared on Arabidopsis jasmonate signalling mutants and increased
   in plants pretreated with chitin. These results and future research
   directions are discussed in the context of developing a genetic model
   system to analyse insect-plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The movement and transmission of avian influenza viral strains via wild
   migratory birds may vary by host species as a result of migratory
   tendency and sympatry with other infected individuals. To examine the
   roles of host migratory tendency and species sympatry on the movement of
   Eurasian low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) genes into North America,
   we characterized migratory patterns and LPAI viral genomic variation in
   mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of Alaska in comparison with LPAI
   diversity of northern pintails (Anas acuta). A 50-year band-recovery
   data set suggests that unlike northern pintails, mallards rarely make
   trans-hemispheric migrations between Alaska and Eurasia. Concordantly,
   fewer (14.5\%) of 62 LPAI isolates from mallards contained Eurasian gene
   segments compared to those from 97 northern pintails (35\%), a species
   with greater inter-continental migratory tendency. Aerial survey and
   banding data suggest that mallards and northern pintails are largely
   sympatric throughout Alaska during the breeding season, promoting
   opportunities for interspecific transmission. Comparisons of full-genome
   isolates confirmed near-complete genetic homology (> 99.5\%) of seven
   viruses between mallards and northern pintails. This study found viral
   segments of Eurasian lineage at a higher frequency in mallards than
   previous studies, suggesting transmission from other avian species
   migrating inter-hemispherically or the common occurrence of endemic
   Alaskan viruses containing segments of Eurasian origin. We conclude that
   mallards are unlikely to transfer Asian-origin viruses directly to North
   America via Alaska but that they are likely infected with Asian-origin
   viruses via interspecific transfer from species with regular migrations
   to the Eastern Hemisphere.}},

Abstract = {{The black rat (Rattus rattus) is the main reservoir of plague (Yersinia
   pestis infection) in Madagascar's rural zones. Black rats are highly
   resistant to plague within the plague focus (central highland), whereas
   they are susceptible where the disease is absent (low altitude zone). To
   better understand plague wildlife circulation and host evolution in
   response to a highly virulent pathogen, we attempted to determine
   genetic markers associated with plague resistance in this species. To
   this purpose, we combined a population genomics approach and an
   association study, both performed on 249 AFLP markers, in Malagasy R.
   rattus. Simulated distributions of genetic differentiation were compared
   to observed data in four independent pairs, each consisting of one
   population from the plague focus and one from the plague-free zone. We
   found 22 loci (9\% of 249) with higher differentiation in at least two
   independent population pairs or with combining P-values over the four
   pairs significant. Among the 22 outlier loci, 16 presented significant
   association with plague zone (plague focus vs. plague-free zone).
   Population genetic structure inferred from outlier loci was structured
   by plague zone, whereas the neutral loci dataset revealed structure by
   geography (eastern vs. western populations). A phenotype association
   study revealed that two of the 22 loci were significantly associated
   with differentiation between dying and surviving rats following
   experimental plague challenge. The 22 outlier loci identified in this
   study may undergo plague selective pressure either directly or more
   probably indirectly due to hitchhiking with selected loci.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria parasites use vertebrate hosts for asexual multiplication and
   Culicidae mosquitoes for sexual and asexual development, yet the
   literature on avian malaria remains biased towards examining the asexual
   stages of the life cycle in birds. To fully understand parasite
   evolution and mechanism of malaria transmission, knowledge of all three
   components of the vector-host-parasite system is essential. Little is
   known about avian parasite-vector associations in African rainforests
   where numerous species of birds are infected with avian haemosporidians
   of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Here we applied high
   resolution melt qPCR-based techniques and nested PCR to examine the
   occurrence and diversity of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences of
   haemosporidian parasites in wild-caught mosquitoes sampled across 12
   sites in Cameroon. In all, 3134 mosquitoes representing 27 species were
   screened. Mosquitoes belonging to four genera (Aedes, Coquillettidia,
   Culex and Mansonia) were infected with twenty-two parasite lineages (18
   Plasmodium spp. and 4 Haemoproteus spp.). Presence of Plasmodium
   sporozoites in salivary glands of Coquillettidia aurites further
   established these mosquitoes as likely vectors. Occurrence of parasite
   lineages differed significantly among genera, as well as their
   probability of being infected with malaria across species and sites.
   Approximately one-third of these lineages were previously detected in
   other avian host species from the region, indicating that vertebrate
   host sharing is a common feature and that avian Plasmodium spp. vector
   breadth does not always accompany vertebrate-host breadth. This study
   suggests extensive invertebrate host shifts in mosquito-parasite
   interactions and that avian Plasmodium species are most likely not
   tightly coevolved with vector species.}},

Abstract = {{Avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) and other blood parasitic infections of
   birds constitute increasingly popular model systems in ecological and
   evolutionary host-parasite studies. Field studies of these parasites
   commonly use two traits in hypothesis testing: infection status (or
   prevalence at the population level) and parasitaemia, yet the causes of
   variation in these traits remain poorly understood. Here, we use
   quantitative PCR to investigate fine-scale environmental and host
   predictors of malaria infection status and parasitaemia in a large
   4-year data set from a well-characterized population of blue tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus). We also examine the temporal dynamics of both
   traits within individuals. Both infection status and parasitaemia showed
   marked temporal and spatial variation within this population. However,
   spatiotemporal patterns of prevalence and parasitaemia were
   non-parallel, suggesting that different biological processes underpin
   variation in these two traits at this scale. Infection probability and
   parasitaemia both increased with host age, and parasitaemia was higher
   in individuals investing more in reproduction (those with larger clutch
   sizes). Several local environmental characteristics predicted
   parasitaemia, including food availability, altitude, and distance from
   the woodland edge. Although infection status and parasitaemia were
   somewhat repeatable within individuals, infections were clearly dynamic:
   patent infections frequently disappeared from the bloodstream, with up
   to 26\% being lost between years, and parasitaemia also fluctuated
   within individuals across years in a pattern that mirrored annual
   population-level changes. Overall, these findings highlight the
   ecological complexity of avian malaria infections in natural
   populations, while providing valuable insight into the fundamental
   biology of this system that will increase its utility as a model
   host-parasite system.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how landscape features influence gene flow of black
   bears by testing the relative support for 36 alternative landscape
   resistance hypotheses, including isolation by distance (IBD) in each of
   12 study areas in the north central U.S. Rocky Mountains. The study
   areas all contained the same basic elements, but differed in extent of
   forest fragmentation, altitude, variation in elevation and road
   coverage. In all but one of the study areas, isolation by landscape
   resistance was more supported than IBD suggesting gene flow is likely
   influenced by elevation, forest cover, and roads. However, the landscape
   features influencing gene flow varied among study areas. Using subsets
   of loci usually gave models with the very similar landscape features
   influencing gene flow as with all loci, suggesting the landscape
   features influencing gene flow were correctly identified. To test if the
   cause of the variability of supported landscape features in study areas
   resulted from landscape differences among study areas, we conducted a
   limiting factor analysis. We found that features were supported in
   landscape models only when the features were highly variable. This is
   perhaps not surprising but suggests an important cautionary note - that
   if landscape features are not found to influence gene flow, researchers
   should not automatically conclude that the features are unimportant to
   the species' movement and gene flow. Failure to investigate multiple
   study areas that have a range of variability in landscape features could
   cause misleading inferences about which landscape features generally
   limit gene flow. This could lead to potentially erroneous identification
   of corridors and barriers if models are transferred between areas with
   different landscape characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding population history and genetic structure are key drivers
   of ecological research. Here, we studied two highly fragmented and
   isolated populations (Xiaoxiangling and Daxiangling) of giant pandas
   (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) at the extreme southwestern edge of their
   distribution. This area also contains the Dadu River, national road 108
   and various human infrastructure and development, providing an ideal
   region in which we can identify the effects of different barriers on
   animal movements. We used partial mitochondrial control region (mtDNA)
   and nine microsatellite loci (nuclear DNA) data derived from 192 faecal
   and one blood sample collected from the wild. We found 136 genotypes
   corresponding to 53 unique multilocus genotypes and eight unique control
   region haplotypes (653 bp). Significant genetic boundaries correlated
   spatially with the Dadu River (K = 2). We estimate that a major
   divergence took place between these populations 26 000 years bp, at
   around the similar time the rock surface of valley bottom formed in Dadu
   River. The national road has resulted in further recent population
   differentiation (Pairwise F(S) on mtDNA and nuclear DNA) so that in
   effect, four smaller sub-populations now exist. Promisingly, we
   identified two possible first-generation migrants and their migration
   paths, and recommended the immediate construction of a number of
   corridors. Fortunately, the Chinese government has accepted our advice
   and is now planning corridor construction.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced species offer unique opportunities to study evolution in new
   environments, and some provide opportunities for understanding the
   mechanisms underlying macroecological patterns. We sought to determine
   how introduction history impacted genetic diversity and differentiation
   of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), one of the most broadly
   distributed bird species. We screened eight microsatellite loci in 316
   individuals from 16 locations in the native and introduced ranges.
   Significant population structure occurred between native than introduced
   house sparrows. Introduced house sparrows were distinguished into one
   North American group and a highly differentiated Kenyan group. Genetic
   differentiation estimates identified a high magnitude of differentiation
   between Kenya and all other populations, but demonstrated that European
   and North American samples were differentiated too. Our results support
   previous claims that introduced North American populations likely had
   few source populations, and indicate house sparrows established
   populations after introduction. Genetic diversity also differed among
   native, introduced North American, and Kenyan populations with Kenyan
   birds being least diverse. In some cases, house sparrow populations
   appeared to maintain or recover genetic diversity relatively rapidly
   after range expansion (< 50 years; Mexico and Panama), but in others
   (Kenya) the effect of introduction persisted over the same period. In
   both native and introduced populations, genetic diversity exhibited
   large-scale geographic patterns, increasing towards the equator. Such
   patterns of genetic diversity are concordant with two previously
   described models of genetic diversity, the latitudinal model and the
   species diversity model.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological functional genomics, dealing with the responses of organisms
   to their natural environment is confronted with a complex pattern of
   variation and a large number of confounding environmental factors. For
   gene expression studies to provide meaningful information on conditions
   deviating from normal, a baseline or normal operating range (NOR)
   response needs to be established which indicates how an organism's
   transcriptome reacts to naturally varying ecological factors. Here we
   determine the transcriptional plasticity of a soil arthropod, Folsomia
   candida, exposed to various natural environments, as part of a first
   attempt in establishing such a NOR. Animals were exposed to 26 different
   field soils after which gene expression levels were measured. The main
   factor found to regulate gene expression was soil-type (sand or clay).
   Cell homeostasis and DNA replication were affected in collembolans
   exposed to sandy soil, indicating general stress. Multivariate analysis
   identified soil fertility as the main factor influencing gene
   expression. Regarding land-use, only forest soils showed an expression
   pattern deviating from the others. No significant effect of land-use,
   agricultural practice or soil type on fitness was observed, but arsenic
   concentration was negatively correlated with reproductive output. In
   conclusion, transcriptional responses remained within a limited range
   across the different land-uses but were significantly affected by
   soil-type. This may be caused by the contrasting soil physicochemical
   properties to which F. candida strongly responds. The broad range of
   conditions over which this soil-living detritivore is able to survive
   and reproduce, indicates a strategy of high plasticity, which comes with
   extensive gene expression regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Human-mediated global change will probably increase the rates of natural
   hybridization and genetic introgression between closely related species,
   and this will have major implications for conservation of the taxa
   involved. In this study, we analyse both mitochondrial and nuclear data
   to characterize ongoing hybridization and genetic introgression between
   two sympatric sister species of mustelids, the endangered European mink
   (Mustela lutreola) and the more abundant polecat (M. putorius). A total
   of 317 European mink, 114 polecats and 15 putative hybrid individuals
   were collected from different localities in Europe and genotyped with 13
   microsatellite nuclear markers. Recently developed Bayesian methods for
   assigning individuals to populations and identifying admixture
   proportions were applied to the genetic data. To identify the direction
   of hybridization, we additionally sequenced mtDNA and Y chromosomes from
   78 individuals and 29 males respectively. We found that both
   hybridization and genetic introgression occurred at low levels (3\% and
   0.9\% respectively) and indicated that hybridization is asymmetric, as
   only pure polecat males mate with pure European mink females.
   Furthermore, backcrossing and genetic introgression was detected only
   from female first-generation (F1) hybrids of European mink to polecats.
   This latter result implies that Haldane's rule may apply. Our results
   suggest that hybridization and genetic introgression between the two
   species should be considered a rather uncommon event. However, the
   current low densities of European mink might be changing this trend.}},

Abstract = {{The scale of seed and pollen movement in plants has a critical influence
   on population dynamics and interspecific interactions, as well as on
   their capacity to respond to environmental change through migration or
   local adaptation. However, dispersal can be challenging to quantify.
   Here, we present a Bayesian model that integrates genetic and ecological
   data to simultaneously estimate effective seed and pollen dispersal
   parameters and the parentage of sampled seedlings. This model is the
   first developed for monoecious plants that accounts for genotyping error
   and treats dispersal from within and beyond a plot in a fully consistent
   manner. The flexible Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of a
   variety of ecological variables, including individual variation in seed
   production, as well as multiple sources of uncertainty. We illustrate
   the method using data from a mixed population of red oak (Quercus rubra,
   Q. velutina, Q. falcata) in the NC piedmont. For simulated test data
   sets, the model successfully recovered the simulated dispersal
   parameters and pedigrees. Pollen dispersal in the example population was
   extensive, with an average father-mother distance of 178 m. Estimated
   seed dispersal distances at the piedmont site were substantially longer
   than previous estimates based on seed-trap data (average 128 m vs. 9.3
   m), suggesting that, under some circumstances, oaks may be less
   dispersal-limited than is commonly thought, with a greater potential for
   range shifts in response to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase the size of declining salmonid populations,
   supplementation programmes intentionally release fish raised in
   hatcheries into the wild. Because hatchery-born fish often have lower
   fitness than wild-born fish, estimating rates of gene flow from
   hatcheries into wild populations is essential for predicting the fitness
   cost to wild populations. Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have
   both freshwater resident and anadromous (ocean-going) life history
   forms, known as rainbow trout and steelhead, respectively. Juvenile
   hatchery steelhead that `residualize' (become residents rather than go
   to sea as intended) provide a previously unmeasured route for gene flow
   from hatchery into wild populations. We apply a combination of parentage
   and grandparentage methods to a three-generation pedigree of steelhead
   from the Hood River, Oregon, to identify the missing parents of
   anadromous fish. For fish with only one anadromous parent, 83\% were
   identified as having a resident father while 17\% were identified as
   having a resident mother. Additionally, we documented that resident
   hatchery males produced more offspring with wild anadromous females than
   with hatchery anadromous females. One explanation is the high fitness
   cost associated with matings between two hatchery fish. After accounting
   for all of the possible matings involving steelhead, we find that only
   1\% of steelhead genes come from residualized hatchery fish, while 20\%
   of steelhead genes come from wild residents. A further 23\% of
   anadromous steelhead genes come from matings between two resident
   parents. If these matings mirror the proportion of matings between
   residualized hatchery fish and anadromous partners, then closer to 40\%
   of all steelhead genes come from wild trout each generation. These
   results suggest that wild resident fish contribute substantially to
   endangered steelhead `populations' and highlight the need for
   conservation and management efforts to fully account for interconnected
   Oncorhynchus mykiss life histories.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity affects demography and gene dynamics in
   fragmented populations. Besides species-specific dispersal ability, the
   connectivity between local populations is affected by the landscape
   elements encountered during dispersal. Documenting these effects is thus
   a central issue for the conservation and management of fragmented
   populations. In this study, we compare the power and accuracy of three
   methods (partial correlations, regressions and Approximate Bayesian
   Computations) that use genetic distances to infer the effect of
   landscape upon dispersal. We use stochastic individual-based simulations
   of fragmented populations surrounded by landscape elements that differ
   in their permeability to dispersal. The power and accuracy of all three
   methods are good when there is a strong contrast between the
   permeability of different landscape elements. The power and accuracy can
   be further improved by restricting analyses to adjacent pairs of
   populations. Landscape elements that strongly impede dispersal are the
   easiest to identify. However, power and accuracy decrease drastically
   when landscape complexity increases and the contrast between the
   permeability of landscape elements decreases. We provide guidelines for
   future studies and underline the needs to evaluate or develop approaches
   that are more powerful.}},

Abstract = {{Associations with symbiotic microorganisms are a major source for
   evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes. Arthropods have long served as
   model systems to study such associations, especially since Paul
   Buchner's (1965) seminal work that beautifully illustrated the enormous
   diversity of microorganisms associated with insects. Particularly high
   taxonomic and functional diversities of microbial symbionts have been
   found in the guts and gut-associated organs of insects. These
   microorganisms play important roles in the digestion, nutrition and
   defence of the host. However, most studies of gut microorganisms have
   focused on single host taxa, limiting the ability to draw general
   conclusions on composition and functional roles of the insect gut
   microbiota. This is especially true for the diverse and important insect
   order Hymenoptera that comprises the bees, wasps and ants. Recently,
   Russell et al. (2009) analysed the bacterial community associated with
   diverse ant species and found evidence for changes in the microbial gut
   community coinciding with the evolution of herbivory. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Martinson et al. (2011) provide the first broad-scale
   bacterial survey for bees. Their findings substantiate earlier evidence
   for a surprisingly simple gut microbiota in honeybees (Apis mellifera)
   that is composed of only six to ten major phylotypes. Importantly,
   Martinson et al. demonstrate for the first time that the same bacterial
   phylotypes are major constituents of other Apis as well as Bombus
   species, but not of any other bees and wasps outside of the corbiculate
   bees, a clade of four tribes within the subfamily Apinae. These results
   indicate that corbiculate bees harbour a specific and possibly
   co-evolved bacterial community in their digestive tract. Furthermore,
   the comparison with other bees and wasps suggests that changes in social
   lifestyle may have had a stronger effect on the evolution of the gut
   microbiota than the dietary shift from predatory ancestors to
   pollen-feeding (i.e. herbivorous) species. These findings have
   far-reaching implications for research on the microbial symbionts of
   insects as well as on the nutritional physiology of the ecologically and
   economically important group of corbiculate bees.}},

Title = {{Interpopulation patterns of divergence and selection across the

Abstract = {{The accumulation of genetic incompatibilities between isolated
   populations is thought to lead to the evolution of intrinsic postzygotic
   isolation. The molecular basis for these mechanisms, however, remains
   poorly understood. The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus
   provides unique opportunities for addressing mechanistic questions
   regarding the early stages of speciation; hybrids between highly
   divergent populations are fertile and viable, but exhibit reduced
   fitness at the F-2 or later generations. Given the current scarcity of
   genomic information in taxa at incipient stages of reproductive
   isolation, we utilize high-throughout 454 pyrosequencing to characterize
   a substantial fraction of protein-coding regions (the transcriptome) of
   T. californicus. Our sequencing effort was divided equally between two
   divergent populations in order to estimate levels of divergence and to
   reveal patterns of selection across the transcriptome. Assembly of
   sequences generated over 40 000 putatively unique transcripts (unigenes)
   for each population, 19 622 of which were orthologous between
   populations. BLAST searches of public databases determined protein
   identity and functional features for 15 402 and 12 670 unigenes,
   respectively. Based on rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous
   substitutions in 5897 interpopulation orthologs (those > 150 bp and with
   at least 2X coverage), we identified 229 potential targets of positive
   selection. Many of these genes are predicted to be involved in several
   metabolic processes, and to function in hydrolase, peptidase and binding
   activities. The library of T. californicus coding regions, annotated
   with their predicted functions and level of divergence, will serve as an
   invaluable resource for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying the
   early stages of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular approaches that target the total DNA pool recovered from
   permanently anoxic marine ecosystems have revealed an extraordinary
   diversity of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. However, the
   presence of gene sequences contained within the extracellular DNA pool
   is still largely neglected. We have investigated the preservation,
   origin and genetic imprint of extracellular DNA recovered from
   permanently anoxic deep-sea sediments of the Black Sea. Despite high
   DNase activities, huge amounts of total extracellular DNA were found in
   both the surface and subsurface sediment layers, suggesting reduced
   availability of the extracellular DNA pool to nuclease degradation. The
   reduced degradation of the total extracellular DNA was confirmed by its
   low decay rate and the high accumulation in the deeper sediment layers.
   The copy numbers of 16S and 18S rDNA contained within the extracellular
   DNA pool in both the surface and subsurface sediment layers was very
   high, indicating that permanently anoxic sediments of the deep Black Sea
   are hot spots of preserved extracellular gene sequences. The
   extracellular DNA recovered from these sediment layers also contained
   highly diversified 18S rDNA sequences. These were not only
   representative of the major protistan lineages, but also of new very
   divergent lineages, branching as independent clades at the base of the
   tree. Our findings indicate that the extracellular DNA pool is a major
   archive of present/past eukaryotic gene sequences, and they highlight
   the importance of integrating molecular cell-oriented approaches with
   molecular analyses of the extracellular DNA pool, for a better
   assessment of microbial diversity and temporal changes in marine benthic
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Natural populations hold enormous potential for evolutionary genetic
   studies, especially when phenotypic, genetic and environmental data are
   all available on the same individuals. However, untangling the
   genotype-phenotype relationship in natural populations remains a major
   challenge. Here, we describe results of an investigation of one class of
   phenotype, allele-specific gene expression (ASGE), in the well-studied
   natural population of baboons of the Amboseli basin, Kenya. ASGE
   measurements identify cases in which one allele of a gene is
   overexpressed relative to the alternative allele of the same gene,
   within individuals, thus providing a control for background genetic and
   environmental effects. Here, we characterize the incidence of ASGE in
   the Amboseli baboon population, focusing on the genetic and
   environmental contributions to ASGE in a set of eleven genes involved in
   immunity and defence. Within this set, we identify evidence for common
   ASGE in four genes. We also present examples of two relationships
   between cis-regulatory genetic variants and the ASGE phenotype. Finally,
   we identify one case in which this relationship is influenced by a novel
   gene-environment interaction. Specifically, the dominance rank of an
   individual's mother during its early life (an aspect of that
   individual's social environment) influences the expression of the gene
   CCL5 via an interaction with cis-regulatory genetic variation. These
   results illustrate how environmental and ecological data can be
   integrated into evolutionary genetic studies of functional variation in
   natural populations. They also highlight the potential importance of
   early life environmental variation in shaping the genetic architecture
   of complex traits in wild mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous investigation found elevated nitrogen deposition caused
   declines in abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated
   with forest trees, but little is known about how nitrogen affects the
   AMF community composition and structure within forest ecosystems. We
   hypothesized that N deposition would lead to significant changes in the
   AMF community structure. We studied the diversity and community
   structure of AMF in northern hardwood forests after more than 12 years
   of simulated nitrogen deposition. We performed molecular analyses on
   maple (Acer spp.) roots targeting the 18S rDNA region using the
   fungal-specific primers AM1 and NS31. PCR products were cloned and
   identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and
   sequencing. N addition significantly altered the AMF community
   structure, and Glomus group A dominated the AMF community. Some Glomus
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) responded negatively to N inputs,
   whereas other Glomus OTUs and an Acaulospora OTU responded positively to
   N inputs. The observed effect on community structure implies that AMF
   species associated with maples differ in their response to elevated
   nitrogen. Given that functional diversity exists among AMF species and
   that N deposition has been shown to select less beneficial fungi in some
   ecosystems, this change in community structure could have implications
   for the functioning of this type of ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects are ubiquitously associated with multiple endosymbionts,
   whose infection patterns often exhibit spatial and temporal variations.
   How such endosymbiont variations are relevant to local adaptation of the
   host organisms is of ecological interest. Here, we report a
   comprehensive survey of endosymbionts in natural populations of the
   chestnut weevil Curculio sikkimensis, whose larvae are notorious pests
   of cultivated chestnuts and also infest acorns of various wild oaks.
   From 968 insects representing 55 localities across the Japanese
   Archipelago and originating from 10 host plant species, we identified
   six distinct endosymbiont lineages, namely Curculioniphilus, Sodalis,
   Serratia, Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Spiroplasma, at different infection
   frequencies (96.7\%, 12.8\%, 82.3\%, 82.5\%, 28.2\% and 6.8\%,
   respectively) and with different geographical distribution patterns.
   Multiple endosymbiont infections were very common; 3.18 +/- 0.61
   (ranging from 1.74 to 5.50) endosymbionts per insect on average in each
   of the local populations. Five pairs of endosymbionts
   (Curculioniphilus-Serratia, Curculioniphilus-Wolbachia,
   Sodalis-Rickettsia, Wolbachia-Rickettsia and Rickettsia-Spiroplasma)
   co-infected the same host individuals more frequently than expected,
   while infections with Serratia and Wolbachia were negatively correlated
   to each other. Infection frequencies of the endosymbionts were
   significantly correlated with climatic and ecological factors: for
   example, higher Sodalis, Wolbachia and Rickettsia infections at
   localities of higher temperature; lower Wolbachia and Rickettsia
   infections at localities of greater snowfall; and higher
   Curculioniphilus, Sodalis, Serratia, Wolbachia and Rickettsia infections
   on acorns than on chestnuts. These patterns are discussed in relation to
   potential host-endosymbiont co-evolution via local adaptation across
   geographical populations.}},

Abstract = {{How cooperation can arise and persist, given the threat of cheating
   phenotypes, is a central problem in evolutionary biology, but the actual
   significance of cheating in natural populations is still poorly
   understood. Theories of social evolution predict that cheater lineages
   are evolutionarily short-lived. However, an exception comes from
   obligate socially parasitic species, some of which thought to have
   arisen as cheaters within cooperator colonies and then diverged through
   sympatric speciation. This process requires the cheater lineage to
   persist by avoiding rapid extinction that would result from the fact
   that the cheaters inflict fitness cost on their host. We examined
   whether this prerequisite is fulfilled, by estimating the persistence
   time of cheaters in a field population of the parthenogenetic ant
   Pristomyrmex punctatus. Population genetic analysis found that the
   cheaters belong to one monophyletic lineage which we infer has persisted
   for 200-9200 generations. We show that the cheaters migrate and are thus
   horizontally transmitted between colonies, a trait allowing the lineage
   to avoid rapid extinction with its host colony. Although horizontal
   transmission of disruptive cheaters has the potential to induce
   extinction of the entire population, such collapse is likely averted
   when there is spatially restricted migration in a structured population,
   a scenario that matches the observed isolation by distance pattern that
   we found. We compare our result with other examples of disruptive and
   horizontally transmissible cheater lineages in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Translocations of Baltic whitefish (Coregonus sp.) into Austrian Alpine
   lakes have created `artificial hybrid zones', threatening the genetic
   integrity of native lineages. We evaluate the genetic structure of
   Coregonus in Austrian lakes and characterize hybridization and
   introgression between native and introduced lineages. Fifteen
   populations (N = 747) were assessed for allelic variation at eight
   microsatellite loci and a reduced set (N = 253) for variation across two
   mtDNA genes (cyt b and NADH-3). Bayesian approaches were used to
   estimate individual admixture proportions (q-values) and classify
   genotypes as native, introduced or hybrids. q-value distributions varied
   among populations highlighting differential hybridization and
   introgression histories. Many lakes revealed a clear distinction between
   native and introduced genotypes despite hybridization, whereas some
   locations revealed hybrid swarms. Genetic structure among lakes was
   congruent with morphological divergence and novelty raising speculation
   of multiple taxa, including a population south of the Alps, outside the
   putative native range of Coregonus. Although statistically congruent
   with inferences based on nuclear markers, mitochondrial haplotype data
   was not diagnostic with respect to native and non-native lineages,
   supporting that the Alpine region was colonized post-glacially by an
   admixture of mtDNA lineages, which coalesce > 1 Ma. Mechanisms promoting
   or eroding lineage isolation are discussed, as well as a high potential
   to conserve native Alpine lineages despite the extensive historical use
   of introduced Baltic stocks.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{473-485}},

Abstract = {{One of the greatest threats to the long-term viability of migrating
   plant species is the loss of genetic diversity due to founder effects.
   Populations can expand as a response to climate change, but it is
   uncertain if long-lived plant species can maintain sufficient genetic
   diversity at the leading edge of migrating populations. This study uses
   an expanding Larix decidua population investigated along a
   chronosequence at landscape (350 ha) and local (0.8 ha) scales to test
   whether accelerated migration as a result of climate warming has the
   potential to intensify genetic erosion. Nine SSR markers revealed
   similar genetic diversity among eight sub-populations along the
   chronosequence (overall H-e = 0.73; SE = 0.04). Sub-populations were not
   genetically differentiated and all sampled individuals (N = 730) formed
   one major genetic cluster indicating homogenizing gene flow despite
   spatial genetic structure (SGS) up to 80 m. At the local scale,
   individuals at the leading edge {[}early successional sub-population
   (ESSP), N = 140] and a sub-population at equilibrium {[}late
   successional sub-population (LSSP), N = 290] revealed high genetic
   diversity in largest-sized cohorts. SGS among juveniles occurred up to
   30 m in LSSP but there was no structure in ESSP. Accordingly, a maximum
   likelihood paternity assignment revealed local gene dispersal in LSSP
   (2-48 m) and intermediate-to-long distance dispersal into ESSP (115-3132
   m). The findings indicate intensive mixing of the genes in this
   expanding population instead of founder effects and support the view
   that genetic diversity can be maintained in a long-lived species during
   rapid population expansion driven by climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been a source
   of considerable research interest, owing in large part to the growing
   body of evidence that they may be subject to both natural and sexual
   selection. However, much remains to be learned about the dynamics of MHC
   genes in subdivided populations, particularly those characterized by
   divergent ecological pressures. In this study, we attempt to disentangle
   the relative roles of both parasite-mediated selection and MHC-mediated
   mate choice in an open estuarine system inhabited by two parapatric,
   adaptively divergent threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
   demes. We sequenced the putative peptide-binding region (PBR) of an
   estimated four Class II beta loci from 127 individuals, identifying 329
   sequence variants (276 translated amino acid sequences). Demes differed
   significantly both in the frequency of MHC alleles and in the
   communities of helminth parasites infecting resident sticklebacks.
   Strong signatures of natural selection were inferred from analyses of
   codon substitutions, particularly in the derived (freshwater) rather
   than the ancestral (marine) deme. Relationships between parasite load
   and MHC diversity were indicative of balancing selection, but only
   within the freshwater deme. Signals of MHC-mediated mate choice were
   weak and differed significantly between demes. Moreover, MHC-mediated
   mate choice was significantly influenced by environmental salinity and
   appeared of secondary importance to tendencies towards assortative
   mating. We discuss the implications of these findings in respect to
   ecological adaptation and the potential demographic consequences of
   possible outcomes of MHC-mediated mate choice.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape the
   genetic structure of invasive populations and facilitate their expansion
   across a large spectrum of environments is critical for the prediction
   of spread and management of ongoing invasions. Here, we study the
   dynamics of postestablishment colonization in the colonial ascidian
   Botrylloides violaceus, a notorious marine invader. After its initial
   introduction from the Northwest Pacific, B. violaceus spread rapidly
   along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, impacting both
   aquaculture facilities and natural ecosystems. We compare genetic
   diversity and patterns of gene flow among 25 populations (N = 679) from
   the West and East coasts, and evaluate the contribution of sexual vs.
   asexual reproduction to this species' invasion success using data from
   the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and 13
   nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci. Our results reveal contrasting
   patterns of spread in the coastal waters of North America. While the
   West coast was colonized by noncontiguous (long-distance) dispersal, the
   East coast invasion appears to have occurred through contiguous
   (stepping-stone) spread. Molecular data further indicate that although
   dispersal in colonial ascidians is predominantly achieved through
   sexually produced propagules, aquaculture practices such as
   high-pressure washing can facilitate fragmentation and potentially
   exacerbate infestations and spread via asexual propagules. The results
   presented here suggest that caution should be used against the general
   assumption that all invasions, even within a single species, exhibit
   similar patterns of colonization, as highly contrasting dynamics may
   transpire in different invaded ranges.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has displaced the
   native congener Mytilus trossulus from central and southern California,
   but the native species remains dominant at more northerly sites that
   have high levels of freshwater input. To determine the extent to which
   interspecific differences in physiological tolerance to low salinity
   might explain limits to the invasive species' biogeography, we used an
   oligonucleotide microarray to compare the transcriptional responses of
   these two species to an acute decrease in salinity. Among 6777 genes on
   the microarray, 117 genes showed significant changes that were similar
   between species, and 12 genes showed significant species-specific
   responses to salinity stress. Osmoregulation and cell cycle control were
   important aspects of the shared transcriptomic response to salinity
   stress, whereas the genes with species-specific expression patterns were
   involved in mRNA splicing, polyamine synthesis, exocytosis, translation,
   cell adhesion, and cell signalling. Forty-five genes that changed
   expression significantly during salinity stress also changed expression
   during heat stress, but the direction of change in expression was
   typically opposite for the two forms of stress. These results (i)
   provide insights into the role of changes in gene expression in
   establishing physiological tolerance to acute decreases in salinity, and
   (ii) indicate that transcriptomic differences between M.
   galloprovincialis and M. trossulus in response to salinity stress are
   subtle and involve only a minor fraction of the overall suite of gene
   regulatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that colonizes a great
   variety of environments. One trait that shows abundant evidence for
   naturally segregating genetic variance in different populations of D.
   melanogaster is cold tolerance. Previous work has found quantitative
   trait loci (QTL) exclusively on the second and the third chromosomes. To
   gain insight into the genetic architecture of cold tolerance on the X
   chromosome and to compare the results with our analyses of selective
   sweeps, a mapping population was derived from a cross between
   substitution lines that solely differed in the origin of their X
   chromosome: one originates from a European inbred line and the other one
   from an African inbred line. We found a total of six QTL for cold
   tolerance factors on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. Although the
   composite interval mapping revealed slightly different QTL profiles
   between sexes, a coherent model suggests that most QTL overlapped
   between sexes, and each explained around 5-14\% of the genetic variance
   (which may be slightly overestimated). The allelic effects were largely
   additive, but we also detected two significant interactions. Taken
   together, this provides evidence for multiple QTL that are spread along
   the entire X chromosome and whose effects range from low to
   intermediate. One detected transgressive QTL influences cold tolerance
   in different ways for the two sexes. While females benefit from the
   European allele increasing their cold tolerance, males tend to do better
   with the African allele. Finally, using selective sweep mapping, the
   candidate gene CG16700 for cold tolerance colocalizing with a QTL was
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{As populations adapt to novel environments, divergent selection will
   promote heterogeneous genomic differentiation via reductions in gene
   flow for loci underlying adaptive traits. Using a data set of over 100
   SNP markers, genome scans were performed to investigate the effect of
   natural selection maintaining differentiation in five lakes harbouring
   sympatric pairs of normal and dwarf lake whitefish (Coregonus
   clupeaformis). A variable proportion of SNPs (between 0\% and 12\%) was
   identified as outliers, which corroborated the predicted intensity of
   competitive interactions unique to each lake. Moreover, strong reduction
   in heterozygosity was typically observed for outlier loci in dwarf but
   not in normal whitefish, indicating that directional selection has been
   acting on standing genetic variation more intensively in dwarf
   whitefish. SNP associations in backcross hybrid progeny identified 16
   genes exhibiting genotype-phenotype associations for four adaptive
   traits (growth, swimming activity, gill rakers and condition factor).
   However, neither simple relationship between elevated levels of genetic
   differentiation with adaptive phenotype nor conspicuous genetic
   signatures for parallelism at outlier loci were detected, which
   underscores the importance of independent evolution among lakes. The
   integration of phenotypic, transcriptomic and functional genomic
   information identified two candidate genes (sodium potassium ATPase and
   triosephosphate isomerase) involved in the recent ecological divergence
   of lake whitefish. Finally, the identification of several markers under
   divergent selection suggests that many genes, in an environment-specific
   manner, are recruited by selection and ultimately contributed to the
   repeated ecological speciation of a dwarf phenotype.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Proposals for genetic thresholds for species delimitation assume that
   simple genetic data sets (e.g. mitochondrial sequence data) are
   correlated with speciation; i.e. such data sets accurately reflect
   organismal lineage divergence. We used taxonomically stratified
   phenotypic levels of differentiation (populations, subspecies and
   species) among nine avian lineages using paired, trans-Beringian samples
   from three lineages each in three orders (Anseriformes, Charadriiformes,
   and Passeriformes) to test this assumption. Using mitochondrial DNA
   sequence data and nuclear genomic data (amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms), we found a lack of concordance between these two genomes
   in their respective estimates of divergence and little or no
   relationship between phenotype (taxonomic relatedness) and genetic
   differentiation between taxon pairs. There are several possible reasons
   for the discord observed (e.g. selection on one of the genomes or
   perhaps lineage sorting), but the implications are that genetic
   estimates of lineage divergence may not be correlated with estimates
   from other parts of the genome, are not well correlated with the
   speciation process and are thus not reliable indicators of species

Abstract = {{Multipartite symbioses are complex symbiotic relationships involving

   excellent opportunities in which to apply a comparative approach to
   identify common historical patterns of population differentiation and

   fungal species (Ophiostomatacea) associated with outbreaking populations
   of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in western
   Canada, we applied phylogenetic, population genetic and demographic
   approaches to clarify phylogeographic patterns among the three fungal
   species. Broadly, the three species showed significant population
   differentiation, forming northern and southern populations, despite
   dramatic differences in haplotype diversity. Finer structuring and
   population demographic patterns were less consistent, showing some
   interspecific incongruence. By contrasting these species simultaneously,
   we were able to identify differences in recombination rate and
   ecological traits that can explain the observed patterns of incongruence
   among the fungal species. By applying a comparative approach to partners
   of a multipartite symbiosis, we were able to distinguish congruent
   population structuring and species-specific differences that help us to
   understand the complexity and evolution of this symbiotic system.}},

Abstract = {{Diversification of freshwater fishes on islands is considered unlikely
   because the traits that enable successful colonization-specifically,
   broad salinity tolerances and the potential for oceanic dispersal-may
   also constrain post-colonization genetic differentiation. Some secondary
   freshwater fish, however, exhibit pronounced genetic differentiation and
   geographic structure on islands, whereas others do not. It is unclear
   what conditions give rise to contrasting patterns of differentiation
   because few comparative reconstructions of population history have been
   carried out for insular freshwater fishes. In this study, we examined
   the phylogeography of Hart's killifish (Rivulus hartii) across Trinidad,
   with reference to neighboring islands and northern South America, to
   test hypotheses of colonization and differentiation derived from
   comparable work on co-occurring guppies (Poecilia reticulata).
   Geographic patterns of mitochondrial DNA haplotype variation and
   microsatellite genotype variation provide evidence of genetic
   differentiation of R. hartii among islands and across Trinidad. Our
   findings are largely consistent with patterns of geographically
   structured ancestry and admixture found in Trinidadian guppies, which
   suggests that both species share a history of colonization and
   differentiation and that post-colonization diversification may be more
   common among members of insular freshwater fish assemblages than has
   been previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Specialized relationships with bacteria often allow animals to exploit a
   new diet by providing a novel set of metabolic capabilities. Bees are a
   monophyletic group of Hymenoptera that transitioned to a completely
   herbivorous diet from the carnivorous diet of their wasp ancestors.
   Recent culture-independent studies suggest that a set of distinctive
   bacterial species inhabits the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera.
   Here we survey the gut microbiotae of diverse bee and wasp species to
   test whether acquisition of these bacteria was associated with the
   transition to herbivory in bees generally. We found that most bee
   species lack phylotypes that are the same or similar to those typical of
   A. mellifera, rejecting the hypothesis that this dietary transition was
   symbiont-dependent. The most common bacteria in solitary bee species are
   a widespread phylotype of Burkholderia and the pervasive insect
   associate, Wolbachia. In contrast, several social representatives of
   corbiculate bees do possess distinctive bacterial phylotypes. Samples of
   A. mellifera harboured the same microbiota as in previous surveys, and
   closely related bacterial phylotypes were identified in two Asian honey
   bees (Apis andreniformis and Apis dorsata) and several bumble bee
   (Bombus) species. Potentially, the sociality of Apis and Bombus species
   facilitates symbiont transmission and thus is key to the maintenance of
   a more consistent gut microbiota. Phylogenetic analyses provide a more
   refined taxonomic placement of the A. mellifera symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Population genetic structure of North Atlantic killer whale samples was
   resolved from differences in allele frequencies of 17 microsatellite
   loci, mtDNA control region haplotype frequencies and for a subset of
   samples, using complete mitogenome sequences. Three significantly
   differentiated populations were identified. Differentiation based on
   microsatellite allele frequencies was greater between the two allopatric
   populations than between the two pairs of partially sympatric
   populations. Spatial clustering of individuals within each of these
   populations overlaps with the distribution of particular prey resources:
   herring, mackerel and tuna, which each population has been seen
   predating. Phylogenetic analyses using complete mitogenomes suggested
   two populations could have resulted from single founding events and
   subsequent matrilineal expansion. The third population, which was
   sampled at lower latitudes and lower density, consisted of maternal
   lineages from three highly divergent clades. Pairwise population
   differentiation was greater for estimates based on mtDNA control region
   haplotype frequencies than for estimates based on microsatellite allele
   frequencies, and there were no mitogenome haplotypes shared among
   populations. This suggests low or no female migration and that gene flow
   was primarily male mediated when populations spatially and temporally
   overlap. These results demonstrate that genetic differentiation can
   arise through resource specialization in the absence of physical
   barriers to gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of the structure and function of microbial communities are
   highly constrained by the diversity of organisms present within most
   environmental samples. A common approach is to rely almost entirely on
   DNA sequence data for estimates of microbial diversity, but to date
   there is no objective method of clustering sequences into groups that is
   grounded in evolutionary theory of what constitutes a biological
   lineage. The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model uses a
   likelihood-based approach to distinguish population-level processes
   within lineages from processes associated with speciation and
   extinction, thus identifying a distinct point where extant lineages
   became independent. Using two independent surveys of DNA sequences
   associated with a group of ubiquitous plant-symbiotic fungi, we compared
   estimates of species richness derived using the GMYC model to those
   based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined by fixed levels of
   sequence similarity. The model predicted lower species richness in these
   surveys than did traditional methods of sequence similarity. Here, we
   show for the first time that groups delineated by the GMYC model better
   explained variation in the distribution of fungi in relation to putative
   niche-based variables associated with host species identity, edaphic
   factors, and aspects of how the sampled ecosystems were managed. Our
   results suggest the coalescent-based GMYC model successfully groups
   environmental sequences of fungi into clusters that are ecologically
   more meaningful than more arbitrary approaches for estimating species
   richness.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of landscape genetics, the basic assumptions and
   predictions of classical population genetic theories are being
   re-evaluated to account for more complex spatial and temporal dynamics.
   Within the last decade, there has been an exponential increase in such
   landscape genetic studies (Holderegger \& Wagner 2006; Storfer et al.
   2010), and both methodology and underlying concepts of the field are
   under rapid and constant development. A number of major innovations and
   a high level of originality are required to fully merge existing
   population genetic theory with landscape ecology and to develop novel
   statistical approaches for measuring and predicting genetic patterns.
   The importance of simulation studies for this specific research has been
   emphasized in a number of recent articles (e.g., Balkenhol et al. 2009a;
   Epperson et al. 2010). Indeed, many of the major questions in landscape
   genetics require the development and application of sophisticated
   simulation tools to explore gene flow, genetic drift, mutation and
   natural selection in landscapes with a wide range of spatial and
   temporal complexities. In this issue, Jaquiery et al. (2011) provide an
   excellent example of such a simulation study for landscape genetics.
   Using a metapopulation simulation design and a novel `scale of
   phenomena' approach, Jaquiery et al. (2011) demonstrate the utility and
   limitations of genetic distances for inferring landscape effects on
   effective dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the molecular basis of how new species arise is a central
   question and prime challenge in evolutionary biology and includes
   understanding how genomes diversify. Eukaryotic cells possess an
   integrated compartmentalized genetic system of endosymbiotic ancestry.
   The cellular subgenomes in nucleus, mitochondria and plastids
   communicate in a complex way and co-evolve. The application of hybrid
   and cybrid technologies, most notably those involving interspecific
   exchanges of plastid and nuclear genomes, has uncovered a multitude of
   species-specific nucleo-organelle interactions. Such interactions can
   result in plastome-genome incompatibilities, which can phenotypically
   often be recognized as hybrid bleaching, hybrid variegation or
   disturbance of the sexual phase. The plastid genome, because of its
   relatively low number of genes, can serve as a valuable tool to
   investigate the origin of these incompatibilities. In this article, we
   review progress on understanding how plastome-genome co-evolution
   contributes to speciation. We genetically classify incompatible
   phenotypes into four categories. We also summarize genetic,
   physiological and environmental influence and other possible selection
   forces acting on plastid-nuclear co-evolution and compare taxa providing
   molecular access to the underlying loci. It appears that plastome-genome
   incompatibility can establish hybridization barriers, comparable to the
   Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation processes. Evidence suggests that
   the plastid-mediated hybridization barriers associated with hybrid
   bleaching primarily arise through modification of components in
   regulatory networks, rather than of complex, multisubunit structures
   themselves that are frequent targets.}},

Abstract = {{The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been described as a species with low
   levels of genetic variation. This has been suggested to be the
   consequence of a demographic bottleneck 10 000-12 000 years ago (ya) and
   also led to the assumption that only small genetic differences exist
   between the described subspecies. However, analysing mitochondrial DNA
   and microsatellites in cheetah samples from most of the historic range
   of the species we found relatively deep phylogeographic breaks between
   some of the investigated populations, and most of the methods assessed
   divergence time estimates predating the postulated bottleneck.
   Mitochondrial DNA monophyly and overall levels of genetic
   differentiation support the distinctiveness of Northern-East African
   cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). Moreover, combining
   archaeozoological and contemporary samples, we show that Asiatic
   cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) are unambiguously separated from
   African subspecies. Divergence time estimates from mitochondrial and
   nuclear data place the split between Asiatic and Southern African
   cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) at 32 000-67 000 ya using an average
   mammalian microsatellite mutation rate and at 4700-44 000 ya employing
   human microsatellite mutation rates. Cheetahs are vulnerable to
   extinction globally and critically endangered in their Asiatic range,
   where the last 70-110 individuals survive only in Iran. We demonstrate
   that these extant Iranian cheetahs are an autochthonous monophyletic
   population and the last representatives of the Asiatic subspecies A. j.
   venaticus. We advocate that conservation strategies should consider the
   uncovered independent evolutionary histories of Asiatic and African
   cheetahs, as well as among some African subspecies. This would
   facilitate the dual conservation priorities of maintaining locally
   adapted ecotypes and genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogen-driven balancing selection maintains high genetic diversity in
   many vertebrates, particularly in the major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) immune system gene family, which is often associated with disease
   susceptibility. In large natural populations where subpopulations face
   different pathogen pressures, the MHC should show greater genetic
   differentiation within a species than neutral markers. We examined
   genetic diversity at the MHC-DQB locus and nine putatively neutral
   microsatellite markers in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) from eight
   United Kingdom (UK) colonies, the Faeroe Islands and Sable Island,
   Canada. Five DQB alleles were identified in grey seals, which varied in
   prevalence across the grey seal range. Among the seal colonies,
   significant differences in DQB allele and haplotype frequencies and in
   average DQB heterozygosity were observed. Additionally, the DQB gene
   exhibited greater differentiation among colonies compared with neutral
   markers, yet a weaker pattern of isolation by distance (IBD). After
   correcting for the underlying IBD pattern, subpopulations breeding in
   similar habitats were more similar to one another in DQB allele
   frequencies than populations breeding in different habitats, but the
   same did not hold true for microsatellites, suggesting that
   habitat-specific pathogen pressure influences MHC evolution. Overall,
   the data are consistent with selection at MHC-DQB loci in grey seals
   with both varying selective pressures and geographic population
   structure appearing to influence the DQB genetic composition of breeding
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{The monoicous peatmoss Sphagnum subnitens has a tripartite distribution
   that includes disjunct population systems in Europe (including the
   Azores), northwestern North America and New Zealand. Regional genetic
   diversity was highest in European S. subnitens but in northwestern North
   America, a single microsatellite-based multilocus haploid genotype was
   detected across 16 sites ranging from Coos County, Oregon, to Kavalga
   Island in the Western Aleutians (a distance of some 4115 km). Two
   multilocus haploid genotypes were detected across 14 sites on South
   Island, New Zealand. The microsatellite-based regional genetic diversity
   detected in New Zealand and North American S. subnitens is the lowest
   reported for any Sphagnum. The low genetic diversity detected in both of
   these regions most likely resulted from a founder event associated with
   vegetative propagation and complete selfing, with one founding haploid
   plant in northwest North America and two in New Zealand. Thus, one plant
   appears to have contributed 100\% of the gene pool for the population
   systems of S. subnitens occurring in northwest North America, and this
   is arguably the most genetically uniform group of plants having a
   widespread distribution yet detected. Although having a distribution
   spanning 12.5 degrees of latitude and 56 degrees of longitude, there was
   no evidence of any genetic diversification in S. subnitens in northwest
   North America. No genetic structure was detected among the three
   regions, and it appears that European plants of S. subnitens provided
   the source for New Zealand and northwest North American populations.}},

Title = {{Are low but statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation

   Atlantic cod}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A key question in many genetic studies on marine organisms is how to
   interpret a low but statistically significant level of genetic
   differentiation. Do such observations reflect a real phenomenon, or are
   they caused by confounding factors such as unrepresentative sampling or
   selective forces acting on the marker loci? Further, are low levels of
   differentiation biologically trivial, or can they represent a meaningful
   and perhaps important finding? We explored these issues in an empirical
   study on coastal Atlantic cod, combining temporally replicated genetic
   samples over a 10-year period with an extensive capture-mark-recapture
   study of individual mobility and population size. The genetic analyses
   revealed a pattern of differentiation between the inner part of the
   fjord and the open skerries area at the fjord entrance. Overall, genetic
   differentiation was weak (average F-ST = 0.0037), but nevertheless
   highly statistical significant and did not depend on particular loci
   that could be subject to selection. This spatial component dominated
   over temporal change, and temporal replicates clustered together
   throughout the 10-year period. Consistent with genetic results, the
   majority of the recaptured fish were found close to the point of
   release, with < 1\% of recaptured individuals dispersing between the
   inner fjord and outer skerries. We conclude that low levels of genetic
   differentiation in this marine fish can indeed be biologically
   meaningful, corresponding to separate, temporally persistent, local
   populations. We estimated the genetically effective sizes (N-e) of the
   two coastal cod populations to 198 and 542 and found a N-e/N (spawner)
   ratio of 0.14.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to environment is the cornerstone of ecological genetics. The
   subject of this study is a wild relative of the sequenced and annotated
   model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana. Caulanthus amplexicaulis var.
   barbarae lives on serpentine soils, known for high concentrations of
   heavy metals and low concentrations of essential plant macronutrients,
   and provides a compelling example of an organism's adaptation to
   environment. We constructed an F-2 linkage map, using a cross to the
   nonserpentine sister taxon, C. amplexicaulis var. amplexicaulis. C.
   amplexicaulis is a member of a highly diverse set of taxa (within the
   tribe Thelypodieae), described here as the `Streptanthoid Complex' that
   are adapted to a broad range of environments, yet share a common n = 14
   chromosome number and likely arose by a recent radiation. The linkage
   map consists of 97 polymorphic microsatellite markers, and 40
   exon-primed intron-crossing markers based on A. thaliana exon sequences
   and Brassica ESTs. The map covers 14 linkage groups and has a total
   length of 1513 cM. Both the patterns of marker segregation and the
   comparative map indicate that C. amplexicaulis is a diploid organism
   with a compact genome. All exon-primed intron-crossing markers, and an
   unexpectedly large number of microsatellite markers (83\%), had
   significant similarity to the A. thaliana genome, facilitating the
   development of a comparative genome map. As a proof of principle, we
   used the comparative map to identify candidate genes underlying
   differences in sepal colour between the two parent taxa. We demonstrate
   that the genomic tools developed here will be portable throughout the
   Streptanthoid Complex.}},

Abstract = {{We used 15 microsatellite markers to estimate the selfing rate (s),
   outcrossing rate (t(O)) and hybridization between partially sympatric
   ecomorphs (t(H)) of the coral Favia fragum. Genotyping of progeny arrays
   revealed complete self-fertilization in the Tall ecomorph and low
   outcrossing (t(O) + t(H) < 1\%) in the Short ecomorph. Further, all
   larvae could be assigned with high probability to the same population as
   their parental dam, indicating no hybridization between ecomorphs (t(H)
   = 0). Despite low ecological estimates of outcrossing, Q values from
   highly structured adult populations indicated that 9\% of the adult
   samples were the products of outcrossing, and an additional 11\% were
   hybrids. Reproductive isolation appears to have a strong geographical
   component, as we did not detect hybrids at a second site where the two
   ecomorphs were distributed in complete microallopatry. Adult estimates
   of gene flow within ecomorphs may be positively biased by
   ecomorph-specific patterns of inbreeding depression, but cryptic gene
   flow between ecomorphs is most likely explained by undetected
   outcrossing and the fact that hybrid lineages persist after repeated
   generations of self-fertilization. Our microsatellite data show that
   phenotypic differences between ecomorphs are maintained in sympatry
   despite evidence for hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The deep sea is a vast and essentially continuous environment with few
   obvious barriers to gene flow. How populations diverge and new species
   form in this remote ecosystem is poorly understood. Phylogeographical
   analyses have begun to provide some insight into evolutionary processes
   at bathyal depths (< 3000 m), but much less is known about evolution in
   the more extensive abyssal regions (> 3000 m). Here, we quantify
   geographical and bathymetric patterns of genetic variation (16S rRNA
   mitochondrial gene) in the protobranch bivalve Ledella ultima, which is
   one of the most abundant abyssal protobranchs in the Atlantic with a
   broad bathymetric and geographical distribution. We found virtually no
   genetic divergence within basins and only modest divergence among eight
   Atlantic basins. Levels of population divergence among basins were
   related to geographical distance and were greater in the South Atlantic
   than in the North Atlantic. Ocean-wide patterns of genetic variation
   indicate basin-wide divergence that exceeds what others have found for
   abyssal organisms, but considerably less than bathyal protobranchs
   across similar geographical scales. Populations on either side of the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic differed, suggesting the Ridge
   might impede gene flow at abyssal depths. Our results indicate that
   abyssal populations might be quite large (cosmopolitan), exhibit only
   modest genetic structure and probably provide little potential for the
   formation of new species.}},

Abstract = {{Social monogamy has traditionally been suggested to be maintained
   because of weak sexual selection on male partner acquisition. However,
   the ubiquitous incidence of extra-pair paternity suggests that sexual
   selection can be strong in monogamous systems, although studies
   partitioning variance in male reproductive success have come to mixed
   conclusions. Here, we use detailed field data to examine variance in
   male reproductive success and its implications for the maintenance of
   sociality in a population of the socially monogamous lizard Egernia
   whitii. We show that both within-pair and, to a lesser extent,
   extra-pair partner acquisition contribute to the variance in male
   reproductive success, resulting in considerable opportunity for sexual
   selection. Despite this, levels of multiple mating are lower in Egernia
   compared to other reptiles, suggesting that male partner acquisition is
   constrained. We suggest that this constraint may be a result of strong
   territoriality combined with sexual conflict over multiple mating
   generated by costs of extra-pair paternity to females as a result of
   facultative male care. This has the potential to limit sexual selection
   by reducing variance in male reproductive success and therefore
   contribute to the maintenance of complex social organization.}},

Abstract = {{The compelling elegance of using genome-wide scans to detect the
   signature of selection is difficult to resist, but is countered by the
   low demonstrated efficacy of pinpointing the actual genes and traits
   that are the targets of selection in nonmodel species. While the
   difficulty of going from a suggestive signature to a functional
   nucleotide polymorphism should not prevent researchers from using genome
   scans, it does lessen their long-term utility within and across study
   systems. In a new study published in this issue of Molecular Ecology
   (<link rid={''}b6{''}>Mariac et al. 2011), researchers have gone a long
   way towards increasing the relevance of genome-wide scans for selection
   via two approaches: (i) they tailored the markers used in the scan to
   target a family of developmental genes that were good candidates for
   controlling a trait of interest and (ii) they used an independent
   mapping population to confirm the association of the gene with
   polymorphism in the trait of interest. All of this was completed in the
   nonmodel system of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and may provide a
   road map for other researchers hoping to pin down solid candidate genes
   for selected traits in natural or cultivated systems. Outside of these
   broad methodological innovations, the paper specifically focuses on a
   trait (flowering time) that varies across an environmental gradient
   (rainfall). This environmental gradient potentially serves as a model
   for environmental change over time, and allele frequencies at the gene
   can therefore be used to track how populations of pearl millet will
   adapt to future climate shifts at the genetic level.}},

Title = {{How Prochlorococcus bacteria use nitrogen sparingly in their proteins}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Organisms use proteins to perform an enormous range of functions that
   are essential for life. Proteins are usually composed of 20 different
   kinds of amino acids that each contain between one and four nitrogen
   atoms. In aggregate, the nitrogen atoms that are bound in proteins
   typically account for a substantial fraction of the nitrogen in a cell.
   Many organisms obtain the nitrogen that they use to make proteins from
   the environment, where its availability can vary greatly. These
   observations prompt the question: can environmental nitrogen scarcity
   lead to adaptive evolution in the nitrogen content of proteins? In this
   issue, Gilbert \& Fagan (2011) address this question in the marine
   cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus, examining a variety of ways in which
   cells might be thrifty with nitrogen when making proteins. They show
   that different Prochlorococcus strains vary substantially in the average
   nitrogen content of their encoded proteins and relate this variation to
   nitrogen availability in different marine habitats and to genomic base
   composition (GC content). They also consider biases in the nitrogen
   content of different kinds of proteins. In most Prochlorococcus strains,
   a group of proteins that are commonly induced during nitrogen stress are
   poor in nitrogen relative to other proteins, probably reflecting
   selection for reduced nitrogen content. In contrast, ribosomal proteins
   are nitrogen rich relative to other Prochlorococcus proteins, and tend
   to be down-regulated during nitrogen limitation. This suggests the
   possibility that decaying ribosomal proteins act as a source of
   nitrogen-rich amino acids during periods of nitrogen stress. This work
   contributes to our understanding of how nutrient limitation might lead
   to adaptive variation in the composition of proteins and signals that
   marine microbes hold great promise for testing hypotheses about protein
   elemental costs in the future.}},

Title = {{High genetic diversity in the remnant island population of hihi and the
   genetic consequences of re-introduction}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The maintenance of genetic diversity is thought to be fundamental for
   the conservation of threatened species. It is therefore important to
   understand how genetic diversity is affected by the re-introduction of
   threatened species. We use establishment history and genetic data from
   the remnant and re-introduced populations of a New Zealand endemic bird,
   the hihi Notiomystis cincta, to understand genetic diversity loss and
   quantify the genetic effects of re-introduction. Our data do not support
   any recent bottleneck events in the remnant population. Furthermore, all
   genetic diversity measures indicate the remnant hihi population has
   retained high levels of genetic diversity relative to other New Zealand
   avifauna with similar histories of decline. Genetic diversity (N-A,
   alleles per locus, allelic richness, F-IS and H-S) did not significantly
   decrease in new hihi populations founded through re-introduction when
   compared to their source populations, except in the Kapiti Island
   population (allelic richness and H-S) which had very slow
   post-re-introduction population growth. The N-e/N-c ratio in the remnant
   population was high, but decreased in first-level re-introductions,
   which together with significant genetic differentiation between
   populations (F-ST \& Fisher's exact tests) suggest that extant
   populations are diverging as a result of founder effects and drift.
   Importantly, simulations of future allele loss predict that the number
   of alleles lost will be higher in populations with a slow population
   growth, fewer founding individuals and with nonrandom mating.
   Interestingly, this species has very high levels of extra-pair paternity
   which may reduce reproductive variance by allowing social and floater
   males to reproduce a life history trait that together with a large
   remnant population size may help maintain higher levels of genetic
   diversity than expected.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect two-generation analysis of pollen flow has proven to be an
   effective alternative to exhaustive paternity analysis in numerous plant
   populations. In this investigation, the method is extended to an annual
   wild maize species, Zea mays ssp. parviglumis (Poaceae). Our analysis of
   mating system in parviglumis revealed high levels of outcrossing and
   higher biparental inbreeding than typically observed in grasses. Pollen
   dispersal analysis suggested low levels of long-distance dispersal.
   Given previous evidence for intrapopulation genetic structure in
   parviglumis populations, we explored the impact of cryptic population
   structure on estimates of mating system and pollen flow. Subpopulations
   inferred through spatially explicit Bayesian assignment showed markedly
   different values for both mating system parameters and pollen flow than
   the entire population. Finally, a novel method of pollen haplotype
   assignment revealed nonrandom mating consistent with intrapopulation
   structure. These results indicate parviglumis could be particularly
   susceptible to habitat fragmentation currently occurring throughout
   Mexico due to recent changes in land use.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a complex event that maintains many ecological systems. The
   Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi) is precinctive to Florida
   Scrub, a habitat that is maintained by infrequent fire. We characterize
   the effect of fire on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation at
   eight microsatellite loci in the Florida Sand Skink (n = 470) collected
   from 30 replicate sites over three `time since last fire' categories at
   the Archbold Biological Station. Long unburned sites had greater allelic
   richness and expected heterozygosity than either recently or
   intermediately burned sites. More recently, burned sites had greater
   standard deviations of allelic richness and private allelic richness.
   Expected heterozygosity positively correlated with `time since fire' (r
   = 0.36, P = 0.05) and abundance (r = 0.53, P = 0.002). There was a
   significant spatial component to genetic differentiation, and results
   indicate individuals rarely disperse > 1 km. Genetic differentiation was
   positively correlated with geographic distance in long unburned units (r
   = 0.59, P = 0.04), yet this relationship was disrupted by fire in
   recently (r = 0.00, 1) and intermediately (r = -0.81, 0.05) burned
   areas. Simulations indicate that demographic changes to a local
   population could have generated the observed differences among `time
   since fire' categories. Our findings indicate that infrequent fire may
   be beneficial to the Florida Sand Skink and that local populations begin
   to recover from changes attributable to the fire after 10 years. Too
   frequent fires may reduce genetic diversity because it may take multiple
   generations for local populations to recover.}},

Title = {{The imprecision of heterozygosity-fitness correlations hinders the
   detection of inbreeding and inbreeding depression in a threatened
   species}},

Abstract = {{In nonpedigreed wild populations, inbreeding depression is often
   quantified through the use of heterozygosity-fitness correlations
   (HFCs), based on molecular estimates of relatedness. Although such
   correlations are typically interpreted as evidence of inbreeding
   depression, by assuming that the marker heterozygosity is a proxy for
   genome-wide heterozygosity, theory predicts that these relationships
   should be difficult to detect. Until now, the vast majority of empirical
   research in this area has been performed on generally outbred,
   nonbottlenecked populations, but differences in population genetic
   processes may limit extrapolation of results to threatened populations.
   Here, we present an analysis of HFCs, and their implications for the
   interpretation of inbreeding, in a free-ranging pedigreed population of
   a bottlenecked species: the endangered takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri).
   Pedigree-based inbreeding depression has already been detected in this
   species. Using 23 microsatellite loci, we observed only weak evidence of
   the expected relationship between multilocus heterozygosity and fitness
   at individual life-history stages (such as survival to hatching and
   fledging), and parameter estimates were imprecise (had high error).
   Furthermore, our molecular data set could not accurately predict the
   inbreeding status of individuals (as `inbred' or `outbred', determined
   from pedigrees), nor could we show that the observed HFCs were the
   result of genome-wide identity disequilibrium. These results may be
   attributed to high variance in heterozygosity within inbreeding classes.
   This study is an empirical example from a free-ranging endangered
   species, suggesting that even relatively large numbers (> 20) of
   microsatellites may give poor precision for estimating individual
   genome-wide heterozygosity. We argue that pedigree methods remain the
   most effective method of quantifying inbreeding in wild populations,
   particularly those that have gone through severe bottlenecks.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the molecular bases of adaptation is a key issue in
   evolutionary biology. Genome scan is an efficient approach for
   identifying important molecular variation involved in adaptation.
   Association mapping also offers an opportunity to gain insight into
   genotype-phenotype relationships. Using these two approaches coupled
   with environmental data should help to come up with a refined picture of
   the evolutionary process underlying adaptation. In this study, we first
   conducted a selection scan analysis on a transcription factor gene
   family. We focused on the MADS-box gene family, a gene family which
   plays a crucial role in vegetative and flower development. Twenty-one
   pearl millet populations were sampled along an environmental gradient in
   West Africa. We identified one gene, i.e. PgMADS11, using Bayesian
   analysis to detect selection signatures. Polymorphism at this gene was
   also associated with flowering time variation in an association mapping
   framework. Finally, we found that PgMADS11 allele frequencies were
   closely associated with annual rainfall. Overall, we determined an
   efficient way to detect functional polymorphisms associated with climate
   variation in non-model plants by combining genome scan and association
   mapping. These results should help monitor the impact of recent climatic
   changes on plant adaptation.}},

Title = {{Contrasting mechanisms of proteomic nitrogen thrift in Prochlorococcus}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Organisms limited by carbon, nitrogen or sulphur can reduce protein
   production costs by transitions to less costly amino acids, or by
   reducing protein expression. These alternative mechanisms of nutrient
   thrift might respond differently to selection, but this possibility
   remains untested. We hypothesized that relatively invariant sequence
   composition responds to long-term variation in nutrient concentrations,
   whereas dynamic expression profiles vary with nutrient predictability.
   Prolonged nutrient scarcity favours proteome-wide nutrient reduction.
   Under stable, nonfluctuating nutrient availability, reduction of
   nutrient content typically occurs in proteins upregulated when nutrient
   availability is low, e.g. assimilation and catabolism. We suggest that
   fluctuating nutrient availability favours mechanisms involving
   short-term downregulation of nutrient-rich proteins. We analysed protein
   nitrogen content in six high-light, low-nutrient adapted (HL) vs. six
   low-light, high-nutrient adapted (LL) Prochlorococcus (marine
   cyanobacteria) strains, alongside expression data under experimental
   nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in two strains, MED4 (HL) vs. MIT9313
   (LL). HL strains contained less nitrogen, but DNA GC content confounded
   this relationship. While anabolic and catabolic proteins had normal
   nitrogen content, most strains showed reduced nitrogen in typical
   nitrogen stress response proteins. In the experimental data set, though,
   proteins upregulated under nitrogen limitation were nitrogen-poor only
   in MIT9313, not MED4. MIT9313 responded similarly to nitrogen and
   phosphorus limitation, with slow, sustained downregulation of
   nitrogen-rich ribosomal proteins. In contrast, under nitrogen but not
   phosphorus limitation, MED4 rapidly downregulated ribosomal proteins.
   MED4's specific, rapid nitrogen response suggests adaptation to
   fluctuating conditions, supporting previous work. Thus, we identify
   contrasting proteomic nitrogen thrift mechanisms within Prochlorococcus
   consistent with different nutrient regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The merger of two or more divergent genomes within an allopolyploid
   nucleus can facilitate speciation and adaptive evolution in flowering
   plants. Widespread changes to gene expression have been shown to result
   from interspecific hybridisation and polyploidy in a number of plant
   species, and attention has now shifted to determining the epigenetic
   processes that drive these changes. We present here an analysis of
   cytosine methylation patterns in triploid F(1)Senecio (ragwort) hybrids
   and their allohexaploid derivatives. We observe that, in common with
   similar studies in Arabidopsis, Spartina and Triticum, a small but
   significant proportion of loci display nonadditive methylation in the
   hybrids, largely resulting from interspecific hybridisation. Despite
   this, genome duplication results in a secondary effect on methylation,
   with reversion to additivity at some loci and novel methylation status
   at others. We also observe differences in methylation state between
   different allopolyploid generations, predominantly in cases of additive
   methylation with regard to which parental methylation state is dominant.
   These changes to methylation state in both F-1 triploids and their
   allohexaploid derivatives largely mirror the overall patterns of
   nonadditive gene expression observed in our previous microarray analyses
   and may play a causative role in generating those expression changes.
   These similar global changes to DNA methylation resulting from
   hybridisation and genome duplication may serve as a source of epigenetic
   variation in natural populations, facilitating adaptive evolution. Our
   observations that methylation state can also vary between different
   generations of polyploid hybrids suggests that newly formed
   allopolyploid species may display a high degree of epigenetic diversity
   upon which natural selection can act.}},

Abstract = {{While insular radiations are documented for many terrestrial arthropods,
   few examples are known for eusocial insects. This study seeks to
   ascertain whether the spinescence observed among Fijian Pheidole ants
   was inherited from an oversea ancestor or is evidence of ecological
   release from interspecific competitors. We broaden our understanding of
   morphological convergence, insular radiation and Pacific biogeography by
   testing three hypotheses proposed previously for the Fijian Pheidole
   roosevelti group: (i) the group is monophyletic; (ii) spinescence is a
   plesiomorphic trait inherited from an overseas ancestor; and (iii) the
   group is closely related to spinescent New Guinean relatives. The
   analysis included the fragments of two mitochondrial genes (COI, cytb)
   and two nuclear genes (H3, EF1 alpha-F2) from 66 taxa, including all
   members of the roosevelti group, representatives from the spinescent
   subgenus Pheidolacanthinus, Fijian congeners and widespread Pacific
   congeners. Our results yield new insights into the biogeographic history
   of Fiji, reveal a fascinating example of convergent evolution and serve
   as a novel example of ecological release occurring within an insular
   eusocial insect lineage. These findings recover the history of a
   presumably unremarkable ant species that colonized a remote oceanic
   archipelago in the Miocene (17-10 Ma) and radiated across the emerging
   islands into niche-space occupied elsewhere in the Pacific by distantly
   related spinescent congeners. We propose the radiation of Fijian
   Pheidole into spinescent morphotypes was the consequence of ecological
   opportunities afforded by the absence of competing ant lineages with
   conspicuous epigaeic foraging strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the biogeographical histories of rainforests is central to
   our understanding of the present distribution of tropical biodiversity.
   Ice age fragmentation of central African rainforests strongly influenced
   species distributions. Elevated areas characterized by higher species
   richness and endemism have been postulated to be Pleistocene forest
   refugia. However, it is often difficult to separate the effects of
   history and of present-day ecological conditions on diversity patterns
   at the interspecific level. Intraspecific genetic variation could yield
   new insights into history, because refugia hypotheses predict patterns
   not expected on the basis of contemporary environmental dynamics. Here,
   we test geographically explicit hypotheses of vicariance associated with
   the presence of putative refugia and provide clues about their location.
   We intensively sampled populations of Aucoumea klaineana, a forest tree
   sensitive to forest fragmentation, throughout its geographical range.
   Characterizing variation at 10 nuclear microsatellite loci, we were able
   to obtain phylogeographic data of unprecedented detail for this region.
   Using Bayesian clustering approaches, we demonstrated the presence of
   four differentiated genetic units. Their distribution matched that of
   forest refugia postulated from patterns of species richness and
   endemism. Our data also show differences in diversity dynamics at
   leading and trailing edges of the species' shifting distribution. Our
   results confirm predictions based on refugia hypotheses and cannot be
   explained on the basis of present-day ecological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeographical patterns of marine and diadromous organisms are often
   influenced by dynamic ocean histories. For example, the marine realm
   around the Japanese Archipelago is an interesting area for
   phylogeographical research because of the wide variation in the
   environments driven by repeated shifts in sea level in the Quaternary.
   We analysed mitochondrial cyt b gene and nuclear myh6 gene sequences for
   individuals collected from throughout the range of the anadromous fish
   Leucopsarion petersii to assess the lineage divergence,
   phylogeographical pattern and historical demography in relation to
   geological history and oceanographic features around the archipelago.
   Leucopsarion petersii has two major lineages (the Japan Sea and Pacific
   Ocean lineages), which diverged during the late-early to middle
   Pleistocene. Geographical distributions of the two lineages were closely
   related to the pathways of the two warm currents, the Tsushima Current
   and the Kuroshio Current, that flow past the archipelago. Evidence of
   introgressive hybridization between these lineages was found at two
   secondary contact zones. Demographic tests suggested that the Japan Sea
   and Pacific Ocean lineages carried the genetic signal of different
   historical demographic processes, and these signals are probably
   associated with differences in habitat stability during recent glacial
   periods. The Japan Sea lineage has a larger body-size and more
   vertebrae, probably in relation to severe habitat conditions through
   Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Thus, the two lineages have long
   independent evolutionary histories, and the phylogeographical structure
   and demography of this species have been influenced both by historical
   events and the present-day oceanography around the Japanese Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Scattered populations of the same tree species in montane forests
   through Africa have led to speculations on the origins of distributions,
   Here, we inferred the colonization history of the Afromontane tree
   Prunus africana using seven chloroplast DNA loci to study 582
   individuals from 32 populations sampled in a range wide survey from
   across Africa, revealing 22 haplotypes The predominant haplotype, HT1a
   occurred in 13 populations of eastern and southern Africa, while a
   second common haplotype, HT1m, occurred in populations of western Uganda
   and western Africa. The high differentiation observed between
   populations in East Africa was unexpected, with stands in western Uganda
   belonging with the western African lineage High genetic differentiation
   among populations revealed using ordered alleles (N(ST) = 0.840)
   compared with unordered alleles (G(ST) = 0.735), indicated a clear
   phylogeographic pattern. Bayesian coalescence modelling suggested that
   `east' and `west' African types likely split early during southward
   migration of the species, while further more recent splitting events
   occurred among populations in the East of the continent The high genetic
   similarity found between western Uganda and west African populations
   indicates that a former Afromontane migration corridor may have existed
   through Equatorial Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Metamorphosing insects often have complex and poorly known life
   histories. In particular, what they feed on during their larval stages
   remains unknown for the vast majority of species, and its documentation
   only results from difficult and time-intensive field observations,
   rearing or dissections. Through the application of a DNA analysis of gut
   contents in adult parasitoid wasps, we were able to selectively sequence
   a diagnostic DNA marker that permitted the identification of the host
   used by these wasps during their larval stages. By reproducing these
   results in species with different life histories, we excluded other
   potential sources of host DNA, confirming that after ingestion by the
   parasitoid larva the host DNA can persist through metamorphosis in the
   abdominal contents of the adult wasp. Our discovery considerably extends
   the applicability of molecular analysis of gut contents by enabling the
   documentation of food used by insects during their larval stages and
   thus increasing the accuracy and precision of food web studies. The 24\%
   success rate of our approach is surprisingly high considering the
   challenging context for host DNA preservation, and we discuss the
   factors possibly affecting this rate. We propose molecular analysis of
   parasitoid linkages (MAPL) as a new method to document host-parasitoid
   associations at a faster pace and with unrivalled precision. Because of
   the key regulatory role of parasitoid wasps in ecosystems, which makes
   them the most commonly used biological control agents, MAPL will have
   immediate applications in both basic and applied biological sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the movement of individuals in the wild has always been a
   challenge in ecology. However, estimating such movement is essential in
   life sciences as it is the base-line for evaluating connectivity, a
   major component in developing management and conservation plans.
   Furthermore, movement, or migration, is an essential parameter in
   population genetics, as it directly affects genetic differentiation. The
   development of highly variable markers has allowed genetic
   discrimination between individuals within populations and at larger
   scales, and the availability of high-throughput technologies means that
   many samples and hence many individuals can be screened. These advances
   mean that we can now use genetic identification for tracking
   individuals, and hence follow both survival and reproductive output
   through the life cycle. The paper by Morrissey \& Ferguson (2011, this
   issue) is a demonstration of this new capability, as authors were able
   to infer the movement of salmonid fish initially captured as juveniles,
   and later as reproductively mature adults.}},

Title = {{A re-appraisal of nunatak survival in arctic-alpine phylogeography}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{190-192}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A long standing and at times fervid debate in biogeography revolves
   around the question whether arctic and high alpine organisms survived
   Pleistocene ice ages on small island-like areas protruding above the
   ice-sheet, so-called nunataks, or whether they did so in peripheral
   nonglaciated refugial areas. A common picture emerging from a plethora
   of molecular phylogeographic studies in the last decade is that both in
   the Arctic and in temperate mountain ranges such as the European Alps
   nunatak survival needs to be only rarely invoked to explain observed
   genetic patterns (for a rare example see Stehlik et al. 2002). As two
   studies in this issue show, depreciation of the nunatak hypothesis is,
   however, not warranted. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Westergaard
   et al. (2011) investigate genetic patterns of two arctic-alpine plant
   species distributed on both sides of the Atlantic exclusively in areas
   that were mostly covered by ice-sheets during Pleistocene glacial
   advances. In both species, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   data identified divergent and partly genetically diverse groups east and
   west of the Atlantic. This suggests, for the first time in Arctic
   plants, in situ survival on nunataks. In an entirely different
   geographic setting and on a different geographic scale, Lohse et al.
   (2011, this issue) study the colonization of high alpine areas in the
   Orobian Alps, situated within and adjacent to a prominent peripheral
   refugial area (massif de refuge) in the Southern Alps of northern Italy,
   by dispersal-limited carabid ground beetles. Using explicit hypothesis
   testing and inference of ancestral locations in a Bayesian framework,
   stepwise colonization from two separate southern refugia is found to
   shape the genetic pattern of these beetles, but at the northern edge,
   populations survived at least parts of the last glaciation in situ on
   nunataks.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Identification of loci with adaptive importance is a key step to
   understand the speciation process in natural populations, because those
   loci are responsible for phenotypic variation that affects fitness in
   different environments. We conducted an AFLP genome scan in populations
   of ocellated lizards (Lacerta lepida) to search for candidate loci
   influenced by selection along an environmental gradient in the Iberian
   Peninsula. This gradient is strongly influenced by climatic variables,
   and two subspecies can be recognized at the opposite extremes: L. lepida
   iberica in the northwest and L. lepida nevadensis in the southeast. Both
   subspecies show substantial morphological differences that may be
   involved in their local adaptation to the climatic extremes. To
   investigate how the use of a particular outlier detection method can
   influence the results, a frequentist method, DFDIST, and a Bayesian
   method, BayeScan, were used to search for outliers influenced by
   selection. Additionally, the spatial analysis method was used to test
   for associations of AFLP marker band frequencies with 54 climatic
   variables by logistic regression. Results obtained with each method
   highlight differences in their sensitivity. DFDIST and BayeScan detected
   a similar proportion of outliers (3-4\%), but only a few loci were
   simultaneously detected by both methods. Several loci detected as
   outliers were also associated with temperature, insolation or
   precipitation according to spatial analysis method. These results are in
   accordance with reported data in the literature about morphological and
   life-history variation of L. lepida subspecies along the environmental
   gradient.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically controlled colour polymorphisms provide a physical
   manifestation of the operation of selection and how this can vary
   according to the spatial or temporal arrangement of phenotypes, or their
   frequency in a population. Here, we examine the role of selection in
   shaping the exuberant colour polymorphism exhibited by the spider
   Theridion californicum. This species is part of a system in which
   several distantly related spiders in the same lineage, but living in
   very different geographical areas, exhibit remarkably convergent
   polymorphisms. These polymorphisms are characterized by allelic
   inheritance and the presence of a single common cryptic morph and, in
   the case of T. californicum and its congener the Hawaiian happy-face
   spider Theridion grallator, numerous rare patterned morphs. We compare
   population differentiation estimated from colour phenotypic data to
   differentiation at neutral amplified fragment length polymorphisms
   (AFLP) loci and demonstrate that the colour polymorphism appears to be
   maintained by balancing selection. We also examine the patterns of
   selection in the genome-wide sample of AFLP loci and compare approaches
   to detecting signatures of selection in this context. Our results have
   important implications regarding balancing selection, suggesting that
   selective agents can act in a similar manner across disparate taxa in
   globally disjunct locales resulting in parallel evolution of exuberant
   polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{We used a population genetic approach to quantify major population
   subdivisions and patterns of migration within a broadly distributed
   Indo-Pacific parrotfish. We genotyped 15 microsatellite loci in Scarus
   rubroviolaceus collected from 20 localities between Africa and the
   Americas. A STRUCTURE model indicates the presence of four major
   populations: Eastern Pacific, Hawaii, Central-West Pacific and a less
   well-differentiated Indian Ocean. We used the isolation and migration
   model to estimate splitting times, population sizes and migration
   patterns between sister population pairs. To eliminate loci under
   selection, we used BayeScan to select loci for three isolation and
   migration models: Eastern Pacific and Central-West Pacific, Hawaii and
   the Central-West Pacific, and Indian Ocean and the Central-West Pacific.
   To test the assumption of a stepwise mutation model (SMM), we used
   likelihood to test the SMM against a two-phase model that allowed
   mutational complexity. A posteriori, minor departures from SMM were
   estimated to affect < 2\% of the alleles in the data. The data were
   informative about the contemporary and ancestral population sizes,
   migration rates and the splitting time in the eastern
   Pacific/Central-West Pacific comparison. The model revealed a splitting
   time similar to 17 000 bp, a larger contemporary N-e in the Central-West
   Pacific than in the eastern Pacific and a strong bias of east to west
   migration. These characteristics support the Center of Accumulation
   model of peripatric diversification in low-diversity peripheral sites
   and perhaps migration from those sites to the western Pacific diversity
   hotspot.}},

Abstract = {{Stream-dwelling fish populations have long served as important models of
   animal movement. Populations of adult stream-dwelling fishes are
   generally composed of a mix of relatively sedentary and mobile
   individuals. However, we do not know whether this pattern that we
   typically observe among adults is indicative of patterns of movement
   that occur throughout the life cycle. Therefore, we do not know whether
   we can apply these patterns to understanding or predicting processes
   such as migration and thus the potential for the evolution of genetic
   differences among populations. We test the general hypothesis that
   patterns of movement throughout the life cycle are consistent with
   patterns of movement inferred by indirect genetic methods and, more
   specifically, that the characteristics of the mobile fraction of the
   population are consistent with patterns of genetic differentiation. We
   used parentage analyses to infer the movements of alevin brook charr
   (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Freshwater River, Newfoundland, Canada, and a
   capture-recapture study of one cohort in this population to infer
   movement throughout the rest of the life cycle. We found that alevins
   move large distances shortly after emergence, primarily in the
   downstream direction, and that the population is composed of a mix of
   relatively sedentary and mobile individuals throughout all other
   intervals of the life cycle. In contrast, when we considered movements
   of individuals first captured as juveniles and eventually recovered as
   reproductively mature adults, we found relatively large and uniform
   distributions of net movement distance. Thus, heterogeneity in
   individual movement of adults is not representative of patterns of
   movement throughout the life cycle and therefore may provide only
   limited inference of population-level processes such as gene flow.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The local resource competition hypothesis and the local mate competition
   hypothesis were developed based on avian and mammalian systems to
   explain sex-biased dispersal. Most avian species show a female bias in
   dispersal, ostensibly due to resource defence, and most mammals show a
   male bias, ostensibly due to male-male competition. These findings
   confound phylogeny with mating strategy; little is known about
   sex-biased dispersal in other taxa. Resource defence and male-male
   competition are both intense in Plethodon cinereus, a direct-developing
   salamander, so we tested whether sex-biased dispersal in this amphibian
   is consistent with the local resource competition hypothesis
   (female-biased) or the local mate competition hypothesis (male-biased).
   Using fine-scale genetic spatial autocorrelation analyses, we found that
   females were philopatric, showing significant positive genetic structure
   in the shortest distance classes, with stronger patterns apparent when
   only territorial females were tested. Males showed no spatial genetic
   structure over the shortest distances. Mark-recapture observations of P.
   cinereus over 5 years were consistent with the genetic data: males
   dispersed farther than females during natal dispersal and 44\% of
   females were recaptured within 1 m of their juvenile locations. We
   conclude that, in this population of a direct-developing amphibian,
   females are philopatric and dispersal is male-biased, consistent with
   the local mate competition hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial assemblages from subsurface (100 m depth), meso- (200-1000 m
   depth) and bathy-pelagic (below 1000 m depth) zones at 10 stations along
   a North Atlantic Ocean transect from 60 degrees N to 5 degrees S were
   characterized using massively parallel pyrotag sequencing of the V6
   region of the 16S rRNA gene (V6 pyrotags). In a dataset of more than 830
   000 pyrotags, we identified 10 780 OTUs of which 52\% were singletons.
   The singletons accounted for less than 2\% of the OTU abundance, whereas
   the 100 and 1000 most abundant OTUs represented 80\% and 96\%
   respectively of all recovered OTUs. Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling
   and Canonical Correspondence Analysis of all the OTUs excluding the
   singletons revealed a clear clustering of the bacterial communities
   according to the water masses. More than 80\% of the 1000 most abundant
   OTUs corresponded to Proteobacteria of which 55\% were
   Alphaproteobacteria, mostly composed of the SAR11 cluster.
   Gammaproteobacteria increased with depth and included a relatively large
   number of OTUs belonging to Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales. The
   bathypelagic zone showed higher taxonomic evenness than the overlying
   waters, albeit bacterial diversity was remarkably variable. Both
   abundant and low-abundance OTUs were responsible for the distinct
   bacterial communities characterizing the major deep-water masses. Taken
   together, our results reveal that deep-water masses act as
   bio-oceanographic islands for bacterioplankton leading to water
   mass-specific bacterial communities in the deep waters of the Atlantic.}},

Abstract = {{Results of diversity and community ecology studies strongly depend on
   sampling depth. Completely surveyed communities follow log-normal
   distribution, whereas power law functions best describe incompletely
   censused communities. It is arguable whether the statistics behind those
   theories can be applied to voluminous next generation sequencing data in
   microbiology by treating individual DNA sequences as counts of molecular
   taxonomic units (MOTUs). This study addresses the suitability of species
   abundance models in three groups of plant-associated fungal communities
   - phyllosphere, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We
   tested the impact of differential treatment of molecular singletons on
   observed and estimated species richness and species abundance
   distribution models. The arbuscular mycorrhizal community of 48 MOTUs
   was exhaustively sampled and followed log-normal distribution. The
   ectomycorrhizal (153 MOTUs) and phyllosphere (327 MOTUs) communities
   significantly differed from log-normal distribution. The fungal
   phyllosphere community in particular was clearly undersampled. This
   undersampling bias resulted in strong sensitivity to the exclusion of
   molecular singletons and other rare MOTUs that may represent technical
   artefacts. The analysis of abundant (core) and rare (satellite) MOTUs
   clearly identified two species abundance distributions in the
   phyllosphere data - a log-normal model for the core group and a
   log-series model for the satellite group. The prominent log-series
   distribution of satellite phyllosphere fungi highlighted the ecological
   significance of an infrequent fungal component in the phyllosphere
   community.}},

Abstract = {{Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbionts that can invade
   arthropod populations through manipulation of their reproduction. In
   mosquitoes, Wolbachia induce embryonic death, known as cytoplasmic
   incompatibility (CI), whenever infected males mate with females either
   uninfected or infected with an incompatible strain. Although genetic
   determinants of CI are unknown, a functional model involving the
   so-called mod and resc factors has been proposed. Natural populations of
   Culex pipiens mosquito display a complex CI relationship pattern
   associated with the highest Wolbachia (wPip) genetic polymorphism
   reported so far. We show here that C. pipiens populations from La
   Reunion, a geographically isolated island in the southwest of the Indian
   Ocean, are infected with genetically closely related wPip strains.
   Crossing experiments reveal that these Wolbachia are all mutually
   compatible. However, crosses with genetically more distant wPip strains
   indicate that Wolbachia strains from La Reunion belong to at least five
   distinct incompatibility groups (or crossing types). These
   incompatibility properties which are strictly independent from the
   nuclear background, formally establish that in C. pipiens, CI is
   controlled by several Wolbachia mod/resc factors.}},

Title = {{Intraspecific cone opsin expression variation in the cichlids of Lake
   Malawi}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{299-310}},

Abstract = {{The expression of cone opsin genes is a primary determinant of the
   characteristics of colour vision. Interspecific variation in opsin
   expression is common in African cichlids. It is correlated with foraging
   among cichlids from Lake Malawi, and with ambient light environment
   among cichlids from Lake Victoria. In this study, we tested whether gene
   expression varied within species such that it might be important in
   contributing to divergence. We hypothesized that light attenuation with
   depth would be correlated with predictable changes in gene expression in
   Lake Malawi, and that this variation would tune visual sensitivities to
   match the ambient light environment. We observed significant differences
   in cone opsin expression in three different comparisons among
   populations of the same species. Higher LWS expression was found in
   shallow versus deep Copadichromis eucinostomus. In Metriaclima zebra,
   individuals from Zimbawe Rock expressed significantly more SWS2B than
   those from Thumbi West Island, although these locales have similar
   ambient light environments. Finally, Tropheops gracilior from deeper
   water had significantly more variation in expression than their shallow
   counterparts. These results support that gene expression varies
   significantly between populations of the same species. Surprisingly,
   these results could not be explained by predicted visual performance as
   models predicted that differential expression patterns did not confer
   sensitivity advantages at different depths. This suggested that
   expression variation did not confer a local sensitivity advantage.
   Therefore, our findings were contrary to a primary requirement of the
   sensory bias hypothesis. As such, other explanations for intraspecific
   gene expression variation need to be tested.}},

Title = {{Species delimitation of common reef corals in the genus Pocillopora

Abstract = {{Stony corals in the genus Pocillopora are among the most common and
   widely distributed of Indo-Pacific corals and, as such, are often the
   subject of physiological and ecological research. In the far Tropical
   Eastern Pacific (TEP), they are major constituents of shallow coral
   communities, exhibiting considerable variability in colony shape and
   branch morphology and marked differences in response to thermal stress.
   Numerous intermediates occur between morphospecies that may relate to
   extensive hybridization. The diversity of the Pocillopora genus in the
   TEP was analysed genetically using nuclear ribosomal (ITS2) and
   mitochondrial (ORF) sequences, and population genetic markers (seven
   microsatellite loci). The resident dinoflagellate endosymbiont
   (Symbiodinium sp.) in each sample was also characterized using sequences
   of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and the noncoding
   region of the chloroplast psbA minicircle. From these analyses, three
   symbiotically distinct, reproductively isolated, nonhybridizing,
   evolutionarily divergent animal lineages were identified. Designated
   types 1, 2 and 3, these groupings were incongruent with traditional
   morphospecies classification. Type 1 was abundant and widespread
   throughout the TEP; type 2 was restricted to the Clipperton Atoll; and
   type 3 was found only in Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Each type
   harboured a different Symbiodinium'species lineage' in Clade C, and only
   type 1 associated with the `stress-tolerant'Symbiodinium glynni (D1).
   The accurate delineation of species and implementation of a proper
   taxonomy may profoundly improve our assessment of Pocillopora's
   reproductive biology, biogeographic distributions, and resilience to
   climate warming, information that must be considered when planning for
   the conservation of reef corals.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced species can threaten native taxa in multiple ways, including
   competition and hybridization, which can reduce fitness, alter
   ecological niches or swamp native genomes. Encroachment and
   hybridization by introduced species also provide opportunities to study
   the dynamics of invasiveness and hybridization during early stages
   following contact. We used 33 microsatellites, 51 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms and a mtDNA marker to characterize the extent and spatial
   pattern of encroachment and hybridization between a native, endemic
   subspecies of red fox (Vulpes vulpes patwin) and an introduced red fox
   population composed of highly admixed, phylogenetically divergent stock,
   resulting from a century of domestication. Both nuclear and mtDNA
   markers indicated that hybridization was primarily restricted to a
   narrow zone where the two populations came into contact. Although a few
   introgressed genotypes were detected in the interior of the native
   range, we found no immigrant foxes or F-1 or F-2 hybrids there,
   suggesting native foxes excluded introduced individuals. We speculate
   that the observed interbreeding at the periphery was facilitated by low
   densities. In total, 98\% of mtDNA haplotypes in the native range were
   native and 96\% of the nuclear ancestry was estimated to be native.
   Although the introduced range had expanded fivefold over the past four
   decades, native and non-native haplotypes from museum samples collected
   in and near the native range three decades earlier showed a similar
   geographic distribution as today, suggesting that the native range and
   hybrid zone were relatively stable. We hypothesize that the monogamous
   mating system of red foxes and other wild canids may enhance their
   resistance to hybridization because of greater fitness consequences
   associated with mate discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Natural hybrid zones provide opportunities to study a range of
   evolutionary phenomena from speciation to the genetic basis of
   fitness-related traits. We show that widespread hybridization has
   occurred between two neo-tropical stream fishes with partial
   reproductive isolation. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence
   data showed that the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni is
   monophyletic and that X. malinche is part of an independent monophyletic
   clade with other species. Using informative single nucleotide
   polymorphisms in one mitochondrial and three nuclear intron loci, we
   genotyped 776 specimens collected from twenty-three sites along seven
   separate stream reaches. Hybrid zones occurred in replicated fashion in
   all stream reaches along a gradient from high to low elevation.
   Genotyping revealed substantial variation in parental and hybrid
   frequencies among localities. Tests of F-IS and linkage disequilibrium
   (LD) revealed generally low F-IS and LD except in five populations where
   both parental species and hybrids were found suggesting incomplete
   reproductive isolation. In these locations, heterozygote deficiency and
   LD were high, which suggests either selection against early generation
   hybrids or assortative mating. These data lay the foundation to study
   the adaptive basis of the replicated hybrid zone structure and for
   future integration of behaviour and genetics to determine the processes
   that lead to the population genetic patterns observed in these hybrid
   zones.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{357-375}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One of the most widely distributed bats in the New World, the big brown
   bat (Eptesicus fuscus) exhibits well-documented geographic variation in
   morphology and life history traits, suggesting the potential for
   significant phylogeographic structure as well as adaptive
   differentiation among populations. In a pattern broadly consistent with
   morphologically defined subspecies, we found deeply divergent
   mitochondrial lineages restricted to different geographic regions. In
   contrast, sequence data from two nuclear loci suggest a general lack of
   regional genetic structure except for peripheral populations in the
   Caribbean and Mexico/South America. Coalescent analyses suggest that the
   striking difference in population structure between genomes cannot be
   attributed solely to different rates of lineage sorting, but is likely
   due to male-mediated gene flow homogenizing nuclear genetic diversity
   across most of the continental range. Despite this ongoing gene flow,
   selection has apparently been effective in producing and maintaining
   adaptive differentiation among populations, while strong female site
   fidelity, maintained over the course of millions of years, has produced
   remarkably deep divergence among geographically isolated matrilines. Our
   results highlight the importance of evaluating multiple genetic markers
   for a more complete understanding of population structure and history.}},

Abstract = {{Biogeographers claimed for more than a century that arctic plants
   survived glaciations in ice-free refugia within the limits of the North
   European ice sheets. Molecular studies have, however, provided
   overwhelming support for postglacial immigration into northern Europe,
   even from the west across the Atlantic. For the first time we can here
   present molecular evidence strongly favouring in situ glacial
   persistence of two species, the rare arctic-alpine pioneer species
   Sagina caespitosa and Arenaria humifusa. Both belong to the `west-arctic
   element' of amphi-Atlantic disjuncts, having their few and only European
   occurrences well within the limits of the last glaciation. Sequencing of
   non-coding regions of chloroplast DNA revealed only limited variation.
   However, two very distinct and partly diverse genetic groups, one East
   and one West Atlantic, were detected in each species based on amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), excluding postglacial dispersal
   from North America as explanation for their European occurrences.
   Patterns of genetic diversity and distinctiveness indicate that glacial
   populations existed in East Greenland and/or Svalbard (A. humifusa) and
   in southern Scandinavia (S. caespitosa). Despite their presumed lack of
   long-distance dispersal adaptations, intermixed populations in several
   regions indicate postglacial contact zones. Both species are declining
   in Nordic countries, probably due to climate change-induced habitat
   loss. Little or no current connectivity between their highly fragmented
   and partly distinct populations call for conservation of several
   populations in each geographic region.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{It has long been debated whether high alpine specialists survived ice
   ages in situ on small ice-free islands of habitat, so-called nunataks,
   or whether glacial survival was restricted to larger massifs de refuge
   at the periphery. We evaluate these alternative hypotheses in a local
   radiation of high alpine carabid beetles (genus Trechus) in the Orobian
   Alps, Northern Italy. While summits along the northern ridge of this
   mountain range were surrounded by the icesheet as nunataks during the
   last glacial maximum, southern areas remained unglaciated. We analyse a
   total of 1366 bp of mitochondrial (Cox1 and Cox2) data sampled from 150
   individuals from twelve populations and 530 bp of nuclear (PEPCK)
   sequence sampled for a subset of 30 individuals. Using Bayesian
   inference, we estimate ancestral location states in the gene trees,
   which in turn are used to infer the most likely order of recolonization
   under a model of sequential founder events from a massif de refuge from
   the mitochondrial data. We test for the paraphyly expected under this
   model and for reciprocal monophyly predicted by a contrasting model of
   prolonged persistence of nunatak populations. We find that (i) only
   three populations are incompatible with the paraphyly of the massif de
   refuge model, (ii) both mitochondrial and nuclear data support separate
   refugial origins for populations on the western and eastern ends of the
   northern ridge, and (iii) mitochondrial node ages suggest persistence on
   the northern ridge for part of the last ice age.}},

   adult male ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua)}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{409-419}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua) is the only coati species in which
   social groups contain an adult male year round, although most males live
   solitarily. We compared reproductive success of group living and
   solitary adult male coatis to determine the degree to which sociality
   affects reproductive success. Coati mating is highly seasonal and groups
   of female coatis come into oestrus during the same 1-2 week period.
   During the mating season, solitary adult males followed groups and
   fought with the group living male. This aggression was presumably to
   gain access to receptive females. We expected that high reproductive
   synchrony would make it difficult or impossible for the one group living
   male to monopolize and defend the group of oestrous females. However, we
   found that group living males sired between 67-91\% of the offspring in
   their groups. This reproductive monopolization is much higher than other
   species of mammals with comparably short mating seasons. Clearly, living
   in a group greatly enhanced a male's reproductive success. At the same
   time, at least 50\% of coati litters contained offspring sired by
   extra-group males (usually only one offspring per litter); thus,
   resident males could not prevent extra-group matings. The resident
   male's reproductive advantage may reflect female preference for a
   resident male strong enough to fend off competing males.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Altruism in social insects has evolved between closely related
   full-siblings. It is therefore of considerable interest why some groups
   have secondarily evolved low within-colony relatedness, which in turn
   affects the relatedness incentives of within-colony cooperation and
   conflict. The highest queen mating frequencies, and therefore among the
   lowest degrees of colony relatedness, occur in Apis honeybees and army
   ants of the subfamilies Aenictinae, Ecitoninae, and Dorylinae,
   suggesting that common life history features such as reproduction by
   colony fission and male biased numerical sex-ratios have convergently
   shaped these mating systems. Here we show that ponerine army ants of the
   genus Simopelta, which are distantly related but similar in general
   biology to other army ants, have strictly monandrous queens. Preliminary
   data suggest that workers reproduce in queenright colonies, which is in
   sharp contrast to other army ants. We hypothesize that differences in
   mature colony size and social complexity may explain these striking
   discrepancies.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen deposition is changing biodiversity on Earth. We need to
   understand the underlying mechanisms to conserve biodiversity better.
   Both selection and chance are potential mechanisms, and they may operate
   concurrently. Then, what are the respective effects of selection and
   chance, what is their relative importance and how do they change with
   increasing nitrogen deposition rate? Here, we performed a 6-year
   nitrogen addition experiment (0-28 g N/m2/year) in a typical steppe
   ecosystem of Inner Mongolia to investigate the community structure of
   plants, bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA). We developed an
   experimentally based calculation method to first separate the structural
   variations between plots into the effects of selection (S) and chance
   (C), and then calculate their relative importance. Our results showed
   that as nitrogen addition rate increased, S for both plants and bacteria
   increased, but C for plants first increased and then decreased, and C
   for bacteria also increased; meanwhile, both S and C for AOA changed
   nonlinearly. As nitrogen addition rate increased, the importance of
   chance decreased on the whole for all these communities, but it
   decreased nonlinearly for plants and bacteria, with a local increase at
   certain intermediate rates. At all treatments, the importance of chance
   was < 0.5 for plants, but > 0.5 for AOA. These results demonstrated that
   nitrogen deposition changed biodiversity by mediating the effects and
   importance of chance, implicating different strategies should be adopted
   in conserving biodiversity according to nitrogen deposition rate and
   community properties.}},
