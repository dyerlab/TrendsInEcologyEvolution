Abstract = {{One of the fundamental unknowns in the field of influenza biology is a
   panoramic understanding of the role wild birds play in the global
   maintenance and spread of influenza A viruses. Wild aquatic birds are
   considered a reservoir host for all lowly pathogenic avian influenza A
   viruses (AIV) and thus serve as a potential source of zoonotic AIV, such
   as Australasian-origin H5N1 responsible for morbidity and mortality in
   both poultry and humans, as well as genes that may contribute to the
   emergence of pandemic viruses. Years of broad, in-depth wild bird AIV
   surveillance have helped to decipher key observations and ideas
   regarding AIV evolution and viral ecology including the trending of
   viral lineages, patterns of gene flow within and between migratory
   flyways and the role of geographic boundaries in shaping viral evolution
   (Bahl etal. ; Lam etal. ). While these generally virus-centric studies
   have ultimately advanced our broader understanding of AIV dynamics,
   recent studies have been more host-focused, directed at determining the
   potential impact of host behaviour on AIV, specifically, the influence
   of bird migration upon AIV maintenance and transmission. A large number
   of surveillance studies have taken place in Alaska, United Statesa
   region where several global flyways overlapwith the aim of detecting the
   introduction of novel, Australasian-origin highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV
   into North America. By targeting bird species with known migration
   habits, long-distance migrators were determined to be involved in the
   intercontinental movement of individual AIV gene segments, but not
   entire viruses, between the Australasian and North American flyways
   (Koehler etal. ; Pearce etal. ). Yet, bird movement is not solely
   limited to long-distance migration, and the relationship of resident or
   nonmigratory and intermediate-distance migrant populations with AIV
   ecology has only recently been explored by Hill etal. () in this issue
   of Molecular Ecology. Applying a uniquely refined, multidimensional
   approach, Hill etal. validate the innovative use of stable isotope
   assays for qualifying migration status of wild mallards within the
   Pacific flyway. The authors reveal that AIV prevalence and diversity did
   not differ in wintering mallard ducks with different migration
   strategies, and while migrant mallards do indeed introduce AIV, these
   viruses do not circulate as the predominant viruses in resident birds.
   On the other hand, resident mallards from more temperate regions act as
   reservoirs, possibly contributing to the unseasonal circulation and
   extended transmission period of AIV. This study highlights the impact of
   animal behaviour on shaping viral evolution, and the unique observations
   made will help inform prospective AIV surveillance efforts in wild
   birds.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{5908-5910}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are getting cheaper and
   easier and hence becoming readily accessible for many researchers in
   biological disciplines including ecology. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Sudakaran etal. (2012) show how the NGS revolution contributes
   to our better and more comprehensive understanding of ecological
   interactions between gut symbiotic microbiota and the host organism.
   Using the European red firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus as a model system,
   they demonstrated that the gut microbiota consists of a small number of
   major bacterial phylotypes plus other minor bacterial associates. The
   major bacteria are localized in a specific anoxic section of the midgut
   and quantitatively account for most of the gut microbiota irrespective
   of host's geographic populations. The specific gut microbiota is
   established through early nymphal development of the host insect.
   Interestingly, the host feeding on different food, namely linden seeds,
   sunflower seeds or wasp larvae, scarcely affected the symbiont
   composition, suggesting homoeostatic control over the major symbiotic
   microbiota in the anoxic section of the midgut. Some of the minor
   components of the gut microbiota, which conventional
   PCR/cloning/sequencing approaches would have failed to detect, were
   convincingly shown to be food-derived. These findings rest on the robust
   basis of high-throughput sequencing data, and some of them could not be
   practically obtained by conventional molecular techniques, highlighting
   the significant impact of NGS approaches on ecological aspects of
   hostsymbiont interactions in a nonmodel organism.}},

Abstract = {{Despite much discussion of the importance of quantifying and reporting
   genotyping error in molecular studies, it is still not standard practice
   in the literature. This is particularly a concern for amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) studies, where differences in laboratory,
   peak-calling and locus-selection protocols can generate data sets
   varying widely in genotyping error rate, the number of loci used and
   potentially estimates of genetic diversity or differentiation. In our
   experience, papers rarely provide adequate information on AFLP
   reproducibility, making meaningful comparisons among studies difficult.
   To quantify the extent of this problem, we reviewed the current
   molecular ecology literature (470 recent AFLP articles) to determine the
   proportion of studies that report an error rate and follow established
   guidelines for assessing error. Fifty-four per cent of recent articles
   do not report any assessment of data set reproducibility. Of those
   studies that do claim to have assessed reproducibility, the majority
   (90\%) either do not report a specific error rate or do not provide
   sufficient details to allow the reader to judge whether error was
   assessed correctly. Even of the papers that do report an error rate and
   provide details, many (=23\%) do not follow recommended standards for
   quantifying error. These issues also exist for other marker types such
   as microsatellites, and next-generation sequencing techniques,
   particularly those which use restriction enzymes for fragment
   generation. Therefore, we urge all researchers conducting genotyping
   studies to estimate and more transparently report genotyping error using
   existing guidelines and encourage journals to enforce stricter standards
   for the publication of genotyping studies.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying historic patterns of population genetic diversity and
   connectivity is a primary challenge in efforts to re-establish the
   processes that have generated and maintained genetic variation across
   natural landscapes. The challenge of reconstructing pattern and process
   is even greater in highly altered landscapes where population
   extinctions and dramatic demographic fluctuations in remnant populations
   may have substantially altered, if not eliminated, historic patterns.
   Here, we seek to reconstruct historic patterns of diversity and
   connectivity in an endangered subspecies of woodrat that now occupies
   only 12 remnant locations within the highly altered landscape of the
   Great Central Valley of California. We examine patterns of diversity and
   connectivity using 14 microsatellite loci and sequence data from a
   mitochondrial locus and a nuclear intron. We reconstruct temporal change
   in habitat availability to establish several historical scenarios that
   could have led to contemporary patterns of diversity, and use an
   approximate Bayesian computation approach to test which of these
   scenarios is most consistent with our observed data. We find that the
   Central Valley populations harbour unique genetic variation coupled with
   a history of admixture between two well-differentiated species of
   woodrats that are currently restricted to the woodlands flanking the
   Valley. Our simulations also show that certain commonly used analytical
   approaches may fail to recover a history of admixture when populations
   experience severe bottlenecks subsequent to hybridization. Overall our
   study shows the strength of combining empirical and simulation analyses
   to recover the history of populations occupying highly altered
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern wolves have hybridized extensively with coyotes and gray wolves
   and are listed as a species of special concern in Canada. However, a
   distinct population of eastern wolves has been identified in Algonquin
   Provincial Park (APP) in Ontario. Previous studies of the diverse Canis
   hybrid zone adjacent to APP have not linked genetic analysis with field
   data to investigate genotype-specific morphology or determine how
   resident animals of different ancestry are distributed across the
   landscape in relation to heterogeneous environmental conditions.
   Accordingly, we studied resident wolves and coyotes in and adjacent to
   APP to identify distinct Canis types, clarify the extent of the APP
   eastern wolf population beyond the park boundaries and investigate
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure and landscapegenotype associations
   in the hybrid zone. We documented three genetically distinct Canis types
   within the APP region that also differed morphologically, corresponding
   to putative gray wolves, eastern wolves and coyotes. We also documented
   a substantial number of hybrid individuals (36\%) that were admixed
   between 2 or 3 of the Canis types. Breeding eastern wolves were less
   common outside of APP, but occurred in some unprotected areas where they
   were sympatric with a diverse combination of coyotes, gray wolves and
   hybrids. We found significant spatial genetic structure and identified a
   steep cline extending west from APP where the dominant genotype shifted
   abruptly from eastern wolves to coyotes and hybrids. The genotypic
   pattern to the south and northwest was a more complex mosaic of
   alternating genotypes. We modelled genetic ancestry in response to prey
   availability and human disturbance and found that individuals with
   greater wolf ancestry occupied areas of higher moose density and fewer
   roads. Our results clarify the structure of the Canis hybrid zone
   adjacent to APP and provide unique insight into environmental conditions
   influencing hybridization dynamics between wolves and coyotes.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have documented the impacts of habitat fragmentation on

   require urgent attention to better understand the impact of contemporary

   We show that individual mating patterns were increasingly impacted by
   lower conspecific density caused by habitat fragmentation. We determined
   that reduced pollen diversity probably has effects over and above those
   of inbreeding on progeny fitness. This provides an alternative
   mechanistic explanation for the indirect density dependence often

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation as a consequence of human activities is a
   worldwide phenomenon and one of the major threats to global
   biodiversity. Habitat loss and fragmentation is particularly a concern
   in the biodiverse tropics, where deforestation is occurring at
   unprecedented rates. Although insects are one of the most diverse and
   functionally important groups in tropical ecosystems, the quantitative
   effect of landscape features on their gene flow remains unknown. Here,
   we used a robust landscape genetics approach to quantify the effect of
   ten landscape features (deforestation, mature forests, other forest
   types, the River Chagres, streams, stream banks, roads, sea, lakes and
   swamps) and interactions between them, on the gene flow of a neotropical
   forest keystone species, the army ant Eciton burchellii. The influence
   of landscape on E.burchellii's gene flow reflected the different
   dispersal capability of its sexes; aerial for males and pedestrian for
   females, and the different depths of population history inferred from
   microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA. In contrast to the gene
   flow-facilitating effect of mature forests, deforested areas were found
   to be strong barriers for E.burchellii's gene flow. Other forest types
   were found to be gene flow facilitators but only when interacting with
   mature secondary forests, therefore indicating the importance of mature
   forests for the survival of E.burchelii and its associate species. The
   River Chagres was identified as a major historical gene flow barrier for
   E.burchellii, suggesting that an important loss of connectivity may
   occur because of large artificial waterways such as the Panama Canal.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of pathogen transmission typically overlook that wildlife hosts
   can include both migrant and resident populations when attempting to
   model circulation. Through the application of stable isotopes in flight
   feathers, we estimated the migration strategy of mallards (Anas
   platyrhynchos) occurring on California wintering grounds. Our study
   demonstrates that mallards- a principal host of avian influenza virus
   (AIV) in nature, contribute differently to virus gene flow depending on
   migration strategy. No difference in AIV prevalence was detected between
   resident (9.6\%), intermediate-distance (9.6\%) and long-distance
   migrants (7.4\%). Viral diversity among the three groups was also
   comparable, possibly owing to viral pool mixing when birds converge at
   wetlands during winter. However, migrants and residents contributed
   differently to the virus gene pool at wintering wetlands. Migrants
   introduced virus from northern breeding grounds (Alaska and the NW
   Pacific Rim) into the wintering population, facilitating gene flow at
   continental scales, but circulation of imported virus appeared to be
   limited. In contrast, resident mallards acted as AIV reservoirs
   facilitating year-round circulation of limited subtypes (i.e. H5N2) at
   lower latitudes. This study supports a model of virus exchange in
   temperate regions driven by the convergence of wild birds with separate
   geographic origins and exposure histories.}},

Abstract = {{The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis is a marine ectoparasite of
   wild and farmed salmon in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections of farmed
   salmon are of economic and ecological concern. Nauplius and copepodid
   salmon lice larvae are free-swimming and disperse in the water column
   until they encounter a host. In this study, we characterized the
   sublethal stress responses of L.salmonis copepodid larvae by applying a
   38K oligonucleotide microarray to profile transcriptomes following 24 h
   exposures to suboptimal salinity (3010 parts per thousand (parts per
   thousand)) or temperature (164 degrees C) environments. Hyposalinity
   exposure resulted in large-scale gene expression changes relative to
   those elicited by a thermal gradient. Subsequently, transcriptome
   responses to a more finely resolved salinity gradient between 30 parts
   per thousand and 25 parts per thousand were profiled. Minimal changes
   occurred at 29 parts per thousand or 28 parts per thousand, a threshold
   of response was identified at 27 parts per thousand, and the largest
   response was at 25 parts per thousand. Differentially expressed genes
   were clustered by pattern of expression, and clusters were characterized
   by functional enrichment analysis. Results indicate larval copepods
   adopt two distinct coping strategies in response to short-term
   hyposaline stress: a primary response using molecular chaperones and
   catabolic processes at 27 parts per thousand; and a secondary response
   up-regulating ion pumps, transporters, a different suite of chaperones
   and apoptosis-related transcripts at 26 parts per thousand and 25 parts
   per thousand. The results further our understanding of the tolerances of
   L.salmonis copepodids to salinity and temperature gradients and may
   assist in the development of salmon louse management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Species are generally described from morphological features, but there
   is growing recognition of sister forms that show substantial genetic
   differentiation without obvious morphological variation and may
   therefore be considered cryptic species. Here, we investigate the field
   vole (Microtus agrestis), a Eurasian mammal with little apparent
   morphological differentiation but which, on the basis of previous
   sex-linked nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses, is subdivided
   into a Northern and a Southern lineage, sufficiently divergent that they
   may represent two cryptic species. These earlier studies also provided
   limited evidence for two major mtDNA lineages within Iberia. In our
   present study, we extend these findings through a multilocus approach.
   We sampled 163 individuals from 46 localities, mainly in Iberia, and
   sequenced seven loci, maternally, paternally and biparentally inherited.
   Our results show that the mtDNA lineage identified in Portugal is indeed
   a distinct third lineage on the basis of other markers as well. In fact,
   multilocus coalescent-based methods clearly support three separate
   evolutionary units that may represent cryptic species: Northern,
   Southern and Portuguese. Divergence among these units was inferred to
   have occurred during the last glacial period; the Portuguese lineage
   split occurred first (estimated at c. 70 000 bp), and the Northern and
   Southern lineages separated at around the last glacial maximum
   (estimated at c. 18 500 bp). Such recent formation of evolutionary units
   that might be considered species has repercussions in terms of
   understanding evolutionary processes and the diversity of small mammals
   in a European context.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary climatic oscillations caused changes in sea level that
   altered the size, number and degree of isolation of islands,
   particularly in land-bridge archipelagoes. Elucidating the demographic
   effects of these oscillations increases our understanding of the role of
   climate change in shaping evolutionary processes in archipelagoes. The
   Puerto Rican Bank (PRB) (Puerto Rico and the Eastern Islands, which
   comprise Vieques, Culebra, the Virgin Islands and associated islets) in
   the eastern Caribbean Sea periodically coalesced during glaciations and
   fragmented during interglacial periods of the quaternary. To explore
   population-level consequences of sea level changes, we studied the
   phylogeography of the frog Eleutherodactylus antillensis across the
   archipelago. We tested hypotheses encompassing vicariance and dispersal
   narratives by sequencing mtDNA (c. 552 bp) of 285 individuals from 58
   localities, and four nuDNA introns (totalling c. 1633 bp) from 173 of
   these individuals. We found low support for a hypothesis of divergence
   of the Eastern Islands populations prior to the start of the penultimate
   interglacial c. 250 kya, and higher support for a hypothesis of
   colonization of the Eastern Islands from sources in eastern Puerto Rico
   during the penultimate and last glacial period, when a land bridge
   united the PRB. The Rio Grande de Loiza Basin in eastern Puerto Rico
   delineates a phylogeographic break. Haplotypes shared between the PRB
   and St. Croix (an island c. 105 km south-east of this archipelago)
   likely represent human-mediated introductions. Our findings illustrate
   how varying degrees of connectivity and isolation influence the
   evolution of tropical island organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous deep-sea species have apparent widespread and discontinuous
   distributions. Many of these are important foundation species,
   structuring hard-bottom benthic ecosystems. Theoretically, differences
   in the genetic composition of their populations vary geographically and
   with depth. Previous studies have examined the genetic diversity of some
   of these taxa in a regional context, suggesting that genetic
   differentiation does not occur at scales of discrete features such as
   seamounts or canyons, but at larger scales (e.g. ocean basins). However,
   to date, few studies have evaluated such diversity throughout the known
   distribution of a putative deep-sea species. We utilized sequences from
   seven mitochondrial gene regions and nuclear genetic variants of the
   deep-sea coral Paragorgia arborea in a phylogeographic context to
   examine the global patterns of genetic variation and their possible
   correlation with the spatial variables of geographic position and depth.
   We also examined the compatibility of this morphospecies with the
   genealogical-phylospecies concept by examining specimens collected
   worldwide. We show that the morphospecies P.arborea can be defined as a
   genealogical-phylospecies, in contrast to the hypothesis that P.arborea
   represents a cryptic species complex. Genetic variation is correlated
   with geographic location at the basin-scale level, but not with depth.
   Additionally, we present a phylogeographic hypothesis in which P.arborea
   originates from the North Pacific, followed by colonization of the
   Southern Hemisphere prior to migration to the North Atlantic. This
   hypothesis is consistent with the latest ocean circulation model for the
   Miocene.}},

Abstract = {{Patagonia was shaped by a complex geological history, including the
   Miocene uplift of the Andes, followed by volcanism, marine
   introgressions, and extreme climatic oscillations during
   PliocenePleistocene glaciationdeglaciation cycles. The distributional
   patterns and phylogenetic relationships of southern patagonian animals
   and plants were affected in different ways, and those imprints are
   reflected in the seven phylogeographic breaks and eight refugia that
   have been previously proposed. In this study, we estimated
   time-calibrated phylogenetic/phylogeographic patterns in lizards of the
   Liolaemus lineomaculatus group and relate them to historical
   Miocene-to-Pleistocene events of Patagonia and the previously proposed
   phylogeographic patterns. Individuals from 51 localities were sequenced
   for the mitochondrial marker (cyt-b) and a subsample of individuals from
   each mitochondrial lineage was sequenced for one nuclear (LDA12D) and
   one slow evolving mitochondrial gene (12S). Our analyses revealed strong
   phylogeographic structure among lineages and, in most cases, no signal
   of demographic changes through time. The lineomaculatus group is
   composed of three strongly supported clades (lineomaculatus, hatcheri
   and kolengh+silvanae), and divergence estimates suggested their origins
   associated with the oldest known Patagonian glaciation (75Ma);
   subsequent diversification within the lineomaculatus clade coincided
   with the large Pliocene glaciations (3.5Ma). The lineomaculatus clade
   includes nine strongly genetically and geographically structured
   lineages, five of which are interpreted as candidate species. Our
   findings suggest that some Liolaemus lineages have persisted in situ,
   each of them in a different refugium, through several
   glaciationdeglaciation cycles without demographic fluctuations. We also
   summarize and update qualitative evidence of some shared phylogeographic
   breaks and refugia among plants, rodents and lizards.}},

Abstract = {{Most invasive species established in Europe originate from either Asia
   or North America, but little is currently known about the potential of
   the Anatolian Peninsula (Asia Minor) and/or the Near East to constitute
   invasion sources. Mediterranean forests are generally fragile ecosystems
   that can be threatened by invasive organisms coming from different
   regions of the Mediterranean Basin, but for which historical data are
   difficult to gather and the phylogeographic patterns are still poorly
   understood for most terrestrial organisms. In this study, we
   characterized the genetic structure of Megastigmus schimitscheki, an
   invasive seed-feeding insect species originating from the Near East, and
   elucidated its invasion route in South-eastern France in the mid 1990s.
   To disentangle the evolutionary history of this introduction, we
   gathered samples from the main native regions (Taurus Mountains in
   Turkey, Lebanon and Cyprus) and from the invaded region that we
   genotyped using five microsatellite markers and for which we sequenced
   the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I gene. We applied a set of
   population genetic statistics and methods, including approximate
   Bayesian computation. We proposed a detailed phylogeographic pattern for
   the Near East populations, and we unambiguously showed that the French
   invasive populations originated from Cyprus, although the available
   historical data strongly suggested that Turkey could be the most
   plausible source area. Interestingly, we could show that the introduced
   populations were founded from an extremely restricted number of
   individuals that realized a host switch from Cedrus brevifolia to
   C.atlantica. Evolutionary hypotheses are discussed to account for this
   unlikely scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a study of the population genetic architecture and
   microevolution of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) at the
   environmental margins in the Middle East using mitochondrial sequences
   and nuclear microsatellites. In contrast to the rather homogenous
   population structure typical of cave-dwelling bats in climax tropical
   ecosystems, a relatively pronounced isolation by distance and population
   diversification was observed. The evolution of this pattern could be
   ascribed to the complicated demographic history at higher latitudes
   related to the range margin fragmentation and complex geomorphology of
   the studied area. Lineages from East Africa and Arabia show divergent
   positions. Within the northwestern unit, the most marked pattern of the
   microsatellite data set is connected with insularity, as demonstrated by
   the separate status of populations from Saharan oases and Cyprus. These
   demes also exhibit a reduction in genetic variability, which is
   presumably connected with founder effects, drift and other potential
   factors related to island evolution as site-specific selection. Genetic
   clustering indicates a semipermeability of the desert barriers in the
   Sahara and Arabian Peninsula and a corridor role of the Nile Valley. The
   results emphasize the role of the island environment in restricting the
   gene flow in megabats, which is also corroborated by biogeographic
   patterns within the family, and suggests the possibility of nascent
   island speciation on Cyprus. Demographic analyses suggest that the
   colonization of the region was connected to the spread of agricultural
   plants; therefore, the peripatric processes described above might be
   because of or strengthened by anthropogenic changes in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Although Pleistocene glaciations had a major impact on the population
   genetic patterns of many species in North America and Europe, it remains
   unclear how these climatic fluctuations contributed to species
   diversification in East Asia. One reason for this is the difficulty of
   distinguishing genetic admixture following secondary contact from
   incomplete lineage sorting, both of which can generate similar patterns
   of genetic variation. Using a combination of multilocus analyses and
   coalescent simulation, we explore how these two processes occurred in
   the Pleistocene evolutionary history of a widespread East Asian bird,
   the Vinous-throated parrotbill, Paradoxornis webbianus. Maximum
   likelihood (ML) tree identified two major mitochondrial lineages, which
   are geographically separated in most parts of its range, but are
   sympatric at a few sampling sites. NJ tree and Structure analysis of
   microsatellite data set revealed an extensive level of admixture and
   little population structure, suggesting recent admixture between two
   formerly separated groups. Networks from nuclear DNA data sets, however,
   did not indicate any geographically isolated groups but rather a
   panmictic population, thus support incomplete lineage sorting. By using
   coalescent simulation approaches, we show that both processes did occur,
   although at different temporal scales. During the Pleistocene
   glaciations, probably around 0.10.5Ma (the Marine Isotope Stage 6,
   MIS6), P.webbianus contracted into two separate refugia, and
   subsequently accumulated genetic divergence. During the interglacial
   MIS5, the species expanded into previously glaciated areas allowing the
   once separated groups to come into contact and become admixed. Taken
   together, our results indicate the current genetic variation within
   P.webbianus is a combination pattern of widespread distribution in
   pre-Pleistocene, then contraction and fragmentation into separated
   refugia during glacial advance, followed by recently postglacial
   expansion and admixture.}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic bacteria often play an essential nutritional role for insects,
   thereby allowing them to exploit novel food sources and expand into
   otherwise inaccessible ecological niches. Although many insects are
   inhabited by complex microbial communities, most studies on insect
   mutualists so far have focused on single endosymbionts and their
   interactions with the host. Here, we provide a comprehensive
   characterization of the gut microbiota of the red firebug (Pyrrhocoris
   apterus, Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae), a model organism for physiological
   and endocrinological research. A combination of several
   culture-independent techniques (454 pyrosequencing, quantitative PCR and
   cloning/sequencing) revealed a diverse community of likely transient
   bacterial taxa in the mid-gut regions M1, M2 and M4. However, the
   completely anoxic M3 region harboured a distinct microbiota consisting
   of facultative and obligate anaerobes including Actinobacteria
   (Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter sp.), Firmicutes
   (Clostri-dium sp. and Lactococcus lactis) and Proteobacteria (Klebsiella
   sp. and a previously undescribed Rickettsiales bacterium).
   Characterization of the M3 microbiota in different life stages of
   P.apterus indicated that the symbiotic bacterial community is vertically
   transmitted and becomes well defined between the second and third
   nymphal instar, which coincides with the initiation of feeding.
   Comparing the mid-gut M3 microbial communities of P.apterus individuals
   from five different populations and after feeding on three different

Abstract = {{Many herbivorous insects sequester defensive chemicals from their host
   plants. We tested sequestration fitness costs in the specialist moth
   Utetheisa ornatrix (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). We added pyrrolizidine
   alkaloids (PAs) to an artificial diet at different concentrations. Of
   all the larval and adult fitness components measured, only development
   time was negatively affected by PA concentration. These results were
   repeated under stressful laboratory conditions. On the other hand, the
   amount of PAs sequestered greatly increased with the diet PA
   concentration. Absence of a detectable negative effect does not
   necessarily imply a lack of costs if all individuals express the
   biochemical machinery of detoxification and sequestration
   constitutively. Therefore, we used qPCR to show that expression of the
   gene used to detoxify PAs, pyrrolizidine-alkaloid-N-oxygenase (pno),
   increased 41-fold in our highest PA treatment. Nevertheless, fitness
   components were affected only slightly or not at all, suggesting that
   sequestration in this species does not incur a strong cost. The apparent
   lack of costs has important implications for our understanding of the
   evolution of ecological interactions; for example, it implies that
   selection by specialist herbivores may decrease the levels of certain
   chemical defences in plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) community structure is
   limited by a lack of taxonomic resolution and autecological information.
   Rhizopogon vesiculosus and Rhizopogon vinicolor (Basidiomycota) are
   morphologically and genetically related species. They are dominant
   members of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) EMF
   communities, but mechanisms leading to their coexistence are unknown. We
   investigated the microsite associations and foraging strategy of
   individual R. vesiculosus and R. vinicolor genets. Mycelia spatial
   patterns, pervasiveness and root colonization patterns of fungal genets
   were compared between Rhizopogon species and between xeric and mesic
   soil moisture regimes. Rhizopogon spp. mycelia were systematically
   excavated from the soil and identified using microsatellite DNA markers.
   Rhizopogon vesiculosus mycelia occurred at greater depth, were more
   spatially pervasive, and colonized more tree roots than R. vinicolor
   mycelia. Both species were frequently encountered in organic layers and
   between the interface of organic and mineral horizons. They were
   particularly abundant within microsites associated with soil moisture
   retention. The occurrence of R. vesiculosus shifted in the presence of
   R. vinicolor towards mineral soil horizons, where R. vinicolor was
   mostly absent. This suggests that competition and foraging strategy may
   contribute towards the vertical partitioning observed between these
   species. Rhizopogon vesiculosus and R. vinicolor mycelia systems
   occurred at greater mean depths and were more pervasive in mesic plots
   compared with xeric plots. The spatial continuity and number of trees
   colonized by genets of each species did not significantly differ between
   soil moisture regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the scale of dispersal is an important consideration in
   the conservation and management of many species. However, in species in
   which the high-dispersal stage is characterized by tiny gametes or
   offspring, it may be difficult to estimate dispersal directly. This is
   the case for many marine species, whose pelagic larvae are dispersed by
   ocean currents by several days or weeks before beginning a benthic, more
   sedentary, adult stage. As consequence of the high-dispersal larval
   stage, many marine species have low genetic structure on large spatial
   scales (Waples ; Hellberg ). Despite the high capacity for dispersal,
   some tagging studies have found that a surprising number of larvae
   recruit into the population they were released from (self-recruitment).
   However, estimates of self-recruitment are not informative about mean
   dispersal between subpopulations. To what extent are limited dispersal
   estimates from tagging studies compatible with high potential for
   dispersal and low genetic structure? In this issue, a study on five
   species of coral reef fish used isolation by distance (IBD) between
   individuals to estimate mean dispersal distances (Puebla et al. ). They
   found that mean dispersal was unexpectedly small (<50 km), given
   relatively low IBD slopes and long pelagic durations. This study
   demonstrates how low genetic structure is compatible with limited
   dispersal in marine species. A comprehensive understanding of dispersal
   in marine species will involve integrating methods that estimate
   dispersal over different spatial and temporal scales. Genomic data may
   increase power to resolve these issues but must be applied carefully to
   this question.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{5640-5642}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Identifying landscape elements that influence gene flow and migration in
   wild species is the current main topic of landscape genetics. Most
   landscape genetic studies infer gene flow and migration from genetic
   distances among populations or individuals and statistically relate
   these measurements to landscape composition and configuration. This
   approach assumes symmetrical gene flow between pairs of populations.
   Such an assumption, however, will often be violated, especially in
   sourcesink systems. Source populations provide more emigrants than they
   receive immigrants, and sink populations get many immigrants, but
   release few emigrants. Sourcesink dynamics cannot be explored using
   common landscape genetic approaches relying on genetic distances. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Andreasen et al. () apply an
   alternative approach allowing them to infer asymmetrical migration. They
   use a Bayesian assignment test among objectively defined populations of
   mountain lions (Puma concolor) in western USA to estimate recent and
   directional migration rates. The study shows that an area with a high
   amount of wildlife refuges and low hunting pressure harbours a source
   population for mountain lion dispersal, while areas with high hunting
   pressures form sink populations; a result helpful in making informed
   decisions in conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical butterflies in the genus Heliconius have long been models in

Abstract = {{A key aim of evolutionary biology inferring the action of natural
   selection on wild species can be achieved by comparing neutral genetic
   differentiation between populations (F-ST) with quantitative genetic
   variation (Q(ST)). Each of the three possible outcomes of comparisons of
   QST and FST (Q(ST) > F-ST, Q(ST) = F-ST, Q(ST) < F-ST) is associated
   with an inference (diversifying selection, genetic drift, uniform
   selection, respectively). However, published empirical and theoretical
   studies have focused on the Q(ST) > F-ST outcome. We believe that this
   reflects the absence of a straightforward biological interpretation of
   the Q(ST) < F-ST pattern. We here report recent evidence of this
   neglected evolutionary pattern, provide guidelines to its interpretation
   as either a canalization phenomenon or a consequence of uniform

Abstract = {{Few species attract much more attention from the public and scientists
   than the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), a popular, enigmatic but
   highly endangered species. The application of molecular genetics to its
   biology and conservation has facilitated surprising insights into the
   biology of giant pandas as well as the effectiveness of conservation
   efforts during the past decades. Here, we review the history of genetic
   advances in this species, from phylogeny, demographical history, genetic
   variation, population structure, noninvasive population census and
   adaptive evolution to reveal to what extent the current status of the
   giant panda is a reflection of its evolutionary legacy, as opposed to
   the influence of anthropogenic factors that have negatively impacted
   this species. In addition, we summarize the conservation implications of
   these genetic findings applied for the management of this high-profile
   species. Finally, on the basis of these advances and predictable future
   changes in genetic technology, we discuss future research directions
   that seem promising for giant panda biology and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Marine biologists have gone through a paradigm shift, from the
   assumption that marine populations are largely open owing to extensive
   larval dispersal to the realization that marine dispersal is more
   restricted than previously thought. Yet, population genetic studies
   often reveal low levels of genetic structure across large geographic
   areas. On the other side, more direct approaches such as mark-recapture
   provide evidence of localized dispersal. To what extent can direct and
   indirect studies of marine dispersal be reconciled? One approach
   consists in applying genetic methods that have been validated with
   direct estimates of dispersal. Here, we use such an approachgenetic
   isolation by distance between individuals in continuous populationsto
   estimate the spatial scale of dispersal in five species of coral reef
   fish presenting low levels of genetic structure across the Caribbean.
   Individuals were sampled continuously along a 220-km transect following
   the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, population densities were estimated from
   surveys covering 17 200 m(2) of reef, and samples were genotyped at a
   total of 58 microsatellite loci. A small but positive
   isolation-by-distance slope was observed in the five species, providing
   mean parent-offspring dispersal estimates ranging between 7 and 42 km
   (CI 1113 km) and suggesting that there might be a correlation between
   minimum/maximum pelagic larval duration and dispersal in coral reef
   fishes. Coalescent-based simulations indicate that these results are
   robust to a variety of dispersal distributions and sampling designs. We
   conclude that low levels of genetic structure across large geographic
   areas are not necessarily indicative of extensive dispersal at
   ecological timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic boundaries have been shown to affect
   population dynamics and population structure for many species with
   movement patterns at the landscape level. Understanding population
   boundaries and movement rates in the field for species that are cryptic
   and occur at low densities is often extremely difficult and logistically
   prohibitive; however genetic techniques may offer insights that have
   previously been unattainable. We analysed thirteen microsatellite loci
   for 739 mountain lions (Puma concolor) using muscle tissue samples from
   individuals in the Great Basin throughout Nevada and the Sierra Nevada
   mountain range to test the hypothesis that heterogeneous hunting
   pressure results in source-sink dynamics at the landscape scale. We used
   a combination of non-spatial and spatial model-based Bayesian clustering
   methods to identify genetic populations. We then used a recently
   developed Bayesian multilocus genotyping method to estimate asymmetrical
   rates of contemporary movement between those subpopulations and to
   identify source and sink populations. We identified two populations at
   the highest level of genetic structuring with a total of five
   subpopulations in the Great Basin of Nevada and the Sierra Nevada range.
   Our results suggest that source-sink dynamics occur at landscape scales
   for wide-ranging species, such as mountain lions, and that source
   populations may be those that are under relatively less hunting pressure
   and that occupy refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Positive selection leaves characteristic footprints on DNA variation but
   detecting such patterns is challenging as the age, the intensity and the
   mode of selection as well as demography and evolutionary parameters
   (mutation and recombination rates) all play roles and these are
   difficult to disentangle. We recorded nucleotide variation in a sample
   of isogenic chromosomes from a western African population of Drosophila
   melanogaster at a locus (Fbp2) for which a partial selective sweep had
   previously been reported. We compared this locus to four other genes
   from the same chromosomes and from a European and an East African
   population. Then, we assessed Fbp2 variation in a sample of 370
   chromosomes covering a comprehensive geographic sampling of 16 African
   localities. The signature of selection was tested while accounting for
   the demographic history of the populations. We found a significant
   signal of selection in two West African localities including Ivory
   Coast. Variation at Fpb2 would thus represent a case of an ongoing
   selective sweep in the range of this species. A weaker, nonsignificant,
   signal of selection was, however, apparent in some other populations,
   thus leaving open several possibilities: (i) the selective sweep
   originated in Ivory Coast and has spread to the rest of the continent;
   (ii) several African populations report the signature of a selective
   event having occurred in an ancestral population; (iii) this genome
   region is subject to independent selective events in African
   populations; and (iv) A neutral scenario with population subdivision and
   local bottleneck cannot be fully excluded to explain the molecular
   patterns observed in some populations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the degree of genetic exchange between subspecies and
   populations is vital for the appropriate management of endangered
   species. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) have two recognized
   Southern Hemisphere subspecies that show differences in geographic
   distribution, morphology, vocalizations and genetics. During the austral
   summer feeding season, the Antarctic blue whale (B.m.intermedia) is
   found in polar waters and the pygmy blue whale (B. m. brevicauda) in
   temperate waters. Here, we genetically analyzed samples collected during
   the feeding season to report on several cases of hybridization between
   the two recognized blue whale Southern Hemisphere subspecies in a
   previously unconfirmed sympatric area off Antarctica. This means the
   pygmy blue whales using waters off Antarctica may migrate and then breed
   during the austral winter with the Antarctic subspecies. Alternatively,
   the subspecies may interbreed off Antarctica outside the expected
   austral winter breeding season. The genetically estimated recent
   migration rates from the pygmy to Antarctic subspecies were greater than
   estimates of evolutionary migration rates and previous estimates based
   on morphology of whaling catches. This discrepancy may be due to
   differences in the methods or an increase in the proportion of pygmy
   blue whales off Antarctica within the last four decades. Potential
   causes for the latter are whaling, anthropogenic climate change or a
   combination of these and may have led to hybridization between the
   subspecies. Our findings challenge the current knowledge about the
   breeding behaviour of the world's largest animal and provide key
   information that can be incorporated into management and conservation
   practices for this endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolutionary histories of invasive species is critical
   to adopt appropriate management strategies, but this process can be
   exceedingly complex to unravel. As illustrated in this study of the
   worldwide invasion of the woodwasp Sirex noctilio, population genetic
   analyses using coalescent-based scenario testing together with Bayesian
   clustering and historical records provide opportunities to address this
   problem. The pest spread from its native Eurasian range to the Southern
   Hemisphere in the 1900s and recently to Northern America, where it poses
   economic and potentially ecological threats to planted and native Pinus
   spp. To investigate the origins and pathways of invasion, samples from
   five continents were analysed using microsatellite and sequence data.
   The results of clustering analysis and scenario testing suggest that the
   invasion history is much more complex than previously believed, with
   most of the populations being admixtures resulting from independent
   introductions from Europe and subsequent spread among the invaded areas.
   Clustering analyses revealed two major source gene pools, one of which
   the scenario testing suggests is an as yet unsampled source. Results
   also shed light on the microevolutionary processes occurring during
   introductions, and showed that only few specimens gave rise to some of

Abstract = {{The accurate delimitation of evolutionary population units represents an
   important component in phylogeographic and conservation genetic studies.
   Here, we used a combined population assignment and historical
   demographic approach to study a complex of ecomorphologically
   distinctive populations of Black Salamanders (Aneides flavipunctatus)
   that are parapatrically distributed and meet at a three-way contact zone
   in north-western California. We used mitochondrial tree-based and
   multilocus clustering methods to evaluate a priori two- (Northern and
   Southern) and three (Northern, Coast and Inland) population hypotheses
   derived from previous studies. Mitochondrial results were consistent
   with the two- and three-population hypotheses, while the nDNA clustering
   results supported only the two-population hypothesis. Historical
   demographic analyses and mtDNA gene divergence estimates revealed that
   the Northern and Southern populations split during the Pliocene (25Ma).
   Subdivision of the Southern population into Coast and Inland populations
   was estimated to be late Pleistocene (0.24Ma), although our mtDNA
   results suggested a Pliocene divergence. Effective gene flow estimates
   (2N(e)m) suggest that either the two- or three-population hypotheses
   remain valid. However, our results unexpectedly revealed that the
   Northern population might instead represent two parapatric populations
   that separated nearly 4Ma. These results are surprising because the
   Pliocene divergence between these ecomorphologically conservative forms
   is similar or older than for the ecomorphologically divergent Coast and
   Inland sister populations. We conclude that Black Salamanders in
   north-western California belong to at least three or four populations or
   species, and these all meet criteria for being Evolutionary Significant
   Units or ESUs and therefore warrant conservation consideration.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic theory of morphological evolution postulates that form
   evolves largely by changing the expression proteins that are
   functionally conserved. It follows that understanding the function of
   proteins during different phases of development as well as the
   mechanisms by which the functions are modified is a prerequisite for
   understanding evolutionary change. Male pied flycatchers exhibit marked
   phenotypic variation in their breeding plumage. This variation has
   repeatedly been shown to have adaptive significance, but the molecular
   basis of this variation is not known. Here, we characterize the proteome
   of developing pied flycatcher feathers from differently pigmented males
   and also introduce a new method for examining the effect sizes of
   expression differences in protein interaction networks. Approximately
   300 proteins were identified in the developing feathers of males. Gene
   products associated with cellular transport, cell metabolism and protein
   synthesis formed a large part of the developing feather proteome.
   Sixty-five proteins associated with the development of the epidermis
   and/or pigmentation were detected in the data. The examination of
   expression level differences of proteinprotein interaction networks
   revealed an immunological signallingrelated network to exhibit
   significantly higher expression in black compared to brown males.
   Additionally, indications of differences in energy balance and oxidative
   stress related characteristics were detected. Together, these results
   provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary
   significance of plumage colour variation.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{5778-5794}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid zones are powerful natural systems to study evolutionary
   processes to gain an understanding of adaptation and speciation. In the
   Cauca Valley (Colombia), two butterfly races, Heliconius cydno cydnides
   and Heliconius cydno weymeri, meet and hybridize. We characterized this
   hybrid zone using a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences,
   amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), microsatellites and
   sequences for nuclear loci within and outside of the genomic regions
   that cause differences in wing colour pattern. The hybrid zone is
   largely composed of individuals of mixed ancestry. However, there is
   strong genetic discontinuity between the hybridizing races in mtDNA and,
   to a lesser extent, in all nuclear markers surveyed. The mtDNA
   clustering of H. c. cydnides with the H. cydno race from the Magdalena
   Valley and H. c. weymeri with the H. cydno race from the pacific coast
   suggests that H. c. cydnides colonized the Cauca Valley from the north,
   whereas H. c. weymeri did so by crossing the Andes in the southern part,
   implying a secondary contact origin. Colonization of the valley by H.
   cydno was accompanied by mimicry shift. Strong ecological isolation,
   driven by locally adaptive differences in mimetic wing patterns, is
   playing an important role in maintaining the hybrid zone. However,
   selection on wing pattern alone is not sufficient to explain the genetic
   discontinuity observed. There is evidence for differences in male mating
   preference, but the contribution of additional barriers needs further
   investigation. Overall, our results support the idea that speciation is
   a cumulative process, where the combination of multiple isolation
   barriers, combined with major phenotypic differences, facilitates
   population divergence in face of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons of a species' genetic diversity and divergence patterns
   across large connected populations vs. isolated relict areas provide
   important data for understanding potential response to global warming,
   habitat alterations and other perturbations. Aquatic taxa offer ideal
   case studies for interpreting these patterns, because their dispersal
   and gene flow often are constrained through narrow connectivity channels
   that have changed over geological time and/or from contemporary
   anthropogenic perturbations. Our research objective is to better
   understand the interplay between historic influences and modern-day
   factors (fishery exploitation, stocking supplementation and habitat
   loss) in shaping population genetic patterns of the yellow perch Perca
   flavescens (Percidae: Teleostei) across its native North American range.
   We employ a modified landscape genetics approach, analysing sequences
   from the entire mitochondrial DNA control region and 15 nuclear DNA
   microsatellite loci of 664 spawning adults from 24 populations. Results
   support that perch from primary glacial refugium areas (Missourian,
   Mississippian and Atlantic) founded contemporary northern populations.
   Genetic diversity today is highest in southern (never glaciated)
   populations and also is appreciable in northern areas that were founded
   from multiple refugia. Divergence is greater among isolated populations,
   both north and south; the southern Gulf Coast relict populations are the
   most divergent, reflecting their long history of isolation.
   Understanding the influence of past and current waterway connections on
   the genetic structure of yellow perch populations may help us to assess
   the roles of ongoing climate change and habitat disruptions towards
   conserving aquatic biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{In lichen symbiosis, fungal and algal partners form close associations,
   often codispersed by vegetative propagules. Due to the particular
   interdependence, processes such as colonization, dispersal or genetic
   drift are expected to result in congruent patterns of genetic structure
   in the symbionts. To study the population structure of an obligate
   symbiotic system in Europe, we genotyped the fungal and algal symbionts
   of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria at eight and seven
   microsatellite loci, respectively, and analysed about 4300 L. pulmonaria
   thalli from 142 populations from the species' European distribution
   range. Based on a centroid approach, which localizes centres of genetic
   differentiation with a high frequency of geographically restricted
   alleles, we identified the South ItalyBalkan region as the primary
   glacial refugial area of the lichen symbiosis. Procrustean rotation
   analysis and a distance congruence test between the fungal and algal
   population graphs indicated general concordance between the
   phylogeographies of the symbionts. The incongruent patterns found in
   areas of postglacial recolonization may show the presence of an
   additional refugial area for the fungal symbiont, and the impact that
   horizontal photobiont transmission and different mutation rates of the
   symbionts have on their genotypic associations at a continental scale.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated here the demographical history of Tabebuia impetiginosa
   (Bignoniaceae) to understand the dynamics of the disjunct geographical
   distribution of South American seasonally dry forests (SDFs), based on
   coupling an ensemble approach encompassing hindcasting species
   distribution modelling and statistical phylogeographical analysis. We
   sampled 17 populations (280 individuals) in central Brazil and analysed
   the polymorphisms at chloroplast (trnS-trnG, psbA-trnH, and ycf6-trnC
   intergenic spacers) and nuclear (ITS nrDNA) genomes. Phylogenetic
   analyses based on median-joining network showed no haplotype sharing
   among population but strong evidence of incomplete lineage sorting.
   Coalescent analyses showed historical constant populations size,
   negligible gene flow among populations, and an ancient time to most
   recent common ancestor dated from 4.7 +/- 1.1 Myr BP. Most divergences
   dated from the Lower Pleistocene, and no signal of important population
   size reduction was found in coalescent tree and tests of demographical
   expansion. Demographical scenarios were built based on past geographical
   range dynamic models, using two a priori biogeographical hypotheses
   (Pleistocene Arc and Amazonian SDF expansion) and on two additional
   hypotheses suggested by the palaeodistribution modelling built with
   several algorithms for distribution modelling and palaeoclimatic data.
   The simulation of these demographical scenarios showed that the pattern
   of diversity found so far for T. impetiginosa is in consonance with a
   palaeodistribution expansion during the last glacial maximum (LGM, 21
   kyr BP), strongly suggesting that the current disjunct distribution of
   T. impetiginosa in SDFs may represent a climatic relict of a once more
   wide distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Gene flow promotes genetic homogeneity of species in time and space.
   Gene flow can be modulated by sex-biased dispersal that links population
   genetics to mating systems. We investigated the phylogeography of the
   widely distributed Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus. This small
   shorebird has a large breeding range spanning from Western Europe to
   Japan and exhibits an unusually flexible mating system with high female
   breeding dispersal. We analysed genetic structure and gene flow using a
   427-bp fragment of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region, 21
   autosomal microsatellite markers and a Z microsatellite marker in 397
   unrelated individuals from 21 locations. We found no structure or
   isolation-by-distance over the continental range. However, island
   populations had low genetic diversity and were moderately differentiated
   from mainland locations. Genetic differentiation based on autosomal
   markers was positively correlated with distance between mainland and
   each island. Comparisons of uniparentally and biparentally inherited
   markers were consistent with female-biased gene flow. Maternally
   inherited mtDNA was less structured, whereas the Z-chromosomal marker
   was more structured than autosomal microsatellites. Adult males were
   more related than females within genetic clusters. Taken together, our
   results suggest a prominent role for polyandrous females in maintaining
   genetic homogeneity across large geographic distances.}},

Abstract = {{According to the inclusive fitness theory, some degree of positive
   relatedness is required for the evolution and maintenance of altruism.
   However, ant colonies are sometimes large interconnected networks of
   nests, which are genetically homogenous entities, causing a putative
   problem for the theory. We studied spatial structure and genetic
   relatedness in two supercolonies of the ant Formica exsecta, using
   nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We show that there may be multiple
   pathways to supercolonial social organization leading to different
   spatial genetic structures. One supercolony formed a genetically
   homogenous population dominated by a single mtDNA haplotype, as expected
   if founded by a small number of colonizers, followed by nest propagation
   by budding and domination of the habitat patch. The other supercolony
   had several haplotypes, and the spatial genetic structure was a mosaic
   of nuclear and mitochondrial clusters. Genetic diversity probably
   originated from long-range dispersal, and the mosaic population
   structure is likely a result of stochastic short-range dispersal of
   individuals. Such a mosaic spatial structure is apparently discordant
   with the current knowledge about the integrity of ant colonies.
   Relatedness was low in both populations when estimated among nestmates,
   but increased significantly when estimated among individuals sharing the
   same genetic cluster or haplogroup. The latter association indicates the
   important historical role of queen dispersal in the determination of the
   spatial genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Our study investigated the importance of variability in the parasitoid
   community as a source of selection on host group size using a field
   population of the tupelo leafminer, Antispila nysaefoliella Clemens,
   which specializes on tupelo, Nyssa sylvatica Marsh. Larvae were
   collected from leaves with variable numbers of larvae and screened for
   parasitism using polymerase chain reaction of mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase I using markers designed specifically for amplifying parasitoid
   DNA while excluding host DNA. This method of selective PCR was effective
   for detecting the presence and identifying species of immature stages of
   three hymenopteran superfamilies: Chalcidoidea, Ichneumonoidea and
   Platygastroidea, which represented 83.4\%, 16.0\% and 0.6\% of the total
   detectable parasitism, respectively. Our resulting sequences were then
   calibrated with sequences from identified adult parasitoids that had
   been either reared or field-captured. A cluster analysis revealed 10
   distinct clades that showed differences in attack patterns with respect
   to host traits and season. Total parasitism followed an inverse
   density-dependent or density-independent pattern with respect to host
   density (number per leaf). However, when parasitoid taxa were considered
   separately, one clade, which could be a cryptic species of Pnigalio
   maculipes Crawford (Chalcidoidea: Eulophidae), was found to increase its
   per leaf attack rate with host density. Our results suggest that
   parasitoid community composition and differences among species in their
   attack strategies can play a large role in determining the adaptive
   advantage of host grouping.}},

Abstract = {{Domesticated organisms demonstrate our capacity to influence wild
   species but also provide us with the opportunity to understand rapid
   evolution in the context of substantially altered environments and novel
   selective pressures. Recent advances in genetics and genomics have
   brought unprecedented insights into the domestication of many organisms
   and have opened new avenues for further improvements to be made. Yet,
   our ability to engineer biological systems is not without limits;
   genetic manipulation is often quite difficult. The budding yeast,
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not only one of the most powerful model
   organisms, but is also the premier producer of fermented foods and
   beverages around the globe. As a model system, it entertains a hefty
   workforce dedicated to deciphering its genome and the function it
   encodes at a rich mechanistic level. As a producer, it is used to make
   leavened bread, and dozens of different alcoholic beverages, such as
   beer and wine. Yet, applying the awesome power of yeast genetics to
   understanding its origins and evolution requires some knowledge of its
   wild ancestors and the environments from which they were derived. A
   number of surprisingly diverse lineages of S.cerevisiae from both
   primeval and secondary forests in China have been discovered by Wang and
   his colleagues. These lineages substantially expand our knowledge of
   wild yeast diversity and will be a boon to elucidating the ecology,
   evolution and domestication of this academic and industrial workhorse.}},

Abstract = {{Land is not the only barrier to dispersal encountered by marine
   organisms. For sedentary shallow water species, there is an additional,
   marine barrier, 5000km of uninterrupted deep-water stretch between the
   central and the eastern Pacific. This expanse of water, known as the
   Eastern Pacific Barrier, has been separating faunas of the two oceanic
   regions since the beginning of the Cenozoic. Species with larvae that
   cannot stay in the plankton for the time it takes to cross between the
   two sides have been evolving independently. That the eastern Pacific
   does not share species with the rest of the Pacific was obvious to
   naturalists two centuries ago (Darwin 1860). Yet, this rule has
   exceptions. A small minority of species are known to straddle the
   Eastern Pacific Barrier. One such exception is the scleractinian coral
   Porites lobata (Fig.1). This species is spread widely throughout the
   Indo-Pacific, where it is one of the major reef-builders, but it is also
   encountered in the eastern Pacific. Are eastern and central Pacific
   populations of this coral connected by gene flow? In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Baums etal.(2012) use microsatellite data to answer
   this question. They show that P.lobata populations in the eastern
   Pacific are cut off from genetic influx from the rest of the Pacific.
   Populations within each of the two oceanic regions are genetically
   connected (though those in the Hawaiian islands are also isolated).
   Significantly, the population in the Clipperton Atoll, the westernmost
   island in the eastern Pacific, genetically groups with populations from
   the central Pacific, suggesting that crossing the Eastern Pacific
   Barrier by P.lobata propagules does occasionally occur.}},

Abstract = {{Exactly 50years ago, a revolution in empirical population genetics began
   with the introduction of methods for detecting allelic variation using
   protein electrophoresis (Throckmorton 1962; Hubby 1963; Lewontin \&
   Hubby 1966). These pioneering scientists showed that populations are
   chock-full of genetic variation. This variation was a surprise that
   required a re-thinking of evolutionary genetic heuristics. Understanding
   the causes for the maintenance of this variation became and remains a
   major area of research. In the process of addressing the causes, this
   same group of scientists documented geographical genetic structure
   (Prakash etal. 1969), spawning the continued accumulation of what is now
   a huge case study catalogue of geographical differentiation (e.g.
   Loveless \& Hamrick 1984; Linhart \& Grant 1996). Geographical
   differentiation is clearly quite common. Yet, a truly general
   understanding of the patterns in and causes of spatial genetic structure
   across the genome remains elusive. To what extent is spatial structure
   driven by drift and phylogeography vs. geographical differences in
   environmental sources of selection? What proportion of the genome
   participates? A general understanding requires range-wide data on
   spatial patterning of variation across the entire genome. In this issue
   of Molecular Ecology, Lasky etal. (2012) make important strides towards
   addressing these issues, taking advantage of three contemporary
   revolutions in evolutionary biology. Two are technological:
   high-throughput sequencing and burgeoning computational power. One is
   cultural: open access to data from the community of scientists and
   especially data sets that result from large collaborative efforts.
   Together, these developments may at last put answers within reach.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic variation across a species range is an important factor in
   speciation and conservation, yet searching for general patterns and
   underlying causes remains challenging. While the majority of comparisons
   between central and marginal populations have revealed a general
   centralmarginal (CM) decline in genetic diversity, others show no clear
   pattern. Similarly, most latitudinal studies (although much fewer,
   especially those conducted rangewide) also showed latitudinal trends in
   genetic variation. To date, the CM and latitudinal patterns have often
   been examined independently and have rarely been considered together
   when accounting for the observed genetic variation across species
   ranges. Here, in the light of the most recent findings, I show how
   latitude might be responsible for some of the deviations from the
   general CM trends in genetic diversity, and vice versa. In the future,
   integrating latitude and range geometry with climate-induced species
   migration would offer important insights into conservation
   prioritization across species ranges.}},

Abstract = {{The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a leading system in
   genetics, genomics and molecular biology and is becoming a powerful tool
   to illuminate ecological and evolutionary principles. However, little is
   known of the ecology and population structure of this species in nature.
   Here, we present a field survey of this yeast at an unprecedented scale
   and have performed population genetics analysis of Chinese wild isolates
   with different ecological and geographical origins. We also included a
   set of worldwide isolates that represent the maximum genetic variation
   of S.cerevisiae documented so far. We clearly show that S.cerevisiae is
   a ubiquitous species in nature, occurring in highly diversified
   substrates from human-associated environments as well as habitats remote
   from human activity. Chinese isolates of S.cerevisiae exhibited strong
   population structure with nearly double the combined genetic variation
   of isolates from the rest of the world. We identified eight new distinct
   wild lineages (CHN IVIII) from a set of 99 characterized Chinese
   isolates. Isolates from primeval forests occur in ancient and
   significantly diverged basal lineages, while those from human-associated
   environments generally cluster in less differentiated domestic or mosaic
   groups. Basal lineages from primeval forests are usually inbred, exhibit
   lineage-specific karyotypes and are partially reproductively isolated.
   Our results suggest that greatly diverged populations of wild
   S.cerevisiae exist independently of and predate domesticated isolates.
   We find that China harbours a reservoir of natural genetic variation of
   S.cerevisiae and perhaps gives an indication of the origin of the
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The expanse of deep water between the central Pacific islands and the
   continental shelf of the Eastern Tropical Pacific is regarded as the
   world's most potent marine biogeographic barrier. During recurrent
   climatic fluctuations (ENSO, El Nino Southern Oscillation), however,
   changes in water temperature and the speed and direction of currents
   become favourable for trans-oceanic dispersal of larvae from central
   Pacific to marginal eastern Pacific reefs. Here, we investigate the
   population connectivity of the reef-building coral Porites lobata across
   the Eastern Pacific Barrier (EPB). Patterns of recent gene flow in
   samples (n=1173) from the central Pacific and the Eastern Tropical
   Pacific (ETP) were analysed with 12 microsatellite loci. Results
   indicated that P.lobata from the ETP are strongly isolated from those in
   the central Pacific and Hawaii (Fct ` =0.509; P<0.001). However, samples
   from Clipperton Atoll, an oceanic island on the eastern side of the EPB,
   grouped with the central Pacific. Within the central Pacific, Hawaiian
   populations were strongly isolated from three co-occurring clusters
   found throughout the remainder of the central Pacific. No further
   substructure was evident in the ETP. Changes in oceanographic conditions
   during ENSO over the past several thousand years thus appear
   insufficient to support larval deliveries from the central Pacific to
   the ETP or strong postsettlement selection acts on ETP settlers from the
   central Pacific. Recovery of P.lobata populations in the frequently
   disturbed ETP thus must depend on local larval sources.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Continuous progress in empirical population genetics based on the
   whole-genome polymorphism data requires the theoretical analysis of
   refined models in order to interpret the evolutionary history of
   populations with adequate accuracy. Recent studies focus prevalently on
   the aspects of demography and adaptation, whereas age structure (for
   example, in plants via the maintenance of seed banks) has attracted less
   attention. Germ banking, that is, seed or egg dormancy, is a prevalent
   and important life-history trait in plants and invertebrates, which
   buffers against environmental variability and modulates species
   extinction in fragmented habitats. Within this study, we investigate the
   combined effect of germ banking and time-varying population size on the
   neutral coalescent and particularly derive the allele frequency spectrum
   under some simplifying assumptions. We then perform an ABC analysis
   using two simple demographic scenariosa population expansion and an
   instantaneous decline. We demonstrate the appreciable influence of seed
   banks on the estimation of demographic parameters depending on the
   germination rate with biases scaled by the square of the germination
   rate. In the more complex case of a population bottleneck, which
   comprises an instantaneous decline and an expansion phase, ignoring
   information on the germination rate denies reliable estimates of the
   bottleneck parameters via the allelic spectrum. In particular, when
   seeds remain in the bank over several generations, recent expansions may
   remain invisible in the frequency spectrum, whereas ancient declines
   leave signatures much longer than in the absence of seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, alternative developmental pathways lead to the
   production of two distinct phenotypes, promoting the evolution of
   morphological novelty and diversification. Offspring type in marine
   invertebrates influences transport time by ocean currents, which dictate
   dispersal potential and gene flow, and thus has sweeping evolutionary
   effects on the potential for local adaptation and on rates of
   speciation, extinction and molecular evolution. Here, we use the
   polychaete Streblospio benedicti to investigate the effects of dimorphic
   offspring type on gene flow and genetic structure in coastal
   populations. We use 84 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for
   this species to assay populations on the East and West Coasts of the
   United States. Using these markers, we found that in their native East
   Coast distribution, populations of S.benedicti have high-population
   genetic structure, but this structure is associated primarily with
   geographic separation rather than developmental differences.
   Interestingly, very little genetic differentiation is recovered between
   individuals of different development types when they occur in the same
   or nearby populations, further supporting that this is a true case of
   poecilogony. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that the recently
   introduced (100ya) West Coast populations probably originated from a

Abstract = {{It is well accepted that the shape of the dispersal kernel, especially
   its tail, has a substantial effect on the genetic structure of species.
   Theory predicts that dispersal by fat-tailed kernels reshuffles genetic
   material, and thus, preserves genetic diversity during colonization.
   Moreover, if efficient long-distance dispersal is coupled with random
   colonization, an inverse isolation effect is predicted to develop in
   which increasing genetic diversity per colonizer is expected with
   increasing distance from a genetically variable source. By contrast,
   increasing isolation leads to decreasing genetic diversity when
   dispersal is via thin-tailed kernels. Here, we use a well-established
   model group for dispersal biology (peat mosses: genus Sphagnum) with a
   fat-tailed dispersal kernel, and the natural laboratory of the Stockholm
   archipelago to study the validity of the inverse isolation hypothesis in
   spore-dispersed plants in island colonization. Population genetic
   structure of three species (Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum fimbriatum and
   Sphagnum palustre) with contrasting life histories and ploidy levels
   were investigated on a set of islands using microsatellites. Our data
   show (phi(st)', amova, IBD) that dispersal of the two most abundant
   species can be well approximated by a random colonization model. We find
   that genetic diversity per colonizer on islands increases with distance
   from the mainland for S.fallax and S.fimbriatum. By contrast, S.palustre
   deviates from this pattern, owing to its restricted distribution in the
   region, affecting its source pool strength. Therefore, the inverse
   isolation effect appears to hold in natural populations of peat mosses
   and, likely, in other organisms with small diaspores.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions have been accelerated by a variety of human
   activities. Propagule pressure, the number of introduced individuals and
   independent introductions, is probably to be influenced by these human
   activities and may be an important factor for successful range expansion
   in new environments. We tested whether the current distribution of the
   predatory ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata in the introduced range
   (USA) is the result of multiple historical human introductions or
   natural range expansion from the first established populations in the
   USA. To test this hypothesis, we compared historical records of
   propagule size, propagule number, specific introduction locations and
   the date of each introduction, with estimates of genetic variation in
   mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome oxidase I). Our results indicated that
   genetic diversity in the introduced range was positively correlated with
   historical records of propagule size and number and negatively
   correlated with distance to nearest introduction point, suggesting that
   multiple human releases were successful. Higher genetic diversity in
   populations found near introduction points suggest that initial founder
   effects were limited, but lower genetic diversity found farther from
   introduction points is probably the result of serial founder effects
   during secondary range expansion. These results suggest that the current
   distribution of C.septempunctata in the introduced range is the result
   of a combination of human releases and short-range expansion from
   multiple established populations in the introduced range.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical trees often display long-distance pollen dispersal, even in
   highly fragmented landscapes. Understanding how patterns of spatial
   isolation influence pollen dispersal and interact with background
   patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) is critical for
   evaluating the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. In the
   endangered tropical timber tree Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae), we
   apply eleven microsatellite markers with paternity and parentage
   analysis to directly estimate historic gene flow and contemporary pollen
   dispersal across a large area (216km(2)) in a highly fragmented
   agro-forest landscape. A comparison of genetic diversity and genetic
   structure in adult and juvenile life stages indicates an increase in
   differentiation and FSGS over time. Paternity analysis and parentage
   analysis demonstrate high genetic connectivity across the landscape by
   pollen dispersal. A comparison between mother trees in forest patches
   with low and high densities of adult trees shows that the frequency of
   short-distance mating increases, as does average kinship among mates in
   low-density stands. This indicates that there are potentially negative
   genetic consequences of low population density associated with forest
   fragmentation. Single isolated trees, in contrast, frequently receive
   heterogeneous pollen from distances exceeding 5km. We discuss the
   processes leading to the observed patterns of pollen dispersal and the
   implications of this for conservation management of D.malabaricum and
   tropical trees more generally.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic basis and evolutionary implications of local adaptation in
   high gene flow marine organisms are still poorly understood. In several
   Mediterranean fish species, alternative migration patterns exist between
   individuals entering coastal lagoons that offer favourable conditions
   for growth and those staying in the sea where environmental conditions
   are less subject to rapid and stressful change. Whether these coexisting
   strategies are phenotypically plastic or include a role for local
   adaptation through differential survival needs to be determined. Here,
   we explore the genetic basis of alternate habitat use in western
   Mediterranean populations of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).
   Samples from lagoonal and open-sea habitats were typed for three
   candidate gene microsatellite loci, seven anonymous microsatellites and
   44 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for
   genotypeenvironment associations. While anonymous markers globally
   indicated high levels of gene flow across geographic locations and
   habitats, non-neutral differentiation patterns correlated with habitat
   type were found at two candidate microsatellite loci located in the
   promoter region of the growth hormone and prolactin genes. Further
   analysis of these two genes revealed that a mechanism based on habitat
   choice alone could not explain the distribution of genotype frequencies
   at a regional scale, thus implying a role for differential survival
   between habitats. We also found an association between allele size and
   habitat type, which, in the light of previous studies, suggests that
   polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region could influence gene
   expression by modulating transcription factor binding, thus providing a
   potential explanatory link between genotype and growth phenotype in
   nature.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis thaliana inhabits diverse climates and exhibits varied
   phenology across its range. Although A.thaliana is an extremely
   well-studied model species, the relationship between geography, growing
   season climate and its genetic variation is poorly characterized. We
   used redundancy analysis (RDA) to quantify the association of genomic
   variation {[}214 051 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] with
   geography and climate among 1003 accessions collected from 447 locations
   in Eurasia. We identified climate variables most correlated with genomic
   variation, which may be important selective gradients related to local
   adaptation across the species range. Climate variation among sites of
   origin explained slightly more genomic variation than geographical
   distance. Large-scale spatial gradients and early spring temperatures
   explained the most genomic variation, while growing season and summer
   conditions explained the most after controlling for spatial structure.
   SNP variation in Scandinavia showed the greatest climate structure among
   regions, possibly because of relatively consistent phenology and life
   history of populations in this region. Climate variation explained more
   variation among nonsynonymous SNPs than expected by chance, suggesting
   that much of the climatic structure of SNP correlations is due to
   changes in coding sequence that may underlie local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Climate is one of the most important drivers of local adaptation in
   forest tree species. Standing levels of genetic diversity and structure
   within and among natural populations of forest trees are determined by
   the interplay between climatic heterogeneity and the balance between
   selection and gene flow. To investigate this interplay, single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 24 to 37 populations
   from four subalpine conifers, Abies alba Mill., Larix decidua Mill.,
   Pinus cembra L. and Pinus mugo Turra, across their natural ranges in the
   Italian Alps and Apennines. Patterns of population structure were
   apparent using a Bayesian clustering program, STRUCTURE, which
   identified three to five genetic groups per species. Geographical
   correlates with these patterns, however, were only apparent for
   P.cembra. Multivariate environmental variables {[}i.e. principal
   components (PCs)] were subsequently tested for association with SNPs
   using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. The majority of the
   SNPs, ranging from six in L.decidua to 18 in P.mugo, were associated
   with PC1, corresponding to winter precipitation and seasonal minimum
   temperature. In A.alba, four SNPs were associated with PC2,
   corresponding to the seasonal minimum temperature. Functional annotation
   of those genes with the orthologs in Arabidopsis revealed several genes
   involved in abiotic stress response. This study provides a detailed
   assessment of population structure and its association with environment
   and geography in four coniferous species in the Italian mountains.}},

Abstract = {{Populations that maintain phenotypic divergence in sympatry typically
   show a mosaic pattern of genomic divergence, requiring a corresponding
   mosaic of genomic isolation (reduced gene flow). However, mechanisms
   that could produce the genomic isolation required for
   divergence-with-gene-flow have barely been explored, apart from the
   traditional localized effects of selection and reduced recombination
   near centromeres or inversions. By localizing FST outliers from a genome
   scan of wild pea aphid host races on a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)
   map of key traits, we test the hypothesis that between-population
   recombination and gene exchange are reduced over large divergence
   hitchhiking (DH) regions. As expected under divergence hitchhiking, our
   map confirms that QTL and divergent markers cluster together in multiple
   large genomic regions. Under divergence hitchhiking, the nonoutlier
   markers within these regions should show signs of reduced gene exchange
   relative to nonoutlier markers in genomic regions where ongoing gene
   flow is expected. We use this predicted difference among nonoutliers to
   perform a critical test of divergence hitchhiking. Results show that
   nonoutlier markers within clusters of FST outliers and QTL resolve the
   genetic population structure of the two host races nearly as well as the
   outliers themselves, while nonoutliers outside DH regions reveal no
   population structure, as expected if they experience more gene flow.
   These results provide clear evidence for divergence hitchhiking, a
   mechanism that may dramatically facilitate the process of
   speciation-with-gene-flow. They also show the power of integrating
   genome scans with genetic analyses of the phenotypic traits involved in
   local adaptation and population divergence.}},

Abstract = {{The arcticalpine Ranunculus glacialis s. l. is distributed in
   high-mountain ranges of temperate Europe and in the North, where it
   displays an extreme disjunction between the North Atlantic Arctic and
   Beringia. Based on comprehensive sampling and employing plastid and
   nuclear marker systems, we (i) test whether the European/Beringian
   disjunction correlates with the main evolutionary diversification, (ii)
   reconstruct the phylogeographic history in the Arctic and in temperate
   mountains and (iii) assess the susceptibility of arctic and mountain
   populations to climate change. Both data sets revealed several
   well-defined lineages, mostly with a coherent geographic distribution.
   The deepest evolutionary split did not coincide with the
   European/Beringian disjunction but occurred within the Alps. The
   Beringian lineage and North Atlantic Arctic populations, which reached
   their current distribution via rapid postglacial colonization, show
   connections to two divergent pools of Central European populations.
   Thus, immigration into the Arctic probably occurred at least twice. The
   presence of a rare cpDNA lineage related to Beringia in the Carpathians
   supports the role of these mountains as a stepping stone between
   temperate Europe and the non-European Arctic, and as an important area
   of high-mountain biodiversity. The temperate and arctic ranges presented
   contrasting phylogeographic histories: a largely static distribution in
   the former and rapid latitudinal spread in the latter. The persistence
   of ancient lineages with a strictly regional distribution suggests that
   the ability of R.glacialis to survive repeated climatic changes within
   southern mountain ranges is greater than what recently was predicted for
   alpine plants from climatic envelope modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands
   of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval
   dispersal distances are less than historically assumed. Gene flow across
   these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal
   among intermediate stepping-stone populations in combination with
   long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We
   evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a
   spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical
   Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate
   these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island
   archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live
   in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living
   in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways
   predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18
   tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among
   high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no
   difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In
   regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls
   only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between
   high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species.
   Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of
   isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our
   results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also
   see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or
   rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population
   genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes are usually believed to have cosmopolitan distributions.
   However, for estimating the global distributions of microorganisms,
   discriminating among cryptic species and eliminating undersampling
   biases are important challenges. We used a novel approach to address
   these problems and infer the global distribution of a given fungal
   ecological guild. We collected mushroom-forming fungi from Yakushima,
   Japan. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) from these
   samples and queried their sequences against GenBank. After identifying
   similar sequences, we tracked down the geographical origins of samples
   that yielded those sequences. We used Bayesian zero-inflated models to
   allow for species whose DNA sequences have not yet been deposited in
   GenBank. Results indicated that the geographical distribution of
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi was strongly constrained by host
   specificity, resulting in the occurrence of these fungi intensively in
   the neighbouring regions. On the other hand, saprotrophic (SAP) fungi
   were less constrained by climatic conditions, resulting in a much
   broader distribution range. We inferred that differences in constraints
   during colonization between ECM and SAP fungi were responsible for the
   different geographical distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the
   degree of host/habitat specificity and the degree of isolation of
   potentially suitable habitats determine microbial biogeographic
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding can lead to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles
   and to a subsequent fitness reduction. In Hymenoptera, deleterious
   alleles are purged in haploid males moderating inbreeding costs.
   However, in these haplodiploid species, inbreeding can result in the
   production of sterile diploid males. We investigated the effects of
   inbreeding on the individual and colony level in field colonies of the
   highly inbred ant Hypoponera opacior. In this species, outbreeding
   winged sexuals and nest-mating wingless sexuals mate during two separate
   reproductive periods. We show that regular sib-matings lead to high
   levels of homozygosity and the occasional production of diploid males,
   which sporadically sire triploid offspring. On the individual level,
   inbreeding was associated with an increased body size in workers. On the
   colony level, we found no evidence for inbreeding depression as
   productivity was unaffected by the level of homozygosity. Instead,
   inbred colonies altered their allocation strategies by investing more
   resources into sexuals than into workers. This shift towards sexual
   production was due to an increased investment in both males and queens,
   which was particularly pronounced in the dispersive generation. The
   absence of inbreeding depression combined with increased reproductive
   investment, especially in outbreeding sexuals, suggests that these ants
   have evolved active strategies to regulate the extent and effects of
   frequent inbreeding.}},

Abstract = {{Different organisms compensate for, and adapt to, environmental changes
   in different ways. In this way, environmental changes affect animalplant
   interactions. In this study, we assessed the effect of temperature on a
   tritrophic system of the lima bean, the herbivorous spider mite
   Tetranychus urticae and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. In
   this system, the plant defends itself against T.urticae by emitting
   volatiles that attract P.persimilis. Over 2040 degrees C, the emission
   of volatiles by infested plants and the subsequent attraction of
   P.persimilis peaked at 30 degrees C, but the number of eggs laid by
   T.urticae adults and the number of eggs consumed by P.persimilis peaked
   at 35 degrees C. This indicates that the spider mites and predatory
   mites performed best at a higher temperature than that at which most
   volatile attractants were produced. Our data from transcriptome
   pyrosequencing of the mites found that P.persimilis up-regulated gene
   families for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and ubiquitin-associated
   proteins, whereas T.urticae did not. RNA interference-mediated gene
   suppression in P.persimilis revealed differences in temperature
   responses. Predation on T.urticae eggs by P.persimilis that had been fed
   PpHsp70-1 dsRNA was low at 35 degrees C but not at 25 degrees C when
   PpHsp70-1 expression was very high. Overall, our molecular and
   behavioural approaches revealed that the mode and tolerance of lima
   bean, T.urticae and P.persimilis are distinctly affected by temperature
   variability, thereby making their tritrophic interactions temperature
   dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Imagine a single pathogen that is responsible for mass mortality of over
   a third of an entire vertebrate class. For example, if a single pathogen
   were causing the death, decline and extinction of 30\% of mammal species
   (including humans), the entire world would be paying attention. This is
   what has been happening to the world's amphibians the frogs, toads and
   salamanders that are affected by the chytrid fungal pathogen,
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (referred to as Bd), which are
   consequently declining at an alarming rate. It has aptly been described
   as the worst pathogen in history in terms of its effects on biodiversity
   (Kilpatrick etal. 2010). The pathogen was only formally described about
   13years ago (Longcore etal. 1999), and scientists are still in the
   process of determining where it came from and investigating the
   question: why now? Healthy debate has ensued as to whether Bd is a
   globally endemic organism that only recently started causing high
   mortality due to shifting host responses and/or environmental change
   (e.g. Pounds etal. 2006) or whether a virulent strain of the pathogen
   has rapidly disseminated around the world in recent decades, affecting
   new regions with a vengeance (e.g. Morehouse etal. 2003; Weldon etal.
   2004; Lips etal. 2008). We are finally beginning to shed more light on
   this question, due to significant discoveries that have emerged as a
   result of intensive DNA-sequencing methods comparing Bd isolates from
   different amphibian species across the globe. Evidence is mounting that
   there is indeed a global panzootic lineage of Bd (BdGPL) in addition to
   what appear to be more localized endemic strains (Fisher etal. 2009;
   James etal. 2009; Farrer etal. 2011). Additionally, BdGPL appears to be
   a hypervirulent strain that has resulted from the hybridization of
   different Bd strains that came into contact in recent decades, and is
   now potentially replacing the less-virulent endemic strains of the
   pathogen (Farrer etal. 2011). In a new study published in this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Schloegel etal. (2012) identify an additional unique
   Bd lineage that is endemic to the Atlantic Brazilian rainforests
   (Bd-Brazil) and provide striking evidence that the Bd-Brazil lineage has
   sexually recombined with the BdGPL lineage in an area where the two
   lineages likely came into contact as a result of classic
   anthropogenically mediated pathogen pollution(see below). Fungal
   pathogens, including Bd, have the propensity to form recombinant
   lineages when allopatric populations that have not yet formed genetic
   reproductive barriers are provided with opportunities to intermingle,
   and virulent strains may be selected for because they tend to be highly
   transmissible (Fisher etal. 2012). As Schloegel etal. (2012) point out,
   the demonstrated ability for Bd to undergo meiosis may also mean that it
   has the capacity to form a resistant spore stage (as yet undiscovered),
   based on extrapolation from other sexually reproducing chytrids that all
   have spore stages.}},

Abstract = {{The hunt for the genes underlying ecological speciation has now closed
   in on a number of candidates, but making the link from genotype to
   phenotype continues to pose a significant challenge. This is partly
   because genetic studies in many systems remain impeded by long
   generation times or an inability to perform controlled crosses. Now, in
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Malek etal. (2012) demonstrate the
   utility of a novel admixture mapping approach that can be used to
   identify genomic regions contributing to adaptive trait divergence
   between natural populations. Remarkably, they validate their approach by
   mapping traits associated with mate choice in a wild limnetic and
   benthic threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) species pair,
   finding several loci associated with male nuptial coloration and shape.
   While this study benefited from tried-and-true microsatellites in a
   well-characterized species with a detailed genetic map (and genome
   sequence), the field is quickly moving towards the use of
   next-generation sequencing, especially for nonmodel systems. The ability
   to characterize molecular polymorphisms for any system suggests that
   molecular ecologists working on virtually any species may benefit from
   applying Malek etal.'s approach, if naturally admixed populations are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Inferences of whole genome duplication (WGD) events accompany the
   annotation of every newly sequenced plant genome, but much remains
   unknown about the evolutionary processes and pathways relating to WGD
   (Soltis etal. 2010). What ecological, biogeographical and genetic
   factors cause WGD to occur in nature? How does WGD affect gene
   expression? How do genomes evolve after WGD? New species that have
   arisen recently through WGD are good places to seek answers to such
   questions. These could be relatively common in nature, but reliably
   demonstrating their recent origin requires documentary evidence, which
   can be very hard to come by. Thus far, records of species introductions
   and meticulous botanizing have demonstrated six new natural
   allopolyploids in just four genera: Tragopogon miscellus and T.mirus,
   Senecio cambrensis and S.eboracensis, Spartina anglica and Cardamine
   schultzii (Abbott \& Rieseberg 2012; Ainouche etal. 2009; Soltis \&
   Soltis 2009). It is risky to generalize about a universal feature of
   plant evolution from such a small sample; more examples are needed, in
   different genera. It is therefore of considerable interest that Mario
   Vallejo-Marin of University of Stirling has this year named a new
   allopolyploid species of monkey flower, Mimulus peregrinus, and
   presented evidence that it is <140years old (Vallejo-Marin 2012). This
   discovery is particularly timely as the monkey flower genus is
   developing rapidly as a model system for ecological genetics (Wu etal.
   2008), and in the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Jennifer
   Modliszewski and John Willis of Duke University present new data showing
   high genetic diversity in another recently discovered monkey flower
   allopolyploid, M.sookensis (Modliszewski \& Willis 2012).}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Global amphibian declines are linked with the presence of specific,
   highly virulent genotypes of the emerging fungal disease
   chytridiomycosis caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) known as
   the global panzootic lineage (Bd-GPL). The global trade in amphibians
   for human consumption is suspected to have facilitated emergence of the
   disease, but evidence to support this is largely lacking. Here, we
   investigated the role the Lithobates catesbeianus (North American
   bullfrog) trade in spreading Bd genotypes by comparing strains
   associated with L.catesbeianus to a global panel using 36 sequenced loci
   from multiple chromosomal regions. Most bullfrogs were infected with
   Bd-GPL genotypes, but we also detected novel, highly divergent Bd
   genotypes (Bd-Brazil) from a live bullfrog in a US market and from
   native Brazilian anurans in the Atlantic Forest where bullfrogs are
   widely farmed. Sexual reproduction was also detected for the first time
   in Bd in the form of a hybrid genotype between the Bd-GPL and Bd-Brazil
   lineages in the Atlantic Forest. Despite the demonstration that
   ribosomal RNA types in Bd fail to undergo concerted evolution (over 20
   sequence types may be found in a single strain), the Bd-GPL and
   Bd-Brazil lineages form largely separate clusters of related internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) RNA sequences. Using ITS sequences, we then
   demonstrate the presence of Bd-Brazil in Japan, primarily on invasive
   L.catesbeianus. The finding that Bd is capable of sexual reproduction
   between panzootic and endemic genotypes emphasizes the risk of
   international wildlife trade as a source of additional Bd epizootics
   owing to hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The grey wolves (Canis lupus) of Finland have had a varied history, with
   a period of rapid population expansion after the mid-1990s followed by a
   decline with a current census size of about 140 wolves. Here, we
   investigate the impact of unstable population size and connectivity on
   genetic diversity and structure in a long-term genetic study of 298
   Finnish wolves born in 19952009 and genotyped for 17 microsatellite
   loci. During the initial recovery and prior to population expansion,
   genetic diversity was high (19951997: LD-Ne=67.2; Ho=0.749; He=0.709)
   despite a small census size and low number of breeders (Nc<100; Nb<10)
   likely reflecting the status of the Russian source population.
   Surprisingly, observed heterozygosity decreased significantly during the
   study period (t=-2.643, P=0.021) despite population expansion, likely a
   result of an increase in inbreeding (FIS=0.108 in 20072009) owing to a
   low degree of connectivity with adjacent Russian wolf population
   (m=0.0160.090; FST=0.086, P<0.001) and population crash after 2006.
   However, population growth had a temporary positive impact on Ne and
   number of family lines. This study shows that even strong population
   growth alone might not be adequate to retain genetic diversity,
   especially when accompanied with low amount of subsequent gene flow and
   population decline.}},

Abstract = {{Many species are threatened with extinction and efforts are underway
   worldwide to restore imperilled species to their native ranges.
   Restoration requires knowledge of species' historical diversity and
   distribution. For some species, many populations were extirpated or
   individuals moved beyond their native range before native diversity and
   distribution were documented, resulting in a lack of accurate
   information for establishing restoration goals. Moreover, traditional
   taxonomic assessments often failed to accurately capture phylogenetic
   diversity. We illustrate a general approach for estimating regional
   native diversity and distribution for cutthroat trout in the Southern
   Rocky Mountains. We assembled a large archive of historical records
   documenting human-mediated change in the distribution of cutthroat trout
   (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and combined these data with phylogenetic
   analysis of 19th century samples from museums collected prior to trout
   stocking activities and contemporary DNA samples. Our study of the trout
   in the Southern Rocky Mountains uncovered six divergent lineages, two of
   which went extinct, probably in the early 20th century. A third lineage,
   previously declared extinct, was discovered surviving in a single stream
   outside of its native range. Comparison of the historical and modern
   distributions with stocking records revealed that the current
   distribution of trout largely reflects intensive stocking early in the
   late 19th and early 20th century from two phylogenetically and
   geographically distinct sources. Our documentation of recent
   extinctions, undescribed lineages, errors in taxonomy and dramatic range
   changes induced by human movement of fish underscores the importance of
   the historical record when developing and implementing conservation
   plans for threatened and endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{A leading hypothesis for the immense diversity of the Orchidaceae is
   that skewed mating success and small, disjunct populations lead to
   strong genetic drift and switches between adaptive peaks. This mechanism
   is only possible under conditions of low gene flow that lead to high
   genetic differentiation among populations. We tested whether orchids
   typically exhibit high levels of population genetic differentiation by
   conducting a meta-analysis to compare mean levels of population genetic
   differentiation (FST) between orchids and other diverse families and
   between rare and common orchids. Compared with other families, the
   Orchidaceae is typically characterized by relatively low genetic
   differentiation among populations (mean FST=0.146) at allozyme loci.
   Rare terrestrial orchids showed higher population genetic
   differentiation than common orchids, although this value was still lower
   than the mean for most plant families. All lines of evidence suggest
   that orchids are typically characterized by low levels of population
   genetic differentiation, even in species with naturally disjunct
   populations. As such, we found no strong evidence that genetic drift in
   isolated populations has played a major role in the diversification of
   the Orchidaceae. Further research into the diversification of the family
   needs to unravel the relative roles of biotic and environmental
   selective pressures in the speciation of orchids.}},

Pages = {{5221-5235}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Asexual reproduction is particularly common among introduced species,
   probably because it helps to overcome the negative effects associated
   with low population densities during colonization. The ant Cerapachys
   biroi has been introduced to tropical and subtropical islands around the
   world since the beginning of the last century. In this species, workers
   can reproduce via thelytokous parthenogenesis. Here, we use genetic
   markers to reconstruct the history of anthropogenic introductions of
   C.biroi, and to address the prevalence of female parthenogenesis in
   introduced and native populations. We show that at least four
   genetically distinct lineages have been introduced from continental Asia
   and have led to the species' circumtropical establishment. Our analyses
   demonstrate that asexual reproduction dominates in the introduced range
   and is also common in the native range. Given that C.biroi is the only
   dorylomorph ant that has successfully become established outside of its
   native range, this unusual mode of reproduction probably facilitated the
   species' worldwide spread. On the other hand, the rare occurrence of
   haploid males and at least one clear case of sexual recombination in the
   introduced range show that C.biroi has not lost the potential for sex.
   Finally, we show that thelytoky in C.biroi probably has a genetic rather
   than an infectious origin, and that automixis with central fusion is the
   most likely underlying cytological mechanism. This is in accordance with
   what is known for other thelytokous eusocial Hymenoptera.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While supportive breeding programmes strive to minimize negative genetic
   impacts to populations, case studies have found evidence for reduced
   fitness of artificially produced individuals when they reproduce in the
   wild. Pedigrees of two complete generations were tracked with molecular
   markers to investigate differences in reproductive success (RS) of wild
   and hatchery-reared Chinook salmon spawning in the natural environment
   to address questions regarding the demographic and genetic impacts of
   supplementation to a natural population. Results show a demographic
   boost to the population from supplementation. On average, fish taken
   into the hatchery produced 4.7 times more adult offspring, and 1.3 times
   more adult grand-offspring than naturally reproducing fish. Of the wild
   and hatchery fish that successfully reproduced, we found no significant
   differences in RS between any comparisons, but hatchery-reared males
   typically had lower RS values than wild males. Mean relative
   reproductive success (RRS) for hatchery F1 females and males was 1.11
   (P=0.84) and 0.89 (P=0.56), respectively. RRS of hatchery-reared fish
   (H) that mated in the wild with either hatchery or wild-origin (W) fish
   was generally equivalent to WxW matings. Mean RRS of HxW and HxH matings
   was 1.07 (P=0.92) and 0.94 (P=0.95), respectively. We conclude that fish
   chosen for hatchery rearing did not have a detectable negative impact on
   the fitness of wild fish by mating with them for a single generation.
   Results suggest that supplementation following similar management
   practices (e.g. 100\% local, wild-origin brood stock) can successfully
   boost population size with minimal impacts on the fitness of salmon in
   the wild.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal in evolutionary biology is to uncover the genetic basis of
   adaptation. Divergent selection exerted on ecological traits may result
   in adaptive population differentiation and reproductive isolation and
   affect differentially the level of genetic divergence along the genome.
   Genome-wide scan of large sets of individuals from multiple populations
   is a powerful approach to identify loci or genomic regions under
   ecologically divergent selection. Here, we focused on the pea aphid, a
   species complex of divergent host races, to explore the organization of
   the genomic divergence associated with host plant adaptation and
   ecological speciation. We analysed 390 microsatellite markers located at
   variable distances from predicted genes in replicate samples of
   sympatric populations of the pea aphid collected on alfalfa, red clover
   and pea, which correspond to three common host-adapted races reported in
   this species complex. Using a method that accounts for the hierarchical
   structure of our data set, we found a set of 11 outlier loci that show
   higher genetic differentiation between host races than expected under
   the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Two of the outliers are close
   to olfactory receptor genes and three other nearby genes encoding
   salivary proteins. The remaining outliers are located in regions with
   genes of unknown functions, or which functions are unlikely to be
   involved in interactions with the host plant. This study reveals genetic
   signatures of divergent selection across the genome and provides an
   inventory of candidate genes responsible for plant specialization in the
   pea aphid, thereby setting the stage for future functional studies.}},

Title = {{Admixture mapping of male nuptial colour and body shape in a recently

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress, we still know relatively little about the
   genetic architecture that underlies adaptation to divergent
   environments. Determining whether the genetic architecture of phenotypic
   adaptation follows any predictable patterns requires data from a wide
   variety of species. However, in many organisms, genetic studies are
   hindered by the inability to perform genetic crosses in the laboratory
   or by long generation times. Admixture mapping is an approach that
   circumvents these issues by taking advantage of hybridization that
   occurs between populations or species in the wild. Here, we demonstrate
   the utility of admixture mapping in a naturally occurring hybrid
   population of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from Enos
   Lake, British Columbia. Until recently, this lake contained two species
   of sticklebacks adapted to divergent habitats within the lake. This
   benthiclimnetic species pair diverged in a number of phenotypes,
   including male nuptial coloration and body shape, which were previously
   shown to contribute to reproductive isolation between them. However,
   recent ecological disturbance has contributed to extensive hybridization
   between the species, and there is now a single, admixed population
   within Enos Lake. We collected over 500 males from Enos Lake and found
   that most had intermediate nuptial colour and body shape. By genotyping
   males with nuptial colour at the two extremes of the phenotypic
   distribution, we identified seven genomic regions on three chromosomes
   associated with divergence in male nuptial colour. These genomic regions
   are also associated with variation in body shape, suggesting that tight
   linkage and/or pleiotropy facilitated adaptation to divergent
   environments in benthiclimnetic species pairs.}},

   allotetraploid derivative of Mimulus guttatus and M.nasutus, Mimulus
   sookensis, is found throughout the valleys of western Oregon and
   Vancouver Island. Here, we analyse the patterns of nucleotide diversity
   at three chloroplast and six nuclear loci in M.guttatus, M.nasutus and
   M.sookensis, to gain insight into the formation of M.sookensis. By
   analysing the patterns of genetic variation seen in the diploid
   progenitors in comparison with the variation seen in M.sookensis, we are
   able to show that M.sookensis has recurrently formed. We also observed
   that most M.sookensis individuals are fixed heterozygotes at all of the
   nuclear loci examined, suggesting that duplicate gene loss is not
   extensive in M.sookensis. To assess the possibility that hybridization
   among M.sookensis has contributed to genetic diversity, we conducted
   crossing experiments within M.sookensis. We found that M.sookensis of
   independent origin are highly interfertile, suggesting that crossing
   barriers do not exist within M.sookensis, and that hybridization among
   M.sookensis may result in new recombinant genotypes. Together, the data
   suggest that although recurrent origins may be common, they can
   contribute to genetic diversity without contributing to reproductive
   isolation among independently arisen polyploid lineages.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate extensive quantitative trait variation (dewlap hue,
   colour pattern, dorsum hue, body proportions and scalation) in the
   Martinique anole across eight transects representing nascent parapatric
   ecological speciation, nascent allopatric speciation and allopatric
   divergence without sufficient genetic structure to suggest speciation.
   Quantitative trait divergence can be extremely large between adjacent
   sets of populations, but with one exception that this is associated with
   difference in habitat rather than past allopatry. Nascent ecological
   speciation shows the greatest level of quantitative trait divergence
   across all character sets including those implicated in natural, as well
   as sexual selection. The sole example of nascent allopatric speciation
   is associated with fairly strong quantitative trait divergence among
   most character sets, but not the set most implicated in natural (rather
   than sexual) selection. The role of sexual selection in ecological
   speciation is discussed, both in terms of female choice with assortative
   mating and malemale competition with condition-dependant sexual signals.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{5309-5323}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The completion of speciation is typically difficult to ascertain in
   rapidly diverging taxa but the amount of hybridization and gene flow in
   sympatry or parapatry contains important information about the level of
   reproductive isolation achieved. Here, we examined the progress in
   speciation between the Mediterranean (Microtus duodecimcostatus) and the
   Lusitanian pine vole (M.lusitanicus), which are part of the most rapid
   radiation of species known in mammals. These two Iberian pine voles are
   classified as separate species because of differences in morphology and
   ecology, but relatively many ambiguous individuals can be found in
   sympatric conditions. Our phylogenetic analyses of rangewide data from
   the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtDNA) demonstrated high levels of
   diversity and a basal separation in two parapatric lineages. However,
   mtDNA affiliation was at odds with morphological classification or
   geographical distribution of the taxa. In contrast, statistical analyses
   of microsatellites (nucDNA) showed two clear genetic clusters in
   allopatry and sympatry generally matching morphological classification.
   This cytonuclear discordance over a large geographic area suggests
   historical introgression of mtDNA from M.duodecimcostatus to
   M.lusitanicus. There was statistical evidence for at least two recent
   hybrids in the sympatry zone but gene flow is apparently low given
   clear-cut differences in nucDNA. Our results indicate a relatively
   advanced speciation process in these Iberian pine voles without fully
   established reproductive isolation. This situation enables use of
   combined population genomic and experimental approaches for the
   separation of patterns and mechanisms in the ongoing explosive
   diversification of these and other Arvicoline rodents in the future.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{How frequently genes pass through a hybrid zone may be influenced by the
   environment. Accordingly, in long hybrid zones that span more than one
   environmental setting, different patterns may emerge. The varied
   conditions allow testing of hypotheses on dispersal as a function of the
   environment. We reconstruct the amount and direction of gene flow across
   a heterogeneous hybrid zone of two species of marbled newts (Triturus
   marmoratus and Triturus pygmaeus), in four widely separated areas of the
   Iberian Peninsula from one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. The
   main variables associated with the position of the contact zone are
   precipitation, rivers, altitude and relief. In some sections of the
   contact zone, however, its position is not correlated with any
   environmental factor and is instead determined by the shortest
   geographical distance between fixed positions at either side (mountains
   in the East and river in the West). In areas where the position of the
   zone is stable, gene flow was bidirectional. External data show that
   T.pygmaeus has superseded T.marmoratus over a large area and here gene
   flow was unidirectional. The prediction that a major river would reduce
   gene flow was not confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Nannopus palustris Brady, 1880is a free-living widely distributed
   harpacticoid copepod, which has been formerly assumed to be a single,
   cosmopolitan but highly variable species. We compared several
   geographically distant N.palustris populations in terms of their
   morphology and genetics. Populations from the White Sea (WS), the North
   Sea (NS), the Black Sea (BS) and two sympatric morphs from South
   Carolina, USA (SC notched and SC straight morphs), were considered. The
   NS, BS and to a lesser extent SC notched specimens were morphologically
   similar and partly coincided to the canonical description of the
   species. By contrast, WS population showed remarkable anatomical and
   morphometric peculiarities that correspond to some earlier descriptions.
   Genetic analyses of mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear (28S rDNA)
   genes demonstrated the significant distinctness among WS, both SC and
   (NS+BS) populations, the latter two being genetically indistinguishable.
   Concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees and
   morphological data supports that N.palustris is in fact composed of
   several pseudo-sibling species, which are genetically and
   morphologically divergent. Neither correlation between genetic
   divergence and geographical distance nor significant intrapopulation
   diversity was found for these species. Taxonomic status, distribution
   and phylogenetic relationships of the species within the Nannopus genus
   need to be reconsidered. A further subdivision of species complexes
   might have important implications for the analysis of biodiversity of
   benthic copepods and consequently for the interpretation of their
   (species-specific) ecological function.}},

Abstract = {{The relatedness structure of animal populations is thought to be a
   critically important factor underlying the evolution of mating systems
   and social behaviours. While previous work has shown that population
   structure is shaped by many biological processes, few studies have
   investigated how these factors vary over time. Consequently, we explored
   the fine-scale spatiotemporal genetic structure of an intensively
   studied population of cooperatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos
   mungo) over a 10-year period. Overall population structure was strong
   (average FST=0.129) but groups with spatially overlapping territories
   were not more genetically similar to one another than noncontiguous
   groups. Instead, genetic differentiation was associated with historical
   group-fission (budding) events, with new groups diverging from their
   parent groups over time. Within groups, relatedness was high within but
   not between the sexes, although the latter increased over time since
   group formation due to group founders being replaced by philopatric
   young. This trend was not mirrored by a decrease in average offspring
   heterozygosity over time, suggesting that close inbreeding may often be
   avoided, even when immigration into established groups is virtually
   absent and opportunities for extra-group matings are rare. Fine-scale
   spatiotemporal population structure could have important implications in
   social species, where relatedness between interacting individuals is a
   vital component in the evolution of patterns of inbreeding avoidance,
   reproductive skew and kin-selected helping and harming.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the spatial distribution of relatives in a population under
   contrasted environmental conditions provides critical insights into the
   flexibility of dispersal behaviour and the role of environmental
   conditions in shaping population relatedness and social structure. Yet
   few studies have evaluated the effects of fluctuating environmental
   conditions on relatedness structure of solitary species in the wild. The
   aim of this study was to determine the impact of interannual variations
   in environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of relatives
   {[}spatial genetic structure (SGS)] and dispersal patterns of a wild
   population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), a solitary rodent of
   North America. Eastern chipmunks depend on the seed of masting trees for
   reproduction and survival. Here, we combined the analysis of the SGS of
   adults with direct estimates of juvenile dispersal distance during six
   contrasted years with different dispersal seasons, population sizes and
   seed production. We found that environmental conditions influences the
   dispersal distances of juveniles and that male juveniles dispersed
   farther than females. The extent of the SGS of adult females varied
   between years and matched the variation in environmental conditions. In
   contrast, the SGS of males did not vary between years. We also found a
   difference in SGS between males and females that was consistent with
   male-biased dispersal. This study suggests that both the dispersal
   behaviour and the relatedness structure in a population of a solitary
   species can be relatively labile and change according to environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology and geographical distribution of disease vectors are major
   determinants of spatial and temporal variations in the transmission
   dynamics of vector-borne pathogens. However, there are limited studies
   on the ecology of vectors that contribute to the natural transmission of
   most vector-borne pathogens. Avian Plasmodium parasites are multihost
   mosquito-borne pathogens transmitted by multiple mosquito species, which
   might regulate the diversity and persistence of these parasites. From
   2007 to 2010, we conducted entomological surveys at Sakata wetland in
   central Japan, to investigate temporal variation in mosquito occurrence
   and prevalence of avian Plasmodium lineages in the mosquito populations.
   A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method was used to detect
   Plasmodium parasites and identify the blood sources of mosquitoes. Culex
   inatomii and C.pipiens pallens represented 60.0\% and 34.8\% of 11
   mosquito species collected, respectively. Our results showed that the
   two dominant mosquito species most likely serve as principal vectors of
   avian Plasmodium parasites during June, which coincides with the
   breeding season of bird species nesting in the wetland reed beds.
   Fourteen animal species were identified as blood sources of mosquitoes,
   with the oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis) being the
   commonest blood source. Although there was significant temporal
   variation in the occurrence of mosquitoes and prevalence of Plasmodium
   lineages in the mosquitoes, the dominant Plasmodium lineages shared by
   the two dominant mosquito species were consistently found at the same
   time during transmission seasons. Because vector competence cannot be
   confirmed solely by PCR approaches, experimental demonstration is
   required to provide definitive evidence of transmission suggested in
   this study.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic underpinnings of adaptive change is a
   fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology.
   Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect that has spread
   to temperate regions and become cosmopolitan, offers a powerful
   opportunity for identifying the molecular polymorphisms underlying
   clinal adaptation. Here, we use genome-wide next-generation sequencing
   of DNA pools ('pool-seq') from three populations collected along the
   North American east coast to examine patterns of latitudinal
   differentiation. Comparing the genomes of these populations is
   particularly interesting since they exhibit clinal variation in a number
   of important life history traits. We find extensive latitudinal
   differentiation, with many of the most strongly differentiated genes
   involved in major functional pathways such as the insulin/TOR, ecdysone,
   torso, EGFR, TGF beta/BMP, JAK/STAT, immunity and circadian rhythm
   pathways. We observe particularly strong differentiation on chromosome
   3R, especially within the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne, which
   contains a large number of clinally varying genes. While much of the
   differentiation might be driven by clinal differences in the frequency
   of In(3R)P, we also identify genes that are likely independent of this
   inversion. Our results provide genome-wide evidence consistent with
   pervasive spatially variable selection acting on numerous loci and
   pathways along the well-known North American cline, with many candidates
   implicated in life history regulation and exhibiting parallel
   differentiation along the previously investigated Australian cline.}},

Abstract = {{Combining experimental evolution with whole-genome resequencing is a
   promising new strategy for investigating the dynamics of evolutionary
   change. Published studies that have resequenced laboratory-selected
   populations of sexual organisms have typically focused on populations
   sampled at the end of an evolution experiment. These studies have
   attempted to associate particular alleles with phenotypic change and
   attempted to distinguish between different theoretical models of
   adaptation. However, neither the population used to initiate the
   experiment nor multiple time points sampled during the evolutionary
   trajectory are generally available for examination. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Orozco-terWengel et similar to al. (2012) take a
   significant step forward by estimating genome-wide allele frequencies at
   the start, 15 generations into and at the end of a 37-generation
   Drosophila experimental evolution study. The authors identify regions of
   the genome that have responded to laboratory selection and describe the
   temporal dynamics of allele frequency change. They identify two common
   trajectories for putatively adaptive alleles: alleles either gradually
   increase in frequency throughout the entire 37 generations or alleles
   plateau at a new frequency by generation 15. The identification of
   complex trajectories of alleles under selection contributes to a growing
   body of literature suggesting that simple models of adaptation, whereby
   beneficial alleles arise and increase in frequency unimpeded until they
   become fixed, may not adequately describe short-term response to
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its important effects on the ecological dynamics and the genetic
   structure of species, biologists have long been interested in
   gender-biased dispersal, a condition where one gender is more prone to
   move from the natal site. More recently, this topic has attracted a
   great attention from human evolutionary geneticists. Considering the
   close relations between residential rules and social structure,
   gender-biased dispersal is, in fact, regarded as an important case study
   concerning the effects of socio-cultural factors on human genetic
   variation. It all started with the seminal paper by Mark Seielstad,
   Erich Minch and Luigi Luca Cavalli Sforza from Stanford University
   (Seielstad et similar to al. 1998). They observed a larger
   differentiation for Y-chromosome than mitochondrial DNA between extant
   human populations, purportedly a consequence of the prevalence of
   long-term patrilocality in human societies. Subsequent studies, however,
   have highlighted the need to consider geographically close and
   culturally homogeneous groups, disentangle signals due to different
   peopling events and obtain unbiased estimates of genetic diversity. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, not only do Marks et similar to al.
   (2012) adopt an experimental design which addresses these concerns, but
   they also take a further and important step forward by integrating the
   genetic analysis of two distant populations, the Basotho and Spanish,
   with data regarding migration rates and matrimonial distances. Using
   both empirical evidence and simulations, the authors show that
   female-biased migration due to patrilocality might shape the genetic
   structure of human populations only at short ranges and under
   substantial differences in migration rates between genders. Providing a
   quantitative framework for future studies of the effects of residential
   rules on the human genome, this study paves the way for further
   developments in the field. On a wider perspective, Marks et similar to
   al.'s work demonstrates the power of approaches which integrate
   biological, cultural and demographic lines of evidence in the study of
   relations between social and genetic structures of human populations.}},

Abstract = {{Orchids typically depend on fungi for establishment from seeds, forming
   mycorrhizal associations with basidiomycete fungal partners in the
   polyphyletic group rhizoctonia from early stages of germination,
   sometimes with very high specificity. This has raised important
   questions about the roles of plant and fungal phylogenetics, and their
   habitat preferences, in controlling which fungi associate with which
   plants. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Martos et al. (2012) report
   the largest network analysis to date for orchids and their mycorrhizal
   fungi, sampling a total of over 450 plants from nearly half the 150
   tropical orchid species on Reunion Island, encompassing its main
   terrestrial and epiphytic orchid genera. The authors found a total of 95
   operational taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi and investigated the
   architecture and nestedness of their bipartite networks with 73 orchid
   species. The most striking finding was a major ecological barrier
   between above- and belowground mycorrhizal fungal networks, despite both
   epiphytic and terrestrial orchids often associating with closely related
   taxa across all three major lineages of rhizoctonia fungi. The fungal
   partnerships of the epiphytes and terrestrial species involved a
   diversity of fungal taxa in a modular network architecture, with only
   about one in ten mycorrhizal fungi partnering orchids in both groups. In
   contrast, plant and fungal phylogenetics had weak or no effects on the
   network. This highlights the power of recently developed ecological
   network analyses to give new insights into controls on plantfungal
   symbioses and raises exciting new hypotheses about the differences in
   properties and functioning of mycorrhiza in epiphytic and terrestrial
   orchids.}},

Abstract = {{Reproducibility is the benchmark for results and conclusions drawn from
   scientific studies, but systematic studies on the reproducibility of
   scientific results are surprisingly rare. Moreover, many modern
   statistical methods make use of `random walk' model fitting procedures,
   and these are inherently stochastic in their output. Does the
   combination of these statistical procedures and current standards of
   data archiving and method reporting permit the reproduction of the
   authors' results? To test this, we reanalysed data sets gathered from
   papers using the software package STRUCTURE to identify genetically
   similar clusters of individuals. We find that reproducing STRUCTURE
   results can be difficult despite the straightforward requirements of the
   program. Our results indicate that 30\% of analyses were unable to
   reproduce the same number of population clusters. To improve this, we
   make recommendations for future use of the software and for reporting
   STRUCTURE analyses and results in published works.}},

Abstract = {{The genomic basis of adaptation to novel environments is a fundamental
   problem in evolutionary biology that has gained additional importance in
   the light of the recent global change discussion. Here, we combined
   laboratory natural selection (experimental evolution) in Drosophila
   melanogaster with genome-wide next generation sequencing of DNA pools
   (Pool-Seq) to identify alleles that are favourable in a novel laboratory
   environment and traced their trajectories during the adaptive process.
   Already after 15 generations, we identified a pronounced genomic
   response to selection, with almost 5000 single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNP; genome-wide false discovery rates < 0.005\%) deviating from
   neutral expectation. Importantly, the evolutionary trajectories of the
   selected alleles were heterogeneous, with the alleles falling into two
   distinct classes: (i) alleles that continuously rise in frequency; and
   (ii) alleles that at first increase rapidly but whose frequencies then
   reach a plateau. Our data thus suggest that the genomic response to
   selection can involve a large number of selected SNPs that show
   unexpectedly complex evolutionary trajectories, possibly due to
   nonadditive effects.}},

Title = {{A disproportionate role for mtDNA in Dobzhansky-Muller
   incompatibilities?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4942-4957}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Evolution in allopatric populations can lead to incompatibilities that
   result in reduced hybrid fitness and ultimately reproductive isolation
   upon secondary contact. The DobzhanskyMuller (DM) model nicely accounts
   for the evolution of such incompatibilities. Although DM
   incompatibilities were originally conceived as resulting of interactions
   between nuclear genes, recent studies have documented cases where
   incompatibilities have arisen between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes
   (mtDNA). Although mtDNA comprises only a tiny component (typically <<
   0.01\%) of an organism's genetic material, several features of mtDNA may
   lead to a disproportionate contribution to the evolution of hybrid
   incompatibilities: (i) essentially all functions of mtDNA require
   interaction with nuclear gene products. All mtDNA-encoded proteins are
   components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and all
   mtDNA-encoded RNAs are part of the mitochondrial protein synthetic
   machinery; both processes require interaction with nuclear-encoded
   proteins for function. (ii) Transcription and replication of mtDNA also
   involve mitonuclear interactions as nuclear-encoded proteins must bind
   to regulatory motifs in the mtDNA to initiate these processes. (iii)
   Although features of mtDNA vary amongst taxa, metazoan mtDNA is
   typically characterized by high nucleotide substitution rates, lack of
   recombination and reduced effective population sizes that collectively
   lead to increased chance fixation of mildly deleterious mutations.
   Combined, these features create an evolutionary dynamic where rapid
   mtDNA evolution favours compensatory nuclear gene evolution, ultimately
   leading to co-adaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. When
   previously isolated lineages hybridize in nature or in the lab,
   intergenomic co-adaptation is disrupted and hybrid breakdown is
   observed; the role of intergenomic co-adaptation in hybrid breakdown and
   speciation will generally be most pronounced when rates of mtDNA
   evolution are high or when restricted gene flow results in significant
   population differentiation.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{In patrilocal groups, females preferentially move to join their mates
   paternal relatives. The gender-biased gene flow generated by this
   cultural practice is expected to affect genetic diversity across human
   populations. Greater female than male migration is predicted to result
   in a larger decrease in between-group differentiation for mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) than for the non-recombining part of the Y chromosome (NRY).
   We address the question of how patrilocality affects the distribution of
   genetic variation in human populations controlling for confounding
   factors such as ethno-linguistic heterogeneity and geographic distance
   which possibly explain the contradictory results observed in previous
   studies. By combining genetic and bio-demographic data from Lesotho and
   Spain, we show that preferential female migration over short distances
   appears to minimize the impact of a generally higher female migration
   rate in patrilocal communities, suggesting patrilocality might influence
   genetic variation only at short ranges.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{4970-4982}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetic studies use spatially explicit population genetic
   information to determine the physical and environmental causes of
   population genetic structure on regional scales. Comparative studies
   that identify common barriers to gene flow across multiple species
   within a community are important to both understand the evolutionary
   trajectories of populations and prioritize habitat conservation. Here,
   we use a comparative landscape genetic approach to ask whether gradients
   in temperature or precipitation seasonality structure genetic variation
   across three codistributed tree species in Central America, or whether a
   simpler (geographic distance) or more complex, species-specific
   environmental niche model is necessary to individually explain
   population genetic structure. Using descriptive statistics and causal
   modelling, we find that different factors best explain genetic distance
   in each of the three species: environmental niche distance in Bursera
   simaruba, geographic distance in Ficus insipida and historical barriers
   to gene flow or cryptic reproductive barriers for Brosimum alicastrum.
   This study confirms suggestions from previous studies of Central
   American tree species that imply that population genetic structure of
   trees in this region is determined by complex interactions of both
   historical and current barriers to gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of survival during the Pleistocene glaciation periods have
   been studied for more than a century. Until now, molecular studies that
   confirmed animal survival on Alpine nunataks, that is, ice-free summits
   surrounded by glaciers, were restricted to peripheral areas. Here, we
   search for molecular signatures of inner-Alpine survival of the narrow
   endemic and putatively parthenogenetic Alpine jumping bristletail
   Machilis pallida combining mitochondrial and AFLP data from its three
   known populations. The mitochondrial data indicate survival on both
   peripheral and central nunataks, the latter suggesting that refugia in
   the centre of the Alpine main ridge were more widespread than previously
   recognized. Incongruences between mitochondrial and AFLP patterns
   suggest a complex evolutionary history of the species and may be
   explained via parallel fixation of parthenogenesis of different origins
   during the last glacial maximum. We suggest that the inferred
   parthenogenesis may have been essential for central nunatak survival,
   but may pose a serious threat for M. pallida in consideration of the
   present climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal plant pathogens, especially rust fungi (Pucciniales), are well
   known for their complex life cycles, which include phases of sexual and
   asexual reproduction. The effect of asexual multiplication on population
   genetic diversity has been investigated in the poplar rust fungus
   Melampsora larici-populina using a nested hierarchical sampling scheme.
   Four hierarchical levels were considered: leaf, twig, tree and site.
   Both cultivated and wild poplar stands were sampled at two time points
   at the start and end of rust epidemics. A total of 641 fungal isolates
   was analysed using nine microsatellite markers. This study revealed that
   the genetic signature of asexual multiplication in the wild poplar stand
   was seen only at lower hierarchical levels (leaf and twig). Moreover, we
   observed an erosion of clonal structure through time, with an increase
   in both gene and genotypic diversity. New genotypes contributed to host
   infection over time, which demonstrates the importance of allo-infection
   in the epidemic process in this host-pathogen system. Compared with the
   wild stands, the nearly lack of detection of clonal structure in the
   cultivated stands reflects the higher infection level on cultivated
   poplars. More generally, this genetic analysis illustrates the utility
   of population genetics approach for elucidating the proportion of
   asexual reproduction in the multiplication of isolates during an
   epidemic, and for proper quantification of asexual dispersal in plant
   pathogens.}},

   disproportionally more offspring) may not be straightforward because of
   stochastic environmental processes that create high variance in
   reproductive success among adults. In this study, we investigated the
   relationships between oceanography, reproductive success and
   reproductive variance in the black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, a
   long-lived temperate reef fish with pelagic larvae. We quantified black
   rockfish recruitment, genetic diversity and growth rates from otolith
   microstructure over 5 years (20052009) during which oceanographic
   conditions differed. We used cross-correlations to determine windows of
   time during which oceanographic variables were significantly correlated
   with the resulting abundance or genetic diversity of recruits. We found
   that warmer ocean temperatures were positively correlated with the
   abundance of recruits, as well as the effective number of breeders. In
   contrast, the strength of coastal upwelling during settlement was
   positively correlated with the annual abundance of new recruits, but was
   negatively correlated with the effective number of breeders. Larval
   growth rates were explained substantially more by temperature than by
   upwelling and suggested that temperature affected survival through
   growth, while upwelling affected survival through transport. Our results
   indicated that cold ocean temperatures and intense upwelling caused
   sweepstakes-like processes to operate on black rockfish populations,
   despite high abundances of recruits. We propose that a decoupling of the
   mean and variance in reproductive success may be characteristic of
   organisms that reproduce into uncertain environments.}},

Abstract = {{Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-2 (AANAT2) is the enzyme responsible
   for the rhythmic production of the time-keeping hormone melatonin. It
   plays a crucial role in the synchronization of biological functions with
   changes in the environment. Annual and daily fluctuations in light are
   known to be key environmental factors involved in such synchronization.
   Previous studies have demonstrated that AANAT2 activity is also markedly
   influenced by temperature but the mechanisms through which it impacts
   the enzyme activity need to be further deciphered. We investigated
   AANAT2 primary to tertiary structures (3D models) and kinetics in
   relation to temperature for a variety of Teleost species from tropical
   to Arctic environments. The results extend our knowledge on the
   catalytic mechanisms of AANAT enzymes and bring strong support to the
   idea that AANAT2 diversification was limited by stabilizing selection
   conferring to the enzyme well conserved secondary and tertiary
   structures. Only a few changes in amino acids appeared sufficient to
   induce different enzyme activity patterns. It is concluded that AANAT2
   evolution is mainly driven by phylogenetic relationships although
   catalytic properties (enzyme turnover and substrate affinity) are also
   under the influence of the respective species normal habitat
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of species barriers in the face of gene flow is often
   thought to result from strong selection against intermediate genotypes,
   thereby preserving genetic differentiation. Most speciation genomic
   studies thus aim to identify exceptionally divergent loci between
   populations, but divergence will be affected by many processes other
   than reproductive isolation (RI) and speciation. Through genomic studies
   of recombinant hybrids sampled in the wild, genetic variation associated
   with RI can be observed in situ, because selection against incompatible
   genotypes will leave detectable patterns of variation in the hybrid
   genomes. To better understand the mechanisms directly involved in RI, we
   investigated three natural replicate hybrid zones between two divergent
   Populus species via locus-specific patterns of ancestry across
   recombinant hybrid genomes. As expected, genomic patterns in hybrids and
   their parental species were consistent with the presence of
   underdominant selection at several genomic regions. Surprisingly, many
   loci displayed greatly increased between-species heterozygosity in
   recombinant hybrids despite striking genetic differentiation between the
   parental genomes, the opposite of what would be expected with selection
   against intermediate genotypes. Only a limited, reproducible set of
   genotypic combinations was present in hybrid genomes across localities.
   In the absence of clearly delimited hybrid habitats, our results suggest
   that complex epistatic interactions within genomes play an important
   role in advanced stages of RI between these ecologically divergent
   forest trees. This calls for more genomic studies that test for unusual
   patterns of genomic ancestry in hybridizing species.}},

Abstract = {{Genealogical discordance, or when different genes tell distinct stories
   although they evolved under a shared history, often emerges from either
   coalescent stochasticity or introgression. In this study, we present a
   strong case of mito-nuclear genealogical discordance in the Australian
   rainforest lizard species complex of Saproscincus basiliscus and S.
   lewisi. One of the lineages that comprises this complex, the Southern S.
   basiliscus lineage, is deeply divergent at the mitochondrial genome but
   shows markedly less divergence at the nuclear genome. By placing our
   results in a comparative context and reconstructing the lineages'
   demography via multilocus and coalescent-based approximate Bayesian
   computation methods, we test hypotheses for how coalescent variance and
   introgression contribute to this pattern. These analyses suggest that
   the observed genealogical discordance likely results from introgression.
   Further, to generate such strong discordance, introgression probably
   acted in concert with other factors promoting asymmetric gene flow
   between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, such as selection or
   sex-biased dispersal. This study offers a framework for testing sources
   of genealogical discordance and suggests that historical introgression
   can be an important force shaping the genetic diversity of species and
   their populations.}},

Abstract = {{A species' mating system sets limits on the strength of sexual
   selection. Sexual selection is widespread in dioecious species, but is
   less well documented in hermaphrodites, and may be less important. We
   used four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to assign paternity
   to broods of the hermaphroditic eastern Pacific volcano barnacle
   Tetraclita rubescens. These data were used to describe the species'
   mating system and to examine factors affecting male reproductive
   success. Tetraclita can sire broods over distances of 11.2 cm, but
   proximity to the sperm recipient had a highly significant effect on the
   probability of siring success. There was no effect of body size or the
   mass of male reproductive tissues on siring success. Broods showed
   relatively low frequencies of multiple paternity; even at high
   densities, 75\% of broods had only one father. High frequencies of
   single-paternity broods imply either that this species does not compete
   via sperm displacement, or that sperm displacement is extremely
   effective, potentially explaining the lack of a positive relationship
   between male investment and paternity. In addition, there was low
   variance in siring success among individuals, suggesting a lack of
   strong sexual selection on male traits. Low variance among sires and the
   strong effect of proximity are probably driven by the unusual biology of
   a sessile copulating species.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the architecture of bipartite networks is increasingly
   used as a framework to study biotic interactions within their ecological
   context and to assess the extent to which evolutionary constraint shape
   them. Orchid mycorrhizal symbioses are particularly interesting as they
   are viewed as more beneficial for plants than for fungi, a situation
   expected to result in an asymmetry of biological constraint. This study
   addressed the architecture and phylogenetic constraint in these
   associations in tropical context. We identified a bipartite network
   including 73 orchid species and 95 taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi
   across the natural habitats of Reunion Island. Unlike some recent
   evidence for nestedness in mycorrhizal symbioses, we found a highly
   modular architecture that largely reflected an ecological barrier
   between epiphytic and terrestrial subnetworks. By testing for
   phylogenetic signal, the overall signal was stronger for both partners
   in the epiphytic subnetwork. Moreover, in the subnetwork of epiphytic
   angraecoid orchids, the signal in orchid phylogeny was stronger than the
   signal in fungal phylogeny. Epiphytic associations are therefore more
   conservative and may co-evolve more than terrestrial ones. We suggest
   that such tighter phylogenetic specialization may have been driven by
   stressful life conditions in the epiphytic niches. In addition to
   paralleling recent insights into mycorrhizal networks, this study
   furthermore provides support for epiphytism as a major factor affecting
   ecological assemblage and evolutionary constraint in tropical
   mycorrhizal symbioses.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial ecology has made large advances over the last decade, mostly
   because of improvements in molecular analysis techniques that have
   enabled the detection and identification of progressively larger numbers
   of microbial species. However, determining the ecological patterns and
   processes taking place in communities of microbes remains a significant
   challenge. Are communities randomly assembled through dispersal and
   priority effects, or do species interact with each other leading to
   positive and negative associations? For mycorrhizal fungi, evidence is
   accumulating that stochastic and competitive interactions between
   species may both have a role in shaping community structure. Could the
   methodological approach, which is often incidence based, impact the
   outcomes detected? Here, we applied an incidence-based Terminal
   Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) database approach to
   examine species diversity and ecological interactions within a community
   of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the
   ECM community colonizing root tips was strongly structured by
   competitive interactions, or ecological processes generating a similar
   spatial pattern, rather than neutral processes. Analysis of
   beta-diversity indicated that community structure was significantly more
   similar (spatially autocorrelated) at distances equal to or <3.41 m. The
   eight most frequently encountered species in the root tip community of
   ECM fungi displayed significant competitive interactions with at least
   one other species, showing that the incidence-based approach was capable
   of detecting this sort of ecological information.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects contain diverse gut microbial communities. While several
   studies have focused on a single or small group of species, comparative
   studies of phylogenetically diverse hosts can illuminate general
   patterns of hostmicrobiota associations. In this study, we tested the
   hypotheses that (i) host diet and (ii) host taxonomy structure
   intestinal bacterial community composition among insects. We used
   published 16S rRNA gene sequence data for 58 insect species in addition
   to four beetle species sampled from the Sevilleta National Wildlife
   Refuge to test these hypotheses. Overall, gut bacterial species richness
   in these insects was low. Decaying wood xylophagous insects harboured
   the richest bacterial gut flora (102.8 species level operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs)/sample +/- 71.7, 11.8 +/- 5.9 phylogenetic
   diversity (PD)/sample), while bees and wasps harboured the least rich
   bacterial communities (11.0 species level OTUs/sample +/- 5.4, 2.6 +/-
   0.8 PD/sample). We found evidence to support our hypotheses that host
   diet and taxonomy structure insect gut bacterial communities (P < 0.001
   for both). However, while host taxonomy was important in hymenopteran
   and termite gut community structure, diet was an important community
   structuring factor particularly for insect hosts that ingest
   lignocellulose-derived substances. Our analysis provides a baseline
   comparison of insect gut bacterial communities from which to test
   further hypotheses concerning proximate and ultimate causes of these
   associations.}},

Abstract = {{The mosquito midgut is a hostile environment that vector-borne parasites
   must survive to be transmitted. Commensal bacteria in the midgut can
   reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease, either by having
   direct anti-parasite effects or by stimulating basal immune responses of
   the insect host. As different bacteria have different effects on
   parasite development, the composition of the bacterial community in the
   mosquito gut is likely to affect the probability of disease
   transmission. We investigated the diversity of mosquito gut bacteria in
   the field using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to build up a
   comprehensive picture of the diversity of gut bacteria in eight mosquito
   species in this population. We found that mosquito gut typically has a
   very simple gut microbiota that is dominated by a single bacterial
   taxon. Although different mosquito species share remarkably similar gut
   bacteria, individuals in a population are extremely variable and can
   have little overlap in the bacterial taxa present in their guts. This
   may be an important factor in causing differences in disease
   transmission rates within mosquito populations.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists have paid close attention to environmental effects that
   fitness-enhancing transgenes might have following crop-to-wild gene flow
   (e.g. Snow 2003). For some crops, gene flow also can lead to legal
   problems, especially when government agencies have not approved
   transgenic events for unrestricted environmental release. Creeping
   bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), a common turfgrass used in golf
   courses, is the focus of both areas of concern. In 2002, prior to
   expected deregulation (still pending), The Scotts Company planted
   creeping bentgrass with transgenic resistance to the herbicide
   glyphosate, also known as RoundUp (R), on 162 ha in a designated control
   area in central Oregon (Fig. 1). Despite efforts to restrict gene flow,
   wind-dispersed pollen carried transgenes to florets of local A.
   stolonifera and A. gigantea as far as 14 km away, and to sentinel plants
   placed as far as 21 km away (Watrud 2004). Then, in August 2003, a
   strong wind event moved transgenic seeds from windrows of cut bentgrass
   into nearby areas. The companys efforts to kill all transgenic survivors
   in the area failed: feral glyphosate-resistant populations of A.
   stolonifera were found by Reichman (2006), and 62\% of 585 bentgrass
   plants had the telltale CP4 EPSPS transgene in 2006 (Zapiola 2008; Fig.
   2). Now, in this issue, the story gets even more interesting as Zapiola
   \& Mallory-Smith (2012) describe a transgenic, intergeneric hybrid
   produced on a feral, transgenic creeping bentgrass plant that received
   pollen from Polypogon monspeliensis (rabbitfoot grass). Their finding
   raises a host of new questions about the prevalence and fitness of
   intergeneric hybrids, as well as how to evaluate the full extent of gene
   flow from transgenic crops. 1 Creeping bentgrass and rabbitfoot grass

Abstract = {{Intraspecific genetic variation can affect community structure and
   ecosystem processes (Bolnick et al. 2011). It can also influence
   phenotypic expression by genotypes within other species to produce
   genotype-by-genotype (G x G) interaction (Falconer \& Mackay 1996).
   Evolution of one species drives correlated evolution of others when it
   causes G x G for fitness (Thompson 2005). However, the mechanisms by
   which species interact also influence evolutionary outcomes (Kummel \&
   Salant 2006; Golubski \& Klausmeier 2010; Akcay \& Simms 2011; Grman et
   al. 2012). To identify genes and putative functional mechanisms
   underlying G x G interactions, Heath et al. (2012) analysed natural
   variation in the symbiotic transcriptome of the mutualistic nutritional
   symbiosis between a legume host Medicago truncatula and the facultative
   endosymbiotic rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti. Using twelve
   microarrays, the authors simultaneously measured host and symbiont gene
   expression in root nodules from four factorial pairings of host and
   symbiont genotypes that produced G x G in host fitness (Fig. 1, upper
   panel). Rhizobium gene expression was influenced by rhizobium and plant
   genotype and the G x G interaction (Fig. 1, lower panel), whereas plant
   gene expression was influenced primarily by plant genotype. The authors
   identified rhizobium genes that might contribute to G x G in host plant
   fitness. Heath et al. (2012) have moved beyond the constraints of single
   organism analysis towards a more realistic understanding of plants and
   bacteria as organisms inextricably linked with symbioses that affect
   even basic patterns of gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Human activity and climate change are increasingly driving species,
   which were once separate together, leading to the potential for gene
   flow. Hybridization between diverged species brings together two genomes
   which have evolved to meet different adaptive requirements. The unique
   combination of these traits in a hybrid may be beneficial or
   maladaptive, but either way it results in increased phenotypic
   variation. A percentage of hybrid individuals may, therefore, find
   themselves able to exploit environmental niches which their progenitors
   cannot, leading to invasive hybrid swarms becoming established in new
   habitats. Previous research into hybrids, most famously that of Loren
   Rieseberg and co-workers (Rieseberg et al. 1999, 2003) in sunflowers,
   demonstrated that hybridization can give rise to transgressive
   segregation of adaptive traits, wherein the combination of favourable
   alleles from both parents in hybrids can enable them to outperform
   either. However, the question still remains as to how much of the
   competitive ability of hybrids is a direct result of admixture and how
   much is the result of selection after the fact. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, (Czypionka et al. 2012) describe their study of
   transcriptional changes resulting from hybridization in a fish hybrid
   termed invasive sculpins (Cottus). Using gene expression microarray
   assays, they compare gene expression in both wild and lab-reared
   invasive hybrids to the progenitor species and experimentally produced
   F2 hybrids. They demonstrate that whilst hybridization alone does result
   in higher variance in gene expression (some of which is transgressive),
   many of the transgressive changes distinguishing the invasives appear to
   have come about subsequent to the initial natural hybridization event.
   They speculate that initial success of the hybrids in their new habitat
   is facilitated by hybridization, but that optimization of the invasive
   phenotype and removal of maladaptive traits rapidly reduces the
   variation in gene expression seen in early hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Gene flow is the most frequently expressed public concern related to the
   deregulation of transgenic events (Snow 2002; Ellstrand 2003). However,
   assessing the potential for transgene escape is complex because it
   depends on the opportunities for unintended gene flow, and establishment
   and persistence of the transgene in the environment (Warwick 2008).
   Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), a turfgrass species widely
   used on golf courses, has been genetically engineered to be resistant to
   glyphosate, a nonselective herbicide. Outcrossing species, such as
   creeping bentgrass (CB), which have several compatible species, have
   greater chances for gene escape and spontaneous hybridization (i.e.
   natural, unassisted sexual reproduction between taxa in the field),
   which challenges transgene containment. Several authors have emphasized
   the need for evidence of spontaneous hybridization to infer the
   potential for gene flow (Armstrong 2005). Here we report that a
   transgenic intergeneric hybrid has been produced as result of
   spontaneous hybridization of a feral-regulated transgenic pollen
   receptor (CB) and a nontransgenic pollen donor (rabbitfoot grass, RF,
   Polypogon monspeliensis (L.) Desf.). We identified an off-type
   transgenic seedling and confirmed it to be CB x RF intergeneric hybrid.
   This first report of a transgenic intergeneric hybrid produced in situ
   with a regulated transgenic event demonstrates the importance of
   considering all possible avenues for transgene spread at the landscape
   level before planting a regulated transgenic crop in the field.
   Spontaneous hybridization adds a level of complexity to transgene
   monitoring, containment, mitigation and remediation programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The Andricus mukaigawae complex of oak gall wasps is composed of
   cyclically parthenogenetic species: A. mukaigawae and Andricus
   kashiwaphilus, and a parthenogenetic species, Andricus pseudoflos. The
   component species differ in life history, host plant, karyotype, and
   asexual gall shape, although little difference is found in the external
   morphology of asexual adults. To understand the speciation history of
   this species complex, DNA sequences of one mitochondrial region and nine
   nuclear gene regions were investigated. The genetic relationship among
   the species suggested that a loss of sex occurred after host shift.
   Unexpectedly, two or three distinct groups in the parthenogenetic
   species, A. pseudoflos, were revealed by both mitochondrial and nuclear
   DNA data. Gene flow in nuclear genes from the species not infected by
   Wolbachia (A. kashiwaphilus) to the species infected by it (A.
   mukaigawae) was suggested by a method based on coalescent simulations.
   On the other hand, gene flow in mitochondrial genes was suggested to be
   in the opposite direction. These findings indicate possible involvement
   of Wolbachia infection in the speciation process of the A. mukaigawae
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{Connectivity, the demographic linking of local populations through the
   dispersal of individuals, is one of the most poorly understood processes
   in population dynamics, yet has profound implications for conservation
   and harvest strategies. For marine species with pelagic larvae, direct
   estimation of connectivity remains logistically challenging and has
   mostly been limited to single snapshots in time. Here, we document
   seasonal and interannual patterns of larval dispersal in a
   metapopulation of the coral reef fish Amphiprion polymnus. A 3-year
   record of larval trajectories within and among nine discrete local
   populations from an area of approximately 35 km was established by
   determining the natal origin of settled juveniles through DNA parentage
   analysis. We found that spatial patterns of both self-recruitment and
   connectivity were remarkably consistent over time, with a low level of
   self-recruitment at the scale of individual sites. Connectivity among
   sites was common and multidirectional in all years and was not
   significantly influenced by seasonal variability of predominant surface
   current directions. However, approximately 75\% of the sampled juveniles
   could not be assigned to parents within the study area, indicating high
   levels of immigrations from sources outside the study area. The data
   support predictions that the magnitude and temporal stability of larval
   connectivity decreases significantly with increasing distance between
   subpopulations, but increases with the size of subpopulations. Given the
   considerable effort needed to directly measure larval exchange, the
   consistent patterns suggest snapshot parentage analyses can provide
   useful dispersal estimates to inform spatial management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians display wide variations in life-history traits and life
   cycles that should prove useful to explore the evolution of sex-biased
   dispersal, but quantitative data on sex-specific dispersal patterns are
   scarce. Here, we focused on Salamandra atra, an endemic alpine species
   showing peculiar life-history traits. Strictly terrestrial and
   viviparous, the species has a promiscuous mating system, and females
   reproduce only every 3 to 4 years. In the present study, we provide
   quantitative estimates of asymmetries in male vs. female dispersal using
   both field-based (markrecapture) and genetic approaches (detection of
   sex-biased dispersal and estimates of migration rates based on the
   contrast in genetic structure across sexes and age classes). Our results
   revealed a high level of gene flow among populations, which stems
   exclusively from male dispersal. We hypothesize that philopatric females
   benefit from being familiar with their natal area for the acquisition
   and defence of an appropriate shelter, while male dispersal has been
   secondarily favoured by inbreeding avoidance. Together with other
   studies on amphibians, our results indicate that a species' mating
   system alone is a poor predictor of sex-linked differences in dispersal,
   in particular for promiscuous species. Further studies should focus more
   directly on the proximate forces that favour or limit dispersal to
   refine our understanding of the evolution of sex-biased dispersal in
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{Species invading new ranges are subject to a series of demographic
   events that can strongly shape genetic diversity. Describing this
   demographic history is important for understanding where invasive
   species come from and how they spread, and is critical to testing
   hypotheses of postinvasion adaptation. Here, we analyse nuclear and
   chloroplast genetic diversity to study the invasion history of the
   widespread colonizing weed, Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae). Bayesian
   clustering and PCA revealed strong population structure in the native
   range of Europe, and although genotypes from multiple native sources
   were present in the introduced range of North America, the spatial
   distribution of genetic variance was dramatically reorganized. Using
   approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we compared support for
   different invasion scenarios, including the number and size of
   independent introduction events and the amount of admixture occurring
   between sources of introduced genotypes. Our results supported
   independent introductions into eastern and western North America, with
   the latter forming a bridgehead for a secondary invasion into the Great
   Lakes region of central North America. Despite small estimated founder
   population sizes, the duration of the demographic bottleneck after the
   initial introduction appeared extremely short-lived. This pattern of
   repeated colonization and rapid expansion has effectively eroded the
   strong population structure and cytonuclear associations present in
   Europe, but has retained overall high genetic diversity since invasion.
   Our results highlight the flexibility of the ABC approach for
   constructing a narrative of the demographic history of species invasions
   and provide baseline for future studies of evolutionary changes in
   introduced S. latifolia populations.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{4735-4747}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Coevolutionary change requires reciprocal selection between interacting
   species, where the partner genotypes that are favoured in one species
   depend on the genetic composition of the interacting species.
   Coevolutionary genetic variation is manifested as genotype x genotype (G
   x G) interactions for fitness in interspecific interactions. Although
   quantitative genetic approaches have revealed abundant evidence for G x
   G interactions in symbioses, the molecular basis of this variation
   remains unclear. Here we study the molecular basis of G x G interactions
   in a model legume-rhizobium mutualism using gene expression microarrays.
   We find that, like quantitative traits such as fitness, variation in the
   symbiotic transcriptome may be partitioned into additive and interactive
   genetic components. Our results suggest that plant genetic variation had
   the largest influence on nodule gene expression and that plant genotype
   and the plant genotype x rhizobium genotype interaction determine global
   shifts in rhizobium gene expression that in turn feedback to influence
   plant fitness benefits. Moreover, the transcriptomic variation we
   uncover implicates regulatory changes in both species as drivers of
   symbiotic gene expression variation. Our study is the first to partition
   genetic variation in a symbiotic transcriptome and illuminates potential
   molecular routes of coevolutionary change.}},

Abstract = {{Divergent selection is the main driving force in sympatric ecological
   speciation and may also play a strong role in divergence between
   allopatric populations. Characterizing the genome-wide impact of
   divergent selection often constitutes a first step in unravelling the
   genetic bases underlying adaptation and ecological speciation. The Midas
   cichlid fish (Amphilophus citrinellus) species complex in Nicaragua is a
   powerful system for studying evolutionary processes. Independent
   colonizations of isolated young crater lakes by Midas cichlid
   populations from the older and great lakes of Nicaragua resulted in the
   repeated evolution of adaptive radiations by intralacustrine sympatric
   speciation. In this study we performed genome scans on two repeated
   radiations of crater lake species and their great lake source
   populations (1030 polymorphic AFLPs, n 30 individuals per species). We
   detected regions under divergent selection (0.3\% in the crater lake
   Xiloa flock and 1.7\% in the older crater lake Apoyo radiation) that
   might be responsible for the sympatric diversifications. We find no
   evidence that the same genomic regions have been involved in the
   repeated evolution of parallel adaptations across crater lake flocks.
   However, there is some genetic parallelism apparent (seven out of 51
   crater lake to great lake outlier loci are shared; 13.7\%) that is
   associated with the allopatric divergence of both crater lake flocks.
   Interestingly, our results suggest that the number of outlier loci
   involved in sympatric and allopatric divergence increases over time. A
   phylogeny based on the AFLP data clearly supports the monophyly of both
   crater lake species flocks and indicates a parallel branching order with
   a primary split along the limnetic-benthic axis in both radiations.}},

Abstract = {{Protective immunity is expected to evolve when the costs of mounting an
   immune response are less than those of harbouring pathogens. Estimating
   the costs of immunity vs. pathogenesis in natural systems is
   challenging, however, because they are typically closely linked. Here we
   attempt to disentangle the relative cost of each using experimental
   infections in a natural hostparasite system in which hosts (house
   finches, Carpodacus mexicanus) differ in resistance to a bacterium
   (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, MG), depending on whether they originate from
   co-evolved or unexposed populations. Experimental infection with a
   2007-strain of MG caused finches from co-evolved populations to lose
   significantly more mass relative to controls, than those from unexposed
   populations. In addition, infected co-evolved finches that lost the most
   mass harboured the least amounts of MG, whereas the reverse was true in
   finches from unexposed populations. Finally, within co-evolved
   populations, individuals that displayed transcriptional evidence of
   higher protective immune activity, as indicated by changes in the
   expression of candidate immune and immune-related genes in a direction
   consistent with increased resistance to MG, showed greater mass loss and
   lower MG load. Thus, mass loss appeared to reflect the costs of immunity
   vs. pathogenesis in co-evolved and unexposed populations, respectively.
   Our results suggest that resistance can evolve even when the short-term
   energetic costs of protective immunity exceed those of pathogenesis,
   providing the longer-term fitness costs of infection are sufficiently
   high.}},

Abstract = {{Models on hybrid speciation assume that hybridization generates
   increased phenotypic variance that is utilized to invade new adaptive
   peaks. We test to what extent this prediction can be traced using gene
   expression data in the fish species Cottus perifretum and Cottus
   rhenanus as well as a natural hybrid lineage referred to as invasive
   sculpins. In addition, interspecies crosses were used to explore
   evolutionary trajectories from initial stages to the hybrid lineage. EST
   (expressed sequence tag) libraries were sequenced to design an
   oligonucleotide microarray that was calibrated for probe-specific
   differences in binding behaviour. Levels of gene expression divergence
   between species correlate with genetic divergence at neutral markers
   and, accordingly, invasive sculpins were intermediate between the
   parental species overall. However, the hybrid lineage is distinguished
   through unique patterns of gene expression that are enriched for
   biological functions which represent candidates for the fitness
   properties of invasive sculpins. We compare F2 crosses with natural
   invasive sculpins to show that the variance in gene expression decreases
   in invasives. Moreover, few of the transgressive patterns of gene
   expression that distinguish invasives can be directly observed in F2
   crosses. This suggests that the invasive transcriptome was subject to
   secondary changes after admixture. The result is in line with an
   evolutionary process that reduces maladaptive variance and optimizes the
   phenotype of an emerging hybrid lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus densata is an ecologically successful homoploid hybrid that
   inhabits vast areas of heterogeneous terrain on the south-eastern
   Tibetan Plateau as a result of multiple waves of colonization. Its
   region of origin, route of colonization onto the plateau and the
   directions of introgression with its parental species have previously
   been defined, but little is known about the isolation and divergence
   history of its populations. In this study, we surveyed nucleotide
   polymorphism over eight nuclear loci in 19 representative populations of
   P. densata and its parental species. Using this information and
   coalescence simulations, we assessed the historical changes in its
   population size, gene flow and divergence in time and space. The results
   indicate a late Miocene origin for P. densata associated with the recent
   uplift of south-eastern Tibet. The subsequent differentiation between
   geographical regions of this species began in the late Pliocene and was
   induced by regional topographical changes and Pleistocene glaciations.
   The ancestral P. densata population had a large effective population
   size but the central and western populations were established by limited
   founders, suggesting that there were severe bottlenecks during the
   westward migration out of the ancestral hybrid zone. After separating
   from their ancestral populations, population expansion occurred in all
   geographical regions especially in the western range. Gene flow in P.
   densata was restricted to geographically neighbouring populations,
   resulting in significant differentiation between regional groups. The
   new information on the divergence and demographic history of P. densata
   reported herein enhances our understanding of its speciation process on
   the Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing speciation processes in the sea remains a highly
   contentious issue because geographic barriers to gene exchange, which
   are the initial conditions for the allopatric speciation model, are not
   obvious. Moreover, many benthic marine organisms have long-lived
   planktonic larvae that allow them to connect distant patches of
   habitats. We here analyse the pattern of speciation in the gastropod
   genus Bursa in which all species have long-lived and planktonic-feeding
   larvae. We use a large taxonomic and ecologic coverage of Bursidae from
   the Indo-Pacific. We use an integrative approach to taxonomy to give
   more support to available taxonomic hypotheses. This analysis revealed
   cryptic lineages and suggest that a taxonomic revision of the family
   should be performed. A molecular clock calibrated from the fossil record
   was used to estimate divergence times. We then focus on the three
   co-existing species living in the deep waters of New Caledonia. Over the
   wide sampled area, no genetic structure was detected for the three
   species. We show that among New Caledonia species, Bursa fijiensis and
   Bursa quirihorai are reciprocally monophyletic. These two species are
   the two more closely related species in the inferred phylogeny. The
   present biogeographic ranges of the two species and the estimated time
   of divergence make the scenario of geographic isolation followed by
   secondary contact unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene have greatly influenced the
   distribution and connectivity of many organisms, leading to extinctions
   but also generating biodiversity. While the effects of such changes have
   been extensively studied in the terrestrial environment, studies
   focusing on the marine realm are still scarce. Here we used sequence
   data from one mitochondrial and five nuclear loci to assess the
   potential influence of Pleistocene climatic changes on the
   phylogeography and demographic history of a cosmopolitan marine
   predator, the common dolphin (genus Delphinus). Population samples
   representing the three major morphotypes of Delphinus were obtained from
   10 oceanic regions. Our results suggest that short-beaked common
   dolphins are likely to have originated in the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean
   during the Pleistocene and expanded into the Atlantic Ocean through the
   Indian Ocean. On the other hand, long-beaked common dolphins appear to
   have evolved more recently and independently in several oceans. Our
   results also suggest that short-beaked common dolphins had recurrent
   demographic expansions concomitant with changes in sea surface
   temperature during the Pleistocene and its associated increases in
   resource availability, which differed between the North Atlantic and
   Pacific Ocean basins. By proposing how past environmental changes had an
   effect on the demography and speciation of a widely distributed marine
   mammal, we highlight the impacts that climate change may have on the
   distribution and abundance of marine predators and its ecological
   consequences for marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The study of heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) has a long
   history in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology but remains
   controversial. Recently, it has been shown that the genetic distance of
   markers from functional loci can be an important factor to be considered
   in addition to marker numbers and variability. In this study, we
   investigated the correlation between individual heterozygosity and
   behaviour (aggression, boldness and feeding activity) in nine-spined
   stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) individuals originating from four
   populations in two contrasting environments. Offspring of full-sib
   families raised in a common garden setting were assessed for behaviour
   and genotyped using 84 microsatellite markers that were either located
   within or near behaviourally or physiologically important genes (termed
   functional) or were randomly selected. No associations were detected
   with any behavioural trait in any population or over all populations
   when genetic variability was measured using all 84 markers combined.
   However, when the markers were separated into three functional
   categories (behavioural, physiological and random), several significant
   associations were observed both with functional markers and random
   markers in one of the four populations assessed. Interestingly,
   contrasting correlations with behaviour were observed when using
   physiological gene (negative) and random (positive) markers. Upon
   dividing the physiological gene markers into further subcategories based
   on their specific physiological functions, a strong relationship between
   the heterozygosity of markers linked to osmoregulation-related genes,
   and behaviour was revealed in the brackish water population. Our results
   indicate that both local (physiological) and general (neutral) effects
   are important in shaping behaviour and that heterozygositybehaviour
   correlations are population dependent.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between species diversity and environmental parameters
   is poorly understood for the mobile macrofauna of deep-sea habitats due
   to under-sampling and subsequent lack of accurate taxonomic information.
   To redress this, cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) DNA sequences were
   used to estimate species diversity and to compare phoxocephalid amphipod
   assemblages among 20 stations encompassing a range of environmental
   conditions. Two regions, east (Chatham Rise) and west (Challenger
   Plateau) of New Zealand were sampled to depths of 2001200 m with an
   epibenthic sled. Using a comparison among identified morphospecies, we
   found a clear gap in sequence divergences between 6\% and 13\% and used
   a 6\% threshold to designate molecular operational taxonomic units
   (MOTUs), as a surrogate to putative species. DNA sequences (n = 297)
   revealed high total diversity (n = 49 MOTUs), as well as high beta
   diversity (28 MOTUs found at single location only). Novel phoxocephalid
   MOTUs were found at most stations, especially on Challenger Plateau and
   the flanks of Chatham Rise. Analyses of interstation assemblages
   revealed a major split between regions, indicating minimal overlap in
   taxon distributions. A cluster of highly similar stations was
   identified, broadly distributed over the crest of Chatham Rise, in
   association with elevated food availability, probably resulting from
   higher surface productivity and relatively shallow depth. Accordingly,
   multivariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between
   phoxocephalid assemblages and food supply. This study highlights the
   value of molecular approaches, in particular COI sequences, for
   quantifying and comparing diversity in under-sampled and/or
   under-studied taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Protease inhibitors of primary producers are a major food quality
   constraint for herbivores. In nutrient-rich freshwater ecosystems, the
   interaction between primary producers and herbivores is mainly
   represented by Daphnia and cyanobacteria. Protease inhibitors have been
   found in many cyanobacterial blooms. These inhibitors have been shown
   (both in vitro and in situ) to inhibit the most important group of
   digestive proteases in the daphnid's gut, that is, trypsins and
   chymotrypsins. In this study, we fed four different Daphnia magna
   genotypes with the trypsin-inhibitor-containing cyanobacterial strain
   Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 Mut. Upon exposure to dietary trypsin
   inhibitors, all D. magna genotypes showed increased gene expression of
   digestive trypsins and chymotrypsins. Exposure to dietary trypsin
   inhibitors resulted in increased activity of chymotrypsins and reduced
   activity of trypsin. Strong intraspecific differences in tolerance of
   the four D. magna genotypes to the dietary trypsin inhibitors were
   found. The degree of tolerance depended on the D. magna genotype. The
   genotypes' tolerance was positively correlated with the residual trypsin
   activity and the different IC50 values of the trypsins. On the genetic
   level, the different trypsin loci varied between the D. magna genotypes.
   The two tolerant Daphnia genotypes that both originate from the same
   lake, which frequently produces cyanobacterial blooms, clustered in a
   neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on the three trypsin loci.
   This suggests that the genetic variability of trypsin loci was an
   important cause for the observed intraspecific variability in tolerance
   to cyanobacterial trypsin inhibitors. Based on these findings, it is
   reasonable to assume that such genetic variability can also be found in
   natural populations and thus constitutes the basis for local adaptation
   of natural populations to dietary protease inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi play major ecological roles in temperate and
   tropical ecosystems. Although the richness of ECM fungal communities and
   the factors controlling their structure have been documented at local
   spatial scales, how they vary at larger spatial scales remains unclear.
   In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Tedersoo et al. (2012) present the
   results of a meta-analysis of ECM fungal community structure that sheds
   important new light on global-scale patterns. Using data from 69 study
   systems and 6021 fungal species, the researchers found that ECM fungal
   richness does not fit the classic latitudinal diversity gradient in
   which species richness peaks at lower latitudes. Instead, richness of
   ECM fungal communities has a unimodal relationship with latitude that
   peaks in temperate zones. Intriguingly, this conclusion suggests the
   mechanisms driving ECM fungal community richness may differ from those
   of many other organisms, including their plant hosts. Future research
   will be key to determine the robustness of this pattern and to examine
   the processes that generate and maintain global-scale gradients of ECM
   fungal richness.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptome profiling methods are rapidly changing the ways in which
   insect responses to the environment can be assessed. One article
   featured in this issue of Molecular Ecology utilizes global expression
   analysis to extend previous studies examining the basis of insecticide
   resistance in Helicoverpa species that are devastating crop pests
   worldwide. In this issue Tao (2012) have used a wide spectrum of
   biochemical and molecular techniques to examine the extent to which
   naturally occurring plant compounds and one synthetic insecticide change
   transcriptome profiles of Helicoverpa armigera larvae (Fig.1) to enhance
   their adaptation to plant toxins and insecticides in their diet and
   environment. With their data highlighting an array of P450 transcripts
   and a few esterase transcripts that are correlated with increased
   tolerance to the insecticide deltamethrin, these researchers provide the
   first comprehensive evaluation of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450),
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase (Est) gene responses in a
   lepidopteran species repeatedly subjected to pyrethroid selection.
   Building on this information, these researchers venture into the realm
   of the biorational in showing that RNAi-mediated destruction of one
   prominent toxin-inducible P450 transcript can increase sensitivity to
   deltamethrin, thereby compromising larval growth in the presence of this
   insecticide. The fact that the resulting levels of deltamethrin
   tolerance in the RNAi-silenced larvae are not restored completely to the
   levels in larvae whose defences are not stimulated by consuming plant
   compounds provides further evidence that their adaptive strategies for
   survival in toxin-rich environments include many different P450,
   esterase and, possibly, other genes. Together, their data highlight the
   complexity of the defence systems evolving in lepidopterans and other
   insect pests. 1 Helicoverpa armigera on cotton flower bud.}},

Abstract = {{Global species richness patterns of soil micro-organisms remain poorly
   understood compared to macro-organisms. We use a global analysis to
   disentangle the global determinants of diversity and community
   composition for ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi-microbial symbionts that
   play key roles in plant nutrition in most temperate and many tropical
   forest ecosystems. Host plant family has the strongest effect on the
   phylogenetic community composition of fungi, whereas temperature and
   precipitation mostly affect EcM fungal richness that peaks in the
   temperate and boreal forest biomes, contrasting with latitudinal
   patterns of macro-organisms. Tropical ecosystems experience rapid
   turnover of organic material and have weak soil stratification,
   suggesting that poor habitat conditions may contribute to the relatively
   low richness of EcM fungi, and perhaps other soil biota, in most
   tropical ecosystems. For EcM fungi, greater evolutionary age and larger
   total area of EcM host vegetation may also contribute to the higher
   diversity in temperate ecosystems. Our results provide useful
   biogeographic and ecological hypotheses for explaining the distribution
   of fungi that remain to be tested by involving next-generation
   sequencing techniques and relevant soil metadata.}},

Abstract = {{The field of molecular ecology has burgeoned into a large discipline
   spurred on by technical innovations that facilitate the rapid
   acquisition of large amounts of genotypic data, by the continuing
   development of theory to interpret results, and by the availability of
   computer programs to analyse data sets. As the discipline grows,
   however, misconceptions have become enshrined in the literature and are
   perpetuated by routine citations to other articles in molecular ecology.
   These misconceptions hamper a better understanding of the processes that
   influence genetic variation in natural populations and sometimes lead to
   erroneous conclusions. Here, we consider eight misconceptions commonly
   appearing in the literature: (i) some molecular markers are inherently
   better than other markers; (ii) mtDNA produces higher F-ST values than
   nDNA; (iii) estimated population coalescences are real; (iv) more data
   are always better; (v) one needs to do a Bayesian analysis; (vi)
   selective sweeps influence mtDNA data; (vii) equilibrium conditions are
   critical for estimating population parameters; and (viii) having better
   technology makes us smarter than our predecessors. This is clearly not
   an exhaustive list and many others can be added. It is, however,
   sufficient to illustrate why we all need to be more critical of our own
   understanding of molecular ecology and to be suspicious of self-evident
   truths.}},

Abstract = {{One of the pervasive challenges in landscape genetics is detecting gene
   flow patterns within continuous populations of highly mobile wildlife.
   Understanding population genetic structure within a continuous
   population can give insights into social structure, movement across the
   landscape and contact between populations, which influence ecological
   interactions, reproductive dynamics or pathogen transmission. We
   investigated the genetic structure of a large population of deer
   spanning the area of Wisconsin and Illinois, USA, affected by chronic
   wasting disease. We combined multiscale investigation, landscape genetic
   techniques and spatial statistical modelling to address the complex
   questions of landscape factors influencing population structure. We
   sampled over 2000 deer and used spatial autocorrelation and a spatial
   principal components analysis to describe the population genetic
   structure. We evaluated landscape effects on this pattern using a
   spatial autoregressive model within a model selection framework to test
   alternative hypotheses about gene flow. We found high levels of genetic
   connectivity, with gradients of variation across the large continuous
   population of white-tailed deer. At the fine scale, spatial clustering
   of related animals was correlated with the amount and arrangement of
   forested habitat. At the broader scale, impediments to dispersal were
   important to shaping genetic connectivity within the population. We
   found significant barrier effects of individual state and interstate
   highways and rivers. Our results offer an important understanding of
   deer biology and movement that will help inform the management of this
   species in an area where overabundance and disease spread are primary
   concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Colonization is crucial to habitat restoration projects that rely on the

   previously declining plant species spreads again, the likelihood of
   founder effects increases through recurrent population founding and
   associated serial bottlenecks. We related Amplified Fragment Length

   history for all extant populations of the outcrossing terrestrial orchid
   Dactylorhiza incarnata in an isolated coastal dune complex. Around 1970,
   D. incarnata suffered a severe bottleneck yet ultimately persisted and
   gradually spread throughout the spatially segregated dune slacks, aided
   by the restoration of an open vegetation. Genetic assignment
   demonstrated dispersal to vacant sites from few nearby extant
   populations and very limited inflow from outside the spatially isolated
   reserve. Results further indicated that recurrent founding from few
   local sources resulted in the loss of genetic diversity and promoted
   genetic divergence (FST = 0.35) among populations, but did not influence
   population fitness. The few source populations initially available and
   the limited inflow of genes from outside the study reserve, as a
   consequence of habitat degradation and spatial isolation, may have
   magnified the genetic effects of recurrent population founding.}},

Abstract = {{Clonal propagation is considered to be the predominant mode of
   reproduction among many parasitic protozoa. However, this assumption may
   overlook unorthodox, infrequent or cryptic sexuality. Trypanosoma cruzi,
   which causes Chagas disease, is known to undergo non-Mendelian genetic
   exchange in the laboratory. In the field, evidence of extant genetic
   exchange is limited. In this study, we undertook intensive sampling of
   T. cruzi Discrete Typing Unit I in endemic eastern Colombia. Using
   Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we generated 269 biological clones
   from 67 strains. Each clone was genotyped across 24 microsatellite loci.
   Subsequently, 100 representative clones were typed using 10
   mitochondrial sequence targets (3.76 Kbp total). Clonal diversity among
   humans, reservoir hosts and vectors suggested complex patterns of
   superinfection and/or coinfection in oral and vector-borne Chagas
   disease cases. Clonal diversity between mother and foetus in a
   congenital case demonstrates that domestic TcI genotypes are infective
   in utero. Importantly, gross incongruence between nuclear and
   mitochondrial markers is strong evidence for widespread genetic exchange
   throughout the data set. Furthermore, a confirmed mosaic maxicircle
   sequence suggests intermolecular recombination between individuals as a
   further mechanism of genetic reassortment. Finally, robust dating based
   on mitochondrial DNA indicates that the emergence of a widespread
   domestic TcI clade that we now name TcIDOM (formerly TcIa/VENDom)
   occurred 23 000 +/- 12 000 years ago and was followed by population
   expansion, broadly corresponding with the earliest human migration into
   the Americas.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of multiple vectors to the initial
   establishment, spread and population dynamics of invasive species
   remains poorly understood. This study used molecular methods to clarify
   the roles of commercial shipping and recreational boating in the
   invasion by the cosmopolitan tunicate, Botryllus schlosseri. We
   evaluated (i) single vs. multiple introduction scenarios, (ii) the
   relative importance of shipping and boating to primary introductions,
   (iii) the interaction between these vectors for spread (i.e. the
   presence of a shipping-boating network) and (iv) the role of boating in
   determining population similarity. Tunicates were sampled from 26
   populations along the Nova Scotia, Canada, coast that were exposed to
   either shipping (i.e. ports) or boating (i.e. marinas) activities. A
   total of 874 individuals (c. 30 per population) from five ports and 21
   marinas was collected and analysed using both mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and 10 nuclear microsatellite markers. The
   geographical location of multiple hotspot populations indicates that
   multiple invasions have occurred in Nova Scotia. A loss of genetic
   diversity from port to marina populations suggests a stronger influence
   of ships than recreational boats on primary coastal introductions.
   Population genetic similarity analysis reveals a dependence of marina
   populations on those that had been previously established in ports.
   Empirical data on marina connectivity because of boating better explains
   patterns in population similarities than does natural spread. We
   conclude that frequent primary introductions arise by ships and that
   secondary spread occurs gradually thereafter around individual ports,
   facilitated by recreational boating.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and environmental heterogeneity are major factors in structuring
   species distributions in alpine landscapes. These landscapes have also
   been affected by glacial advances and retreats, causing alpine taxa to
   undergo range shifts and demographic changes. These nonequilibrium
   population dynamics have the potential to obscure the effects of
   environmental factors on the distribution of genetic variation. Here, we
   investigate how demographic change and environmental factors influence
   genetic variation in the alpine butterfly Colias behrii. Data from 14
   microsatellite loci provide evidence of bottlenecks in all population
   samples. We test several alternative models of demography using
   approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), with the results favouring a
   model in which a recent bottleneck precedes rapid population growth.
   Applying independent calibrations to microsatellite loci and a nuclear
   gene, we estimate that this bottleneck affected both northern and
   southern populations 531281 years ago, coinciding with a period of
   global cooling. Using regression approaches, we attempt to separate the
   effects of population structure, geographical distance and landscape on
   patterns of population genetic differentiation. Only 40\% of the
   variation in FST is explained by these models, with geographical
   distance and least-cost distance among meadow patches selected as the
   best predictors. Various measures of genetic diversity within
   populations are also decoupled from estimates of local abundance and
   habitat patch characteristics. Our results demonstrate that demographic
   change can have a disproportionate influence on genetic diversity in
   alpine species, contrasting with other studies that suggest landscape
   features control contemporary demographic processes in high-elevation
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Clonal organisms with occasional sex are important for our general
   understanding of the costs and benefits that maintain sexual
   reproduction. Cyclically parthenogenetic aphids are highly variable in
   their frequency of sexual reproduction. However, studies have mostly
   focused on free-living aphids above ground, whereas dispersal
   constraints and dependence on ant-tending may differentially affect the
   costs and benefits of sex in subterranean aphids. Here, we studied
   reproductive mode and dispersal in a community of root aphids that are
   obligately associated with the ant Lasius flavus. We assessed the
   genetic population structure of four species (Geoica utricularia,
   Tetraneura ulmi, Forda marginata and Forda formicaria) in a Dutch
   population and found that all species reproduce predominantly if not
   exclusively asexually, so that populations consist of multiple clonal
   lineages. We show that population viscosity is high and winged aphids
   rare, consistent with infrequent horizontal transmission between ant
   host colonies. The absence of the primary host shrub (Pistacia) may
   explain the absence of sex in three of the studied species, but elm
   trees (Ulmus) that are primary hosts of the fourth species (T. ulmi)
   occurred within a few km of the study population. We discuss the extent
   to which obligate ant-tending and absence of primary hosts may have
   affected selection for permanent parthenogenesis, and we highlight the
   need for further study of these aphids in Southern Europe where primary
   hosts may occur close to L. flavus populations, so that all four root
   aphid species would have realistic opportunities for completing their
   sexual life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{In response to selective pressure, adaptation may follow different
   genetic pathways throughout the natural range of a species due to
   historical differentiation in standing genetic variation. Using 41
   populations of black spruce (Picea mariana), the objectives of this
   study were to identify adaptive genetic polymorphisms related to
   temperature and precipitation variation across the transcontinental
   range of the species, and to evaluate the potential influence of
   historical events on their geographic distribution. Population structure
   was first inferred using 50 control nuclear markers. Then, 47 candidate
   gene SNPs identified in previous genome scans were tested for
   relationship with climatic factors using an FST-based outlier method and
   regressions between allele frequencies and climatic variations. Two main
   intraspecific lineages related to glacial vicariance were detected at
   the transcontinental scale. Within-lineage analyses of allele
   frequencies allowed the identification of 23 candidate SNPs
   significantly related to precipitation and/or temperature variation,
   among which seven were common to both lineages, eight were specific to
   the eastern lineage and eight were specific to the western lineage. The
   implication of these candidate SNPs in adaptive processes was further
   supported by gene functional annotations. Multiple evidences indicated
   that the occurrence of lineage-specific adaptive SNPs was better
   explained by selection acting on historically differentiated gene pools
   rather than differential selection due to heterogeneity of interacting
   environmental factors and pleiotropic effects. Taken together, these
   findings suggest that standing genetic variation of potentially adaptive
   nature has been modified by historical events, hence affecting the
   outcome of recent selection and leading to different adaptive routes
   between intraspecific lineages.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression responds to the environment and can also evolve rapidly
   in response to altered selection regimes. Little is known, however,
   about the extent to which evolutionary adaptation to a particular type
   of stress involves changes in the within-generation (plastic) responses
   of gene expression to the stress. We used microarrays to quantify gene
   expression plasticity in response to ethanol in laboratory populations
   of Drosophila melanogaster differing in their history of ethanol
   exposure. Two populations (R populations) were maintained on regular
   medium, two (E) were maintained on medium supplemented with ethanol, and
   two (M) were maintained in a mixed regime in which half of the
   population was reared on one medium type, and half on the other, each
   generation. After more than 300 generations, embryos from each
   population were collected and exposed to either ethanol or water as a
   control, and RNA was extracted from the larvae shortly after hatching.
   Nearly 2000 transcripts showed significant within-generation responses
   to ethanol exposure. Evolutionary history also affected gene expression:
   the E and M populations were largely indistinguishable in expression,
   but differed significantly in expression from the R populations for over
   100 transcripts, the majority of which did not show plastic responses.
   Notably, in no case was the interaction between selection regime and
   ethanol exposure significant after controlling for multiple comparisons,
   indicating that adaptation to ethanol in the E and M populations did not
   involve substantial changes in gene expression plasticity. The results
   give evidence that expression plasticity evolves considerably more
   slowly than mean expression.}},

Abstract = {{Surprisingly, a high frequency of interspecific sea turtle hybrids has
   been previously recorded in a nesting site along a short stretch of the
   Brazilian coast. Mitochondrial DNA data indicated that as much as 43\%
   of the females identified as Eretmochelys imbricata are hybrids in this
   area (Bahia State of Brazil). It is a remarkable find, because most of
   the nesting sites surveyed worldwide, including some in northern Brazil,
   presents no hybrids, and rare Caribbean sites present no more than 2\%
   of hybrids. Thus, a detailed understanding of the hybridization process
   is needed to evaluate natural or anthropogenic causes of this regional
   phenomenon in Brazil, which could be an important factor affecting the
   conservation of this population. We analysed a set of 12 nuclear markers
   to investigate the pattern of hybridization involving three species of
   sea turtles: hawksbill (E. imbricata), loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and
   olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). Our data indicate that most of the
   individuals in the crossings L. olivacea x E. imbricata and L. olivacea
   x C. caretta are F1 hybrids, whereas C. caretta x E. imbricata crossings
   present F1 and backcrosses with both parental species. In addition, the
   C. caretta x E. imbricata hybridization seems to be gender and species
   biased, and we also found one individual with evidence of multispecies
   hybridization among C. caretta x E. imbricata x Chelonia mydas. The
   overall results also indicate that hybridization in this area is a
   recent phenomenon, spanning at least two generations or 40 years.}},

Abstract = {{The Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis) has established more than 150
   non-native populations in Central Europe, stemming from eight
   geographically distinct evolutionary lineages. While the majority of
   these introduced populations are found outside the native range, some of
   these populations also exist at the northern range margin in
   southwestern Germany. To (i) infer the level of hybridization in contact
   zones of alien and native lineages; and (ii) compare the genetic
   diversity among purebred introduced, native and hybrid populations, we
   used a combination of maternally inherited markers (mtDNA: cytb) and
   Mendelian markers (microsatellites). Our results suggest a rapid genetic
   assimilation of native populations by strong introgression from
   introduced lineages. Discordant patterns of mtDNA and nDNA variation
   within hybrid populations may be explained by directed mate choice of
   females towards males of alien lineages. In contrast to previous
   studies, we found a nonlinear relationship between genetic diversity and
   admixture level. The genetic diversity of hybrid populations was
   substantially higher than in introduced and native populations belonging
   to a single lineage, but rapidly reaching a plateau of high genetic
   diversity at an admixture level of two. However, even introduced
   populations with low founder sizes and from one source population
   retained moderate levels of genetic diversity and no evidence for a
   genetic bottleneck was found. The extent of introgression and the
   dominance of alien haplotypes in mixed populations indicate that
   introductions of non-native lineages represent a serious threat to the
   genetic integrity of native populations due to the rapid creation of
   hybrid swarms.}},

Abstract = {{Australia and New Guinea contain high levels of endemism and
   biodiversity, yet there have been few evaluations of population-level
   genetic diversity in fauna occurring throughout the Australo-Papuan
   region. Using extensive geographical sampling, we examined and compared
   the phylogenetic relationships, phylogeography and population structure
   of Anopheles farauti, An. hinesorum and An. irenicus throughout their
   ranges in the southwest Pacific using mitochondrial (mtDNA COI) and
   nuclear (ribosomal protein S9 and ribosomal DNA ITS2) loci. Phylogenetic
   analyses suggest that the ability to utilize humans as hosts has been
   lost repeatedly, coincident with independent colonizations of the
   Solomon Islands. As some of the species under investigation transmit
   malaria in the region, this is a medically important finding. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of nuclear loci also
   showed that the three species are monophyletic. However, putative
   introgression of An. hinesorum mtDNA onto a nuclear background of An.
   farauti was evident in populations from Queensland, Torres Strait and
   southern New Guinea. Haplotype networks and pairwise FST values show
   that there is significant genetic structure within New Guinea and
   Australia in both An. farauti and An. hinesorum, consistent with a
   long-term history of low gene flow among populations.}},

Abstract = {{The migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, is the most widely distributed
   grasshopper species in the world. However, its global genetic structure
   and phylogeographic relationships have not been investigated. In this
   study, we explored the worldwide genetic structure and phylogeography of
   the locust populations based on the sequence information of 65 complete
   mitochondrial genomes and three mitochondrial genes of 263 individuals
   from 53 sampling sites. Although this locust can migrate over long
   distances, our results revealed high genetic differentiation among the
   geographic populations. The populations can be divided into two
   different lineages: the Northern lineage, which includes individuals
   from the temperate regions of the Eurasian continent, and the Southern
   lineage, which includes individuals from Africa, southern Europe, the
   Arabian region, India, southern China, South-east Asia and Australia. An
   analysis of population genetic diversity indicated that the locust
   species originated from Africa. Ancestral populations likely separated
   into Northern and Southern lineages 895 000 years ago by vicariance
   events associated with Pleistocene glaciations. These two lineages
   evolved in allopatry and occupied their current distributions in the
   world via distinct southern and northern dispersal routes. Genetic
   differences, caused by the long-term independent diversification of the
   two lineages, along with other factors, such as geographic barriers and
   temperature limitations, may play important roles in maintaining the
   present phylogeographic patterns. Our phylogeographic evidence
   challenged the long-held view of multiple subspecies in the locust
   species and tentatively divided it into two subspecies, L. m. migratoria
   and L. m. migratorioides.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interplay of dispersal and how it translates into gene
   flow is key to understanding population processes, and especially so for
   endangered species occupying fragmented habitats. In migratory
   songbirds, there is evidence that long-distance movement capabilities do
   not translate well into observed dispersal. Our objectives were to (i)
   define the fine-scale spatial genetic structure in endangered
   black-capped vireos to characterize dispersal patterns and (ii) to
   correlate dispersal dynamics to overall population genetic structure
   using a simulation approach. We sampled 160 individuals over 2 years to
   (i) describe the fine-scale genetic structuring and (ii) used this
   information to model scenarios to compare with actual data on change in
   population structuring over a 100-year interval. We found that
   black-capped vireos exhibit male philopatry and restricted dispersal
   distances, relative to females. Our simulations also support a
   sex-biased dispersal model. Additionally, we find that fragmentation
   related changes in rates of dispersal might be a likely cause for
   increasing levels of population structure over a 100-year period. We
   show that restricted sex-biased dispersal can explain population
   structuring in this species and that changes in dispersal rates due to
   fragmentation may be a continuing threat to genetic viability in this
   species.}},

   tolerance to a pyrethroid insecticide}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Cotton plants accumulate phytotoxins, including gossypol and related
   sesquiterpene aldehydes, to resist insect herbivores and pathogens. To
   counteract these defensive plant secondary metabolites, cotton bollworms
   (Helicoverpa armigera) elevate their production of detoxification
   enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). Besides their
   tolerance to phytotoxin, cotton bollworms have quickly developed
   resistance to deltamethrin, a widely used pyrethroid insecticide in
   cotton field. However, the relationship between host plant secondary
   metabolites and bollworm insecticide resistance is poorly understood.
   Here, we show that exogenously expressed CYP6AE14, a gossypol-inducible
   P450 of cotton bollworm, has epoxidation activity towards aldrin, an
   organochlorine insecticide, indicating that gossypol-induced P450s
   participate in insecticide metabolism. Gossypol-ingested cotton bollworm
   larvae showed higher midgut P450 enzyme activities and exhibited
   enhanced tolerance to deltamethrin. The midgut transcripts of bollworm
   larvae administrated with different phytochemicals and deltamethrin were
   then compared by microarray analysis, which showed that gossypol and
   deltamethrin induced the most similar P450 expression profiles.
   Gossypol-induced P450s exhibited high divergence and at least five of
   them (CYP321A1, CYP9A12, CYP9A14, CYP6AE11 and CYP6B7) contributed to
   cotton bollworm tolerance to deltamethrin. Knocking down one of them,
   CYP9A14, by plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) rendered the larvae
   more sensitive to the insecticide. These data demonstrate that
   generalist insects can take advantage of secondary metabolites from
   their major host plants to elaborate defence systems against other toxic
   chemicals, and impairing this defence pathway by RNAi holds a potential
   for reducing the required dosages of agrochemicals in pest control.}},

   significant association between spatial proximity of lizard pairs and

Abstract = {{In the context of rising seawater temperatures associated with climate
   change, the issue of whether coral holobionts deal with this challenge
   by shuffling their associations with stress- and/or heat-tolerant
   Symbiodinium, by generating heat-resistant host genotypes, or both is
   important for coral survival. In this study, the composition of
   communities of the endosymbiont Symbiodinium and the population genetics
   of the coral host Platygyra verweyi were examined in a reef impacted by
   hot-water discharged from the outlet of a nuclear power plant in
   operation in Kenting, Southern Taiwan since 1984. The water at this site
   is 2.03.0 degrees C warmer than adjacent reefs in summer, which have an
   average seawater temperature of 29.0 degrees C. The data were compared
   with those for the same species at other sites within 12 km of the
   outlet site. Platygyra verwyei was associated with one or both of
   Symbiodinium types C3 (heat sensitive) and D1a (heat tolerant) at all
   sites with the latter being the dominant at the nuclear power plant
   outlet. The proportion of C3 in populations increased gradually with
   increasing distance from the hot-water discharge. Genetic analysis of
   the Platygyra verweyi host using mitochondrial and nuclear markers
   showed no genetic differentiation among sites. Changes in the
   composition of Symbiodinium types associated with P. verweyi among
   closely located sites in Kenting suggested that this coral might have
   acclimatized to the constant thermal stress by selective association
   with heat-tolerant Symbiodinium types, whereas the role of the host in
   adaptation was inconclusive.}},

Abstract = {{Domesticated rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the worlds most important
   food crops, culturally, nutritionally and economically (Khush 1997).
   Thus, it is no surprise that there is intense curiosity about its
   genetic and geographical origins, its response to selection under
   domestication, and the genetic structure of its wild relative, Oryza
   rufipogon. Studies of Oryza attempting to answer these questions have
   accompanied each stage of the development of molecular markers, starting
   with allozymes and continuing to genome sequencing. While many of these
   studies have been restricted to small sample sizes, in terms of either
   the number of markers used or the number and distribution of the
   accessions, costs are now low enough that researchers are including
   large numbers of molecular markers and accessions. How will these
   studies relate to previous findings and long-held assumptions about rice
   domestication and evolution? If the paper in this issue of Molecular
   Ecology (Huang 2012) is any indication, there will be some considerable
   surprises in store. In this study, a geographically and genomically
   thorough sampling of O.similar to rufipogon and O.similar to sativa
   revealed two genetically distinct groups of wild rice and also indicated
   that only one of these groups appears to be related to domesticated
   rice. While this fits well with previous studies indicating that there
   are genetic subdivisions within O.similar to rufipogon, it stands in
   contrast to previous findings that the two major varieties of O.similar
   to sativa (indica and japonica) were domesticated from two (or more)
   subpopulations of wild rice.}},

Abstract = {{The process of domestication often brings about profound changes in
   levels of genetic variation in animals and plants. The honey bee, Apis
   mellifera, has been managed by humans for centuries for both honey and
   wax production and crop pollination. Human management and selective
   breeding are believed to have caused reductions in genetic diversity in
   honey bee populations, thereby contributing to the global declines
   threatening this ecologically and economically important insect.
   However, previous studies supporting this claim mostly relied on
   population genetic comparisons of European and African (or Africanized)
   honey bee races; such conclusions require reassessment given recent
   evidence demonstrating that the honey bee originated in Africa and
   colonized Europe via two independent expansions. We sampled honey bee
   workers from two managed populations in North America and Europe as well
   as several old-world progenitor populations in Africa, East and West
   Europe. Managed bees had highly introgressed genomes representing
   admixture between East and West European progenitor populations. We
   found that managed honey bees actually have higher levels of genetic
   diversity compared with their progenitors in East and West Europe,
   providing an unusual example whereby human management increases genetic
   diversity by promoting admixture. The relationship between genetic
   diversity and honey bee declines is tenuous given that managed bees have
   more genetic diversity than their progenitors and many viable
   domesticated animals.}},

Abstract = {{Despite taxonomys 250-year history, the past 20 years have borne witness
   to remarkable advances in technology and techniques, as well as debate.
   DNA barcoding has generated a substantial proportion of this debate,
   with its proposition that a single mitochondrial sequence will
   consistently identify and delimit species, replacing more evidence-rich
   and time-intensive methods. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has since
   been the focus of voluminous discussion and case studies, little effort
   has been made to comprehensively evaluate its success in delimiting
   closely related species. We have conducted the first broadly comparative
   literature review addressing the efficacy of molecular markers for
   delimiting such species over a broad taxonomic range. By considering
   only closely related species, we sought to avoid confusion of success
   rates with those due to deeply divergent taxa. We also address whether
   increased population-level or geographic sampling affects delimitation
   success. Based on the results from 101 studies, we found that all marker
   groups had approximately equal success rates (similar to 70\%) in
   delimiting closely related species and that the use of additional loci
   increased average delimitation success. We also found no relationship
   between increased sampling of intraspecific variability and delimitation
   success. Ultimately, our results support a multi-locus integrative
   approach to species delimitation and taxonomy.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The physical and environmental attributes of landscapes often shape
   patterns of population connectivity by influencing dispersal and gene
   flow. Landscape effects on movement are typically evaluated for single
   species. However, inferences from multiple species are required for
   multi-species management strategies increasingly being applied in
   conservation. In this study, I compared the spatial genetic patterns of
   two amphibian species across the northeastern United States and
   estimated the influence of specific landscape features on the observed
   genetic structure. The spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood
   frog (Rana sylvatica) share many ecological attributes related to
   habitat use, phenology and site fidelity. However, I hypothesized that
   important differences in their movement patterns and life history would
   create distinct genetic patterns for each species. Using 14
   microsatellite loci, I tested for differences in the level of genetic
   differentiation between the two species across 22 breeding ponds. The
   effects of eight landscape features were also estimated by evaluating 32
   landscape resistance models. Spotted salamanders exhibited significantly
   higher genetic differentiation than wood frogs. Different landscape
   features were also identified as potential drivers of the genetic
   patterns in each species, with little overlap in model support between
   species. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that these
   two amphibian species interact with the landscape in measurably
   different ways. The distinct genetic patterns observed are consistent
   with key differences in movement ability and life history between A.
   maculatum and R. sylvatica. These results highlight the importance of
   considering more than one species when assessing the impacts of the
   landscape matrix on population connectivity, even for ecologically
   similar species within the same habitats.}},

Number = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Human-associated introduction of pathogens and consequent invasions is
   very evident in areas where no related organisms existed before. In
   areas where related but distinct populations or closely related cryptic
   species already exist, the invasion process is much harder to unravel.
   In this study, the population structure of the Eucalyptus leaf pathogen
   Teratosphaeria nubilosa was studied within its native range in
   Australia, including both commercial plantations and native forests. A
   collection of 521 isolates from across its distribution was
   characterized using eight microsatellite loci, resulting in 112
   multilocus haplotypes (MLHs). Multivariate and Bayesian analyses of the
   population conducted in structure revealed three genetically isolated
   groups (A, B and C), with no evidence for recombination or hybridization
   among groups, even when they co-occur in the same plantation. DNA
   sequence data of the ITS (n = 32), beta-tubulin (n = 32) and 27
   anonymous loci (n = 16) were consistent with microsatellite data in
   suggesting that T. nubilosa should be considered as a species complex.
   Patterns of genetic diversity provided evidence of biological invasions
   by the pathogen within Australia in the states of Western Australia and
   New South Wales and helped unravel the pattern of invasion beyond
   Australia into New Zealand, Brazil and Uruguay. No significant genetic
   differences in pathogen populations collected in native forests and
   commercial plantations were observed. This emphasizes the importance of
   sanitation in the acquisition of nursery stock for the establishment of
   commercial plantations.}},

Abstract = {{Highly mobile marine species in areas with no obvious geographic
   barriers are expected to show low levels of genetic differentiation.
   However, small-scale variation in habitat may lead to resource
   polymorphisms and drive local differentiation by adaptive divergence.
   Using nuclear microsatellite genotyping at 20 loci, and mitochondrial
   control region sequencing, we investigated fine-scale population
   structuring of inshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) inhabiting
   a range of habitats in and around Moreton Bay, Australia. Bayesian
   structure analysis identified two genetic clusters within Moreton Bay,
   with evidence of admixture between them (FST similar to=similar to 0.05,
   P similar to=similar to 0.001). There was only weak isolation by
   distance but one cluster of dolphins was more likely to be found in
   shallow southern areas and the other in the deeper waters of the central
   northern bay. In further analysis removing admixed individuals, southern
   dolphins appeared genetically restricted with lower levels of variation
   (AR similar to=similar to 3.252, p similar to=similar to 0.003) and high
   mean relatedness (r similar to=similar to 0.239) between individuals. In
   contrast, northern dolphins were more diverse (AR similar to=similar to
   4.850, p similar to=similar to 0.009) and were mixing with a group of
   dolphins outside the bay (microsatellite-based STRUCTURE analysis),
   which appears to have historically been distinct from the bay dolphins
   (mtDNA FST similar to=similar to 0.272, P similar to<similar to 0.001).
   This study demonstrates the ability of genetic techniques to expose
   fine-scale patterns of population structure and explore their origins
   and mechanisms. A complex variety of inter-related factors including
   local habitat variation, differential resource use, social behaviour and
   learning, and anthropogenic disturbances are likely to have played a
   role in driving fine-scale population structure among bottlenose
   dolphins in Moreton Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Food-caching birds rely on stored food to survive the winter, and
   spatial memory has been shown to be critical in successful cache
   recovery. Both spatial memory and the hippocampus, an area of the brain
   involved in spatial memory, exhibit significant geographic variation
   linked to climate-based environmental harshness and the potential
   reliance on food caches for survival. Such geographic variation has been
   suggested to have a heritable basis associated with differential
   selection. Here, we ask whether population genetic differentiation and
   potential isolation among multiple populations of food-caching
   black-capped chickadees is associated with differences in memory and
   hippocampal morphology by exploring population genetic structure within
   and among groups of populations that are divergent to different degrees
   in hippocampal morphology. Using mitochondrial DNA and 583 AFLP loci, we
   found that population divergence in hippocampal morphology is not
   significantly associated with neutral genetic divergence or geographic
   distance, but instead is significantly associated with differences in
   winter climate. These results are consistent with variation in a history
   of natural selection on memory and hippocampal morphology that creates
   and maintains differences in these traits regardless of population
   genetic structure and likely associated gene flow.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4498-4513}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Anopheles melas is a brackish waterbreeding member of the Anopheles
   gambiae complex that is distributed along the coast of West Africa and
   is a major malaria vector within its range. Because little is known
   about the population structure of this species, we analysed 15
   microsatellite markers and 1161 bp of mtDNA in 11 A. melas populations
   collected throughout its range. Compared with its sibling species A.
   gambiae, A. melas populations have a high level of genetic
   differentiation between them, representing its patchy distribution due
   to its fragmented larval habitat that is associated with mangroves and
   salt marsh grass. Populations clustered into three distinct groups
   representing Western Africa, Southern Africa and Bioko Island
   populations that appear to be mostly isolated. Fixed differences in the
   mtDNA are present between all three clusters, and a Bayesian clustering
   analysis of the microsatellite data found no evidence for migration from
   mainland to Bioko Island populations, and little migration was evident
   between the Southern to the Western cluster. Surprisingly, mtDNA
   divergence between the three A. melas clusters is on par with levels of
   divergence between other species of the A. gambiae complex, and no
   support for monophyly was observed in a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
   analysis. Finally, an approximate Bayesian analysis of microsatellite
   data indicates that Bioko Island A. melas populations were connected to
   the mainland populations in the past, but became isolated, presumably
   when sea levels rose after the last glaciation period (=10 00011 000
   bp). This study has exposed species-level genetic divergence within A.
   melas and also has implications for control of this malaria vector.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to previous methodological limitations, knowledge about the
   fine-scale distribution of fungal mycelia in decaying logs is limited.
   We investigated fungal communities in decaying Norway spruce logs at
   various spatial scales at two environmentally different locations in
   Sweden. On the basis of 454 pyrosequencing of the ITS2 region of rDNA,
   1914 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected in 353 samples.
   The communities differed significantly among logs, but the physical
   distance between logs was not found to have a significant effect on
   whether fungal communities had any resemblance to each other. Within a
   log, samples that were closer together generally had communities that
   showed more resemblance to each other than those that were further
   apart. OTUs characteristic for particular positions on the logs could be
   identified. In general, these OTUs did not overlap with the most
   abundant OTUs, and their ecological role was often unknown. Only a few
   OTUs were detected in the majority of logs, whereas numerous OTUs were
   rare and present in only one or a few logs. Wood-decaying Basidiomycetes
   were often represented by higher sequence reads in individual logs than
   Ascomycete OTUs, suggesting that Basidiomycete mycelia spread out more
   rapidly when established. OTU richness tended to increase with the decay
   stage of the sample; however, the known wood decayers were most abundant
   in less-decomposed samples. The fungi identified in the logs represented
   different ecological strategies. Our findings differ from previously
   published sporocarp studies, indicating that the highly abundant
   fruiting species may respond to environment in different ways than the
   rest of the fungal community.}},

Abstract = {{The role glucosinolates play in defending plants against phloem feeders
   such as aphids and whiteflies is currently not clear as these herbivores
   may avoid bringing glucosinolates from the phloem sap into contact with
   myrosinase enzymes. Here, we investigated the effects of high levels of
   aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates on life history traits and
   detoxification gene expression in two sibling species, B and Q, of the
   whitefly Bemisia tabaci. High levels of aliphatic glucosinolates
   decreased the average oviposition rate of both species and reduced the
   survival and developmental rate of Q nymphs. High levels of indolic
   glucosinolates decreased the oviposition rate and survival of nymphal
   stages of the B species and the developmental rate of both species.
   Molecular analyses revealed two major asymmetries between the B and Q
   species. First, specific GST genes (BtGST1 and BtGST2) were
   significantly induced during exposure to indolic glucosinolates only in
   Q. This may reflect the genes putative involvement in indolic
   glucosinolates detoxification and explain the species good performance
   on plants accumulating indolic glucosinolates. Second, the constitutive
   expression of eight of the 10 detoxification genes analysed was higher
   in the Q species than in the B species. Interestingly, four of these
   genes were induced in B in response to high levels of glucosinolates. It
   seems, therefore, that the B and Q species differ in their optimal
   defence strategy. B utilizes inducible defences that are profitable if
   the probability of experiencing the stress is small and its severity is
   low, while Q invests significant resources in being always ready for a
   challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Stress responses play an important role in shaping species distributions
   and robustness to climate change. We investigated how stress responses
   alter the contribution of additive genetic variation to gene expression
   during development of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus
   purpuratus, under increased temperatures that model realistic climate
   change scenarios. We first measured gene expression responses in the
   embryos by RNA-seq to characterize molecular signatures of mild, chronic
   temperature stress in an unbiased manner. We found that an increase from
   12 to 18 degrees C caused widespread alterations in gene expression
   including in genes involved in protein folding, RNA processing and
   development. To understand the quantitative genetic architecture of this
   response, we then focused on a well-characterized gene network involved
   in endomesoderm and ectoderm specification. Using a breeding design with
   wild-caught individuals, we measured genetic and geneenvironment
   interaction effects on 72 genes within this network. We found genetic or
   maternal effects in 33 of these genes and that the genetic effects were
   correlated in the network. Fourteen network genes also responded to
   higher temperatures, but we found no significant genotypeenvironment
   interactions in any of the genes. This absence may be owing to an
   effective buffering of the temperature perturbations within the network.
   In support of this hypothesis, perturbations to regulatory genes did not
   affect the expression of the genes that they regulate. Together, these
   results provide novel insights into the relationship between
   environmental change and developmental evolution and suggest that
   climate change may not expose large amounts of cryptic genetic variation
   to selection in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation is a process in which genetic drift and selection cause
   divergence over time. However, there is no rule dictating the time
   required for speciation, and even low levels of gene flow hinder
   divergence, so that taxa may be poised at the threshold of speciation
   for long periods of evolutionary time. We sequenced mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) and eight nuclear introns (nuDNA) to estimate genomic levels of
   differentiation and gene flow between the Eurasian common teal (Anas
   crecca crecca) and the North American green-winged teal (Anas crecca
   carolinensis). These ducks come into contact in Beringia (north-eastern
   Asia and north-western North America) and have probably done so, perhaps
   cyclically, since the PliocenePleistocene transition, 2.6 Ma, when they
   apparently began diverging. They have diagnosable differences in male
   plumage and are 6.9\% divergent in the mtDNA control region, with only 1
   of 58 crecca and 2 of 86 carolinensis having haplotypes grouping with
   the other. Two nuclear loci were likewise strongly structured between
   these teal (Fst = 0.35), but six loci were undifferentiated or only
   weakly structured (Fst = 0.00.06). Gene flow between crecca and
   carolinensis was 1 individual per generation in both directions in
   mtDNA, but was asymmetrical in nuDNA, with 1 and 20 individuals per
   generation immigrating into crecca and carolinensis, respectively. This
   study illustrates that species delimitation using a single marker
   oversimplifies the complexity of the speciation process, and it suggests
   that even with divergent selection, moderate levels of gene flow may
   stall the speciation process short of completion.}},

Abstract = {{The origins of hybrid zones between parapatric taxa have been of
   particular interest for understanding the evolution of reproductive
   isolation and the geographic context of species divergence. One
   challenge has been to distinguish between allopatric divergence
   (followed by secondary contact) versus primary intergradation
   (parapatric speciation) as alternative divergence histories. Here, we
   use complementary phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to
   investigate the recent divergence of two subspecies of Clarkia xantiana
   and the formation of a hybrid zone within the narrow region of sympatry.
   We tested alternative phylogeographic models of divergence using
   approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and found strong support for a
   secondary contact model and little support for a model allowing for gene
   flow throughout the divergence process (i.e. primary intergradation).
   Two independent methods for inferring the ancestral geography of each
   subspecies, one based on probabilistic character state reconstructions
   and the other on palaeo-distribution modelling, also support a model of
   divergence in allopatry and range expansion leading to secondary
   contact. The membership of individuals to genetic clusters suggests
   geographic substructure within each taxon where allopatric and sympatric
   samples are primarily found in separate clusters. We also observed
   coincidence and concordance of genetic clines across three types of
   molecular markers, which suggests that there is a strong barrier to gene
   flow. Taken together, our results provide evidence for allopatric
   divergence followed by range expansion leading to secondary contact. The
   location of refugial populations and the directionality of range
   expansion are consistent with expectations based on climate change since
   the last glacial maximum. Our approach also illustrates the utility of
   combining phylogeographic hypothesis testing with species distribution
   modelling and fine-scale population genetic analyses for inferring the
   geography of the divergence process.}},

Abstract = {{Asian wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that ranges widely across the eastern
   and southern part of Asia is recognized as the direct ancestor of
   cultivated Asian rice (O.similar to sativa). Studies of the geographic
   structure of O.similar to rufipogon, based on chloroplast and low-copy
   nuclear markers, reveal a possible phylogeographic signal of subdivision
   in O.similar to rufipogon. However, this signal of geographic
   differentiation is not consistently observed among different markers and
   studies, with often conflicting results. To more precisely characterize
   the phylogeography of O.similar to rufipogon populations, a genome-wide
   survey of unlinked markers, intensively sampled from across the entire
   range of O.similar to rufipogon is critical. In this study, we surveyed
   sequence variation at 42 genome-wide sequence tagged sites (STS) in 108
   O.similar to rufipogon accessions from throughout the native range of
   the species. Using Bayesian clustering, principal component analysis and
   amova, we conclude that there are two genetically distinct O.similar to
   rufipogon groups, Ruf-I and Ruf-II. The two groups exhibit a clinal
   variation pattern generally from north-east to south-west. Different
   from many earlier studies, Ruf-I, which is found mainly in China and the
   Indochinese Peninsula, shows genetic similarity with one major
   cultivated rice variety, O.similar to satvia indica, whereas Ruf-II,
   mainly from South Asia and the Indochinese Peninsula, is not found to be
   closely related to cultivated rice varieties. The other major cultivated
   rice variety, O.similar to sativa japonica, is not found to be similar
   to either O.similar to rufipogon groups. Our results support the
   hypothesis of a single origin of the domesticated O.similar to sativa in
   China. The possible role of palaeoclimate, introgression and
   migrationdrift balance in creating this clinal variation pattern is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the stability of trophic relationships in complex
   natural communities over evolutionary timescales. Here, we use sequence
   data from 18 nuclear loci to reconstruct and compare the intraspecific
   histories of major Pleistocene refugial populations in the Middle East,
   the Balkans and Iberia in a guild of four Chalcid parasitoids
   (Cecidostiba fungosa, Cecidostiba semifascia, Hobbya stenonota and
   Mesopolobus amaenus) all attacking Cynipid oak galls. We develop a
   likelihood method to numerically estimate models of divergence between
   three populations from multilocus data. We investigate the power of this
   framework on simulated data, andusing triplet alignments of intronic
   lociquantify the support for all possible divergence relationships
   between refugial populations in the four parasitoids. Although an East
   to West order of population divergence has highest support in all but
   one species, we cannot rule out alternative population tree topologies.
   Comparing the estimated times of population splits between species, we
   find that one species, M.similar to amaenus, has a significantly older
   history than the rest of the guild and must have arrived in central
   Europe at least one glacial cycle prior to other guild members. This
   suggests that although all four species may share a common origin in the
   East, they expanded westwards into Europe at different times.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic-alpine biota occupy enormous areas in the Arctic and the northern
   hemisphere mountain ranges and have undergone major range shifts during
   their comparatively short history. The origins of individual
   arctic-alpine species remain largely unknown. In the case of the Purple
   saxifrage, Saxifraga oppositifolia, an important model for arctic-alpine
   plants, phylogeographic studies have remained inconclusive about early
   stages of the species spatiotemporal diversification but have provided
   evidence for long-range colonization out of a presumed Beringian origin
   to cover todays circumpolar range. We re-evaluated the species
   large-scale range dynamics based on a geographically extended sampling
   including crucial areas such as Central Asia and the (south-)eastern
   European mountain ranges and employing up-to-date phylogeographic
   analyses of a plastid sequence data set and a more restricted AFLP data
   set. In accordance with previous studies, we detected two major plastid
   DNA lineages also reflected in AFLP divergence, suggesting a long and
   independent vicariant history. Although we were unable to determine the
   species area of origin, our results point to Europe (probably the Alps)
   and Central Asia, respectively, as the likely ancestral areas of the two
   main lineages. AFLP data suggested that contact areas between the two
   clades in the Carpathians, Northern Siberia and western Greenland were
   secondary. In marked contrast to high levels of diversity revealed in
   previous studies, populations from the major arctic refugium Beringia
   did not exhibit any plastid sequence polymorphism. Our study shows that
   adequate sampling of the southern, refugial populations is crucial for
   understanding the range dynamics of arctic-alpine species.}},

Abstract = {{Both deterministic and stochastic forces determine the representation
   and frequency of floral morphs in heterostylous plant populations.
   Phylogeographic analysis of molecular variation can provide information
   on the role of historical factors, including founder events, in
   affecting population morph structure. Here, we investigate geographical
   patterns of floral morph variation in a distylous shrub Luculia pinceana
   (Rubiaceae) by examining the relations between floral polymorphism and
   molecular (cpDNA and microsatellite) variation in 25 populations sampled
   throughout the distribution of the species in southwest China and
   adjacent countries. In 19 of the 25 populations, the frequency of floral
   morphs was not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio. The
   remaining populations were either L-morph biased (2) or monomorphic (4)
   for this form and were morphologically differentiated from the remaining
   populations in several floral traits, that is, corolla tube length, sex
   organ position and stigma-anther separation. Phylogeographic analysis
   supports the hypothesis that L.similar to pinceana was initially split
   into west-central and eastern lineages in the Early Pleistocene (similar
   to 1.982 Mya). A centrally located lineage composed of morph-biased and
   monomorphic populations appears to have been subsequently derived from
   the west-central lineage, perhaps by a founder event after the last
   glacial maximum. Hypotheses to explain why these populations have not
   returned to equilibrium morph frequencies are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The cultivation of Lepidoptera-resistant Bt-maize may affect nontarget
   butterflies. We assessed the risk posed by event MON89034 x MON88017
   (expressing Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab2 against corn borers) to nontarget
   Lepidoptera. Using the small tortoiseshell Aglais urticae, a butterfly
   species common in central Europe, as a test organism we (i) assessed the
   toxicity of Bt-maize pollen on butterfly larvae; (ii) measured pollen
   deposition on leaves of the host plant Urtica dioica; (iii) mapped the
   occurrence and distribution of host plants and larvae in two arable
   landscapes in Germany during maize anthesis; and (iv) described the
   temporal occurrence of a 1-year population of A.urticae. (i) Larvae-fed
   200 Bt-maize pollen grains/cm2 had a reduced feeding activity.
   Significant differences in developmental time existed at pollen
   densities of 300 Bt-maize pollen grains/cm2 and in survival at 400
   grains/cm2. (ii) The highest pollen amount found was 212 grains/cm2 at
   the field margin. Mean densities were much lower. (iii) In one region,
   over 50\% of A.urticae nests were located within 5 m of a maize field,
   while in the other, all nests were found in more than 25 m distance to a
   maize field. (iv) The percentage of larvae developing during maize
   anthesis was 19\% in the study area. The amount of pollen from maize
   MON89034 x MON88017 found on host plants is unlikely to adversely affect
   a significant proportion of larvae of A.urticae. This paper concludes
   that the risk of event MON89034 x MON88017 to populations of this
   species is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Resolving the paradox of sex, with its twofold cost to genic

   In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Kraaijeveld (2012) describe the
   first genome-scale comparative study of related sexual and asexual
   animal lineages, to test the hypothesis that asexuals bear heavier loads
   of deleterious transposable elements. A much higher density of such
   parasites might be expected, due to the inability of asexual lineages to
   purge transposons via mechanisms exclusive to sexual reproduction. They
   find that the answer is yesand nodepending upon the family of
   transposons considered. Like many such advances in testing theory, more
   questions are raised by this study than answered, but a door has been

Abstract = {{Exotic, invasive pathogens have emerged repeatedly and continue to
   emerge to threaten the worlds forests. Ecosystem structure and function
   can be permanently changed when keystone tree species such as the
   American chestnut (Castanea dentata) are eliminated from a whole range
   by disease. The fungal ascomycete pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica is
   responsible for causing chestnut blight. Once the pathogen was
   introduced into the Eastern US, where chestnuts were predominant,
   chestnuts were all but eliminated. This pathogen is currently causing
   extensive damage in Europe. A study in this issue of Molecular Ecology
   sheds new light on the pattern and process of emergence of this
   devastating plant pathogen (Dutech 2012). The authors used
   microsatellite markers to investigate the evolutionary history of
   C.similar to parasitica populations introduced into North America and
   Europe. To infer sources of migrants and the migration events, the
   authors included putative source populations endemic to China and Japan,
   inferred potentially unsampled populations and conducted a multivariate
   population genetic and complex ABC analysis. Cryphonectria parasitica
   emerges as an example of an introduced pathogen with limited genotypic
   diversity and some admixture in the invaded ranges, yet repeated
   invasions into different areas of Europe and the United States. This
   work sheds new light on the emergence of C.similar to parasitica
   providing compelling evidence that this pathogen emerged by repeated
   migration and occasional admixture.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread occurrence of sex is one of the most elusive problems in
   evolutionary biology. Theory predicts that asexual lineages can be
   driven to extinction by uncontrolled proliferation of vertically
   transmitted transposable elements (TEs), which accumulate because of the
   inefficiency of purifying selection in the absence of sex and
   recombination. To test this prediction, we compared genome-wide TE load
   between a sexual lineage of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes and
   a lineage of the same species that is rendered asexual by
   Wolbachia-induced parthenogenesis. We obtained draft genome sequences at
   1520x coverage of both the sexual and the asexual lineages using
   next-generation sequencing. We identified transposons of most major
   classes in both lineages. Quantification of TE abundance using coverage
   depth showed that copy numbers in the asexual lineage exceeded those in
   the sexual lineage for DNA transposons, but not LTR and LINE-like
   elements. However, one or a small number of gypsy-like LTR elements
   exhibited a fourfold higher coverage in the asexual lineage.
   Quantitative PCR showed that high loads of this gypsy-like TE were
   characteristic for 11 genetically distinct asexual wasp lineages when
   compared to sexual lineages. We found no evidence for an overall
   increase in copy number for all TE types in asexuals as predicted by
   theory. Instead, we suggest that the expansions of specific TEs are best
   explained as side effects of (epi)genetic manipulations of the host
   genome by Wolbachia. Asexuality is achieved in a myriad of ways in
   nature, many of which could similarly result in TE proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Combining nuclear (nuDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers has
   improved the power of molecular data to test phylogenetic and
   phylogeographic hypotheses and has highlighted the limitations of
   studies using only mtDNA markers. In fact, in the past decade, many
   conflicting geographic patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear
   genetic markers have been identified (i.e. mito-nuclear discordance).
   Our goals in this synthesis are to: (i) review known cases of
   mito-nuclear discordance in animal systems, (ii) to summarize the
   biogeographic patterns in each instance and (iii) to identify common
   drivers of discordance in various groups. In total, we identified 126
   cases in animal systems with strong evidence of discordance between the
   biogeographic patterns obtained from mitochondrial DNA and those
   observed in the nuclear genome. In most cases, these patterns are
   attributed to adaptive introgression of mtDNA, demographic disparities
   and sex-biased asymmetries, with some studies also implicating hybrid
   zone movement, human introductions and Wolbachia infection in insects.
   We also discuss situations where divergent mtDNA clades seem to have
   arisen in the absence of geographic isolation. For those cases where
   foreign mtDNA haplotypes are found deep within the range of a second
   taxon, data suggest that those mtDNA haplotypes are more likely to be at
   a high frequency and are commonly driven by sex-biased asymmetries
   and/or adaptive introgression. In addition, we discuss the problems with
   inferring the processes causing discordance from biogeographic patterns
   that are common in many studies. In many cases, authors presented more
   than one explanation for discordant patterns in a given system, which
   indicates that likely more data are required. Ideally, to resolve this
   issue, we see important future work shifting focus from documenting the
   prevalence of mito-nuclear discordance towards testing hypotheses
   regarding the drivers of discordance. Indeed, there is great potential
   for certain cases of mitochondrial introgression to become important
   natural systems within which to test the effect of different
   mitochondrial genotypes on whole-animal phenotypes.}},

   pathogens colonizing new areas, raising the question of the origin of
   clonal lineages. Using microsatellite markers, we retraced the
   evolutionary history of introduction of the chestnut blight fungus,
   Cryphonectria parasitica, in North America and western Europe. Combining
   discriminant analysis of principal components and approximate Bayesian
   computation analysis, we showed that several introduction events from
   genetically differentiated source populations have occurred in both
   invaded areas. In addition, a low signal of genetic recombination among
   different source populations was suggested in North America. Finally,
   two genetic lineages were present in both invaded areas as well as in
   the native areas, suggesting the existence of genetic lineages with a
   high capacity to establish in diverse environments and host species.
   This study confirmed the importance of multiple introductions, but
   questioned the role of genetic admixture in the success of introduction
   of a fungal plant pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Africa is unique among the continents in having maintained an
   extraordinarily diverse and prolific megafauna spanning the
   PleistoceneHolocene epochs. Little is known about the historical
   dynamics of this community and even less about the reasons for its
   unique persistence to modern times. We sequenced complete mitochondrial
   genomes from 43 Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) to infer the
   demographic history of this large mammal. A combination of Bayesian
   skyline plots, simulations and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
   were used to distinguish population size dynamics from the confounding
   effect of population structure and identify the most probable
   demographic scenario. Our analyses revealed a late Pleistocene expansion
   phase concurrent with the human expansion between 80 000 and 10 000
   years ago, refuting an adverse ecological effect of Palaeolithic humans
   on this quarry species, but also showed that the buffalo subsequently
   declined during the Holocene. The distinct two-phased dynamic inferred
   here suggests that a major ecological transition occurred in the
   Holocene. The timing of this transition coincides with the onset of
   drier conditions throughout tropical Africa following the Holocene
   Optimum (similar to 90005000 years ago), but also with the explosive
   growth in human population size associated with the transition from the
   Palaeolithic to the Neolithic cultural stage. We evaluate each of these
   possible causal factors and their potential impact on the African
   megafauna, providing the first systematic assessment of megafauna
   dynamics on the only continent where large mammals remain abundant.}},

Abstract = {{The identification and characterization of reproductively isolated
   subpopulations or stocks are essential for effective conservation and
   management decisions. This can be difficult in vagile marine species
   like marine mammals. We used paternity assignment and gametic recapture
   to examine the reproductive autonomy of southern right whales (Eubalaena
   australis) on their New Zealand (NZ) calving grounds. We derived DNA
   profiles for 34 mothercalf pairs from skin biopsy samples, using
   sex-specific markers, 13 microsatellite loci and mtDNA haplotypes. We
   constructed DNA profiles for 314 adult males, representing 30\% of the
   census male abundance of the NZ stock, previously estimated from
   genotypic mark-recapture modelling to be 1085 (95\% CL 855, 1416). Under
   the hypothesis of demographic closure and the assumption of equal
   reproductive success among males, we predict: (i) the proportion of
   paternities assigned will reflect the proportion of the male population
   sampled and (ii) the gametic markrecapture (GMR) estimate of male
   abundance will be equivalent to the census male estimate for the NZ
   stock. Consistent with these predictions, we found that the proportion
   of assigned paternities equalled the proportion of the census male
   population size sampled. Using the sample of males as the initial
   capture, and paternity assignment as the recapture, the GMR estimate of
   male abundance was 1001 (95\% CL 542, 1469), similar to the male census
   estimate. These findings suggest that right whales returning to the NZ
   calving ground are reproductively autonomous on a generational
   timescale, as well as isolated by maternal fidelity on an evolutionary
   timescale, from others in the Indo-Pacific region.}},

Abstract = {{The deleterious effects of inbreeding are well documented and of major
   concern in conservation biology. Stressful environments have generally
   been shown to increase inbreeding depression; however, little is known
   about the underlying genetic mechanisms of the inbreeding-by-stress
   interaction and to what extent the fitness of individual deleterious
   mutations is altered under stress. Using microsatellite marker
   segregation data and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods, I
   performed a genome scan for deleterious mutations affecting viability
   (viability or vQTL) in two inbred families of the Pacific oyster
   Crassostrea gigas, reared in a stressful, nutrient-poor diet and a
   favourable, nutrient-rich diet, which had significant effects on growth
   and survival. Twice as many vQTL were detected in the stressful diet
   compared with the favourable diet, resulting primarily from
   substantially greater mortality of homozygous genotypes. At vQTL,
   estimates of selection (s) and dominance (h) were greater in the
   stressful environment ( = 0.86 vs. 0.54 and = 0.35 vs. 0.18, in
   stressful and nonstressful diets, respectively). There was no evidence
   of interaction between vQTL. Individual vQTL differed across diets in
   selection only, or in both selection and dominance, and some vQTL were
   not affected by diet. These results suggest that stress-associated
   increases in selection against individual deleterious alleles underlie
   greater inbreeding depression with stress. Furthermore, the finding that
   inbreeding-by-environment interaction appears, to some extent, to be
   locus specific, helps to explain previous observations of
   lineage-specific expression of inbreeding depression and
   environment-specific purging, which have important implications for
   conservation and evolutionary biology.}},

Abstract = {{Hymenopteran species with single-locus complimentary sex-determination
   (sl-CSD) face an additional cost of inbreeding because of a loss of
   diversity at the sex-determining locus. Laboratory studies of a range of
   Hymenoptera have found that a small percentage of diploid males produce
   viable diploid sperm, and that if these males mate, then the resultant
   females produce triploid offspring that are sterile. Here, we use
   microsatellite markers to determine the frequency of triploid
   individuals of Bombus muscorum and B.similar to jonellus in a model
   island system. Triploids were found in populations of both species.
   Observed triploid frequencies of up to 8\% were detected, and estimated
   total frequencies peaked at 20\% with respect to normal diploid workers.
   For both species, triploid frequency was negatively correlated with
   surrogates of population size, providing direct evidence for inbreeding
   in small populations. Populations limited to <similar to 15 km2 of
   suitable habitat were particularly likely to harbour triploids.
   Estimated total triploid frequencies were higher in B.similar to
   muscorum than in B.similar to jonellus, perhaps due to the greater
   dispersal range of the latter species. Implications for the conservation
   of rare social hymenopterans are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetic analyses are typically conducted at one spatial scale.
   Considering multiple scales may be essential for identifying landscape
   features influencing gene flow. We examined landscape connectivity for
   woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) at multiple spatial scales
   using a new approach based on landscape graphs that creates a Voronoi
   tessellation of the landscape. To illustrate the potential of the
   method, we generated five resistance surfaces to explain how landscape
   pattern may influence gene flow across the range of this population. We
   tested each resistance surface using a raster at the spatial grain of
   available landscape data (200 m grid squares). We then used our method
   to produce up to 127 additional grains for each resistance surface. We
   applied a causal modelling framework with partial Mantel tests, where
   evidence of landscape resistance is tested against an alternative
   hypothesis of isolation-by-distance, and found statistically significant
   support for landscape resistance to gene flow in 89 of the 507 spatial
   grains examined. We found evidence that major roads as well as the
   cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbance may be
   contributing to the genetic structure. Using only the original grid
   surface yielded no evidence for landscape resistance to gene flow. Our
   results show that using multiple spatial grains can reveal landscape
   influences on genetic structure that may be overlooked with a single
   grain, and suggest that coarsening the grain of landcover data may be
   appropriate for highly mobile species. We discuss how grains of
   connectivity and related analyses have potential landscape genetic
   applications in a broad range of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics aims to assess the effect of the landscape on
   intraspecific genetic structure. To quantify interdeme landscape
   structure, landscape genetics primarily uses landscape resistance
   surfaces (RSs) and least-cost paths or straight-line transects. However,
   both approaches have drawbacks. Parameterization of RSs is a subjective
   process, and least-cost paths represent a single migration route. A
   transect-based approach might oversimplify migration patterns by
   assuming rectilinear migration. To overcome these limitations, we
   combined these two methods in a new landscape genetic approach:
   least-cost transect analysis (LCTA). Habitat-matrix RSs were used to
   create least-cost paths, which were subsequently buffered to form
   transects in which the abundance of several landscape elements was
   quantified. To maintain objectivity, this analysis was repeated so that
   each landscape element was in turn regarded as migration habitat. The
   relationship between explanatory variables and genetic distances was
   then assessed following a mixed modelling approach to account for the
   nonindependence of values in distance matrices. Subsequently, the best
   fitting model was selected using the statistic. We applied LCTA and the
   mixed modelling approach to an empirical genetic dataset on the
   endangered damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale. We compared the results to
   those obtained from traditional least-cost, effective and resistance
   distance analysis. We showed that LCTA is an objective approach that
   identifies both the most probable migration habitat and landscape
   elements that either inhibit or facilitate gene flow. Although we
   believe the statistical approach to be an improvement for the analysis
   of distance matrices in landscape genetics, more stringent testing is
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Body condition is an important determinant of fitness in many natural
   populations. However, as for many fitness traits, the underlying genes
   that regulate body condition remain elusive. The dopamine receptor D4
   gene (DRD4) is a promising candidate as dopamine is known to play an
   important role in the regulation of food intake and the metabolism of
   both glucose and lipids in vertebrates. In this study, we take advantage
   of a large data set of greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, to test
   whether DRD4 polymorphism predicts early body condition (EBC) while
   controlling for whole-genome effects of inbreeding and outbreeding using
   microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (MLH). We typed 670 of these
   individuals for exon 3 of the homologue of the human DRD4 gene and 10
   microsatellite markers. When controlling for the effects of yearly
   environmental variations and differences between sexes, we found strong
   evidence of an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphisms and EBC,
   with 2.22.3\% of the variation being explained by DRD4 polymorphism,
   whereas there was only weak evidence that MLH predicts EBC. Because EBC
   is most likely a polygenic trait, this is a considerable amount of
   variation explained by a single gene. This is to our knowledge, the
   first study to show an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphism and
   body condition in non-human animals. We anticipate that the DRD4 gene as
   well as other genes coding for neurotransmitters and their receptors may
   play an important role in explaining variation in traits that affect
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, populations of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis)
   have evolved sympatric dwarf and normal ecotypes that are associated
   with distinct trophic niches within lakes. Trophic specialization should
   place diverging physiological demands on individuals, and thus, genes
   and phenotypes associated with energy production represent ideal
   candidates for studies of adaptation. Here, we test for the parallel
   divergence of traits involved in oxygen transport in dwarf and normal
   lake whitefish from Quebec, Canada and Maine, USA. We observed
   significant differences in red blood cell morphology between the
   ecotypes. Specifically, dwarfs exhibited larger nuclei and a higher
   nucleus area/total cell area than normal whitefish in all of the lakes
   examined. In addition, isoelectric focusing gels revealed variation in
   the haemoglobin protein components found in whitefish. Dwarf and normal
   whitefish exhibited a similar number of protein components, but the
   composition of these components differed, with dwarf whitefish bearing a
   greater proportion of cathodic components compared to the normals.
   Furthermore, dwarf whitefish showed significant haemoglobin gene
   upregulation in the brain compared with the levels shown in normals.
   Together, our results indicate that metabolic traits involved in oxygen
   transport differ between the whitefish ecotypes and the strong parallel
   patterns of divergence observed across lakes implicates ecologically
   driven selection pressures. We discuss the function of these traits in
   relation to the differing trophic niches occupied by the whitefish and
   the potential contributions of trait plasticity and genetic divergence
   to energetic adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA barcodes provide a simple taxonomic tool for
   systematic and ecological research, with particular benefit for poorly
   studied or species-rich taxa. Barcoding assumes genetic diversity
   follows species boundaries; however, many processes disrupt
   species-level monophyly of barcodes leading to incorrect
   classifications. Spatial population structure, particularly when shared
   across closely related and potentially hybridizing taxa, can invalidate
   barcoding approaches yet few data exist to examine its impacts. We test
   how shared population structure across hybridizing species impacts upon
   mitochondrial barcodes by sequencing the cytochrome b gene for 518
   individuals of four well-delimited Western Palaearctic gallwasp species
   within the Andricus quercuscalicis species group. Mitochondrial barcodes
   clustered individuals into mixed-species clades corresponding to
   refugia, with no difference in within- and between-species divergence.
   Four nuclear genes were also sequenced from 4 to 11 individuals per
   refugial population of each species. Multi-locus analyses of these data
   supported established species, with no support for the refugial
   clustering across species seen in mitochondrial barcodes. This pattern
   is consistent with mitochondrial introgression among populations of
   species sharing the same glacial refugium, such that mitochondrial
   barcodes identify a shared history of population structure rather than
   species. Many taxa show phylogeographic structure across glacial
   refugia, suggesting that mitochondrial barcoding may fail when applied
   to other sets of co-distributed, closely related species. Robust
   barcoding approaches must sample extensively across population structure
   to disentangle spatial from species-level variation. Methods
   incorporating multiple unlinked loci are also essential to accommodate
   coalescent variation among genes and provide power to resolve recently
   diverged species.}},

Abstract = {{A large portion of the surface-ocean biomass is represented by
   microscopic unicellular plankton. These organisms are functionally and
   morphologically diverse, but it remains unclear how their diversity is
   generated. Species of marine microplankton are widely distributed
   because of passive transport and lack of barriers in the ocean. How does
   speciation occur in a system with a seemingly unlimited dispersal
   potential? Recent studies using planktonic foraminifera as a model
   showed that even among the cryptic genetic diversity within
   morphological species, many genetic types are cosmopolitan, lending
   limited support for speciation by geographical isolation. Here we show
   that the current two-dimensional view on the biogeography and potential
   speciation mechanisms in the microplankton may be misleading. By
   depth-stratified sampling, we present evidence that sibling genetic
   types in a cosmopolitan species of marine microplankton, the planktonic
   foraminifer Hastigerina pelagica, are consistently separated by depth
   throughout their global range. Such strong separation between
   genetically closely related and morphologically inseparable genetic
   types indicates that niche partitioning in marine heterotrophic
   microplankton can be maintained in the vertical dimension on a global
   scale. These observations indicate that speciation along depth
   (depth-parapatric speciation) can occur in vertically structured
   microplankton populations, facilitating diversification without the need
   for spatial isolation.}},

Abstract = {{The Socotra Archipelago is an ancient continental fragment of Gondwanan
   origin and one of the most isolated landforms on Earth and a
   biodiversity hot spot. Yet, the biogeography and evolutionary history of
   its endemic fauna still remain largely overlooked. We investigate the
   origin, tempo and mode of diversification in the Hemidactylus geckos of
   the Socotra Archipelago. Concatenated and multilocus species coalescent
   analyses of Hemidactylus from Arabia and North Africa indicate that the
   Hemidactylus from Socotra do not form a monophyletic group and branch as
   three independent and well-supported clades instead. Both the chronogram
   inferred using the gene tree approach of BEAST and the age-calibrated
   multilocus species tree obtained using {*}BEAST suggest that the origin
   of Hemidactylus from Socotra may have involved a first vicariance event
   that occurred in the Early Miocene, followed by two independent
   transoceanic dispersal events that occurred more recently, during the
   Pliocene. Within Socotra, we analysed patterns of genetic diversity, the
   phylogeography and the demographic history in all seven nonintroduced
   species of Hemidactylus. Results based on two mitochondrial and two
   nuclear loci from 144 individuals revealed complex patterns of
   within-island diversification and high levels of intra-species genetic
   divergence. The interplay of both historical and ecological factors
   seems to have a role in the speciation process of this group of geckos.
   Interestingly, the case of H. forbesii and H. oxyrhinus, which inhabit
   the island of Abd al Kuri with an area of 133 km(2), may represent one
   of the most extreme cases of intra-island speciation in reptiles ever
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Observations on mating behaviours and strategies guide our understanding
   of mating systems and variance in reproductive success. However, the
   presence of cryptic strategies often results in situations where social
   mating system is not reflective of genetic mating system. We present
   such a study of the genetic mating system of a harem-forming bat
   Cynopterus sphinx where harems may not be true indicators of male
   reproductive success. This temporal study using data from six seasons on
   paternity reveals that social harem assemblages do not play a role in
   the mating system, and variance in male reproductive success is lower
   than expected assuming polygynous mating. Further, simulations reveal
   that the genetic mating system is statistically indistinguishable from
   promiscuity. Our results are in contrast to an earlier study that
   demonstrated high variance in male reproductive success. Although an
   outcome of behavioural mating patterns, standardized variance in male
   reproductive success (Im) affects the opportunity for sexual selection.
   To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary implications of
   promiscuity for mammals in general, we compared our estimates of Im and
   total opportunity for sexual selection (Im/If, where If is standardized
   variance in female reproductive success) with those of other known
   promiscuous species. We observed a broad range of Im/If values across
   known promiscuous species, indicating our poor understanding of the
   evolutionary implications of promiscuous mating.}},

Abstract = {{In their invasive ranges, Argentine ant populations often form one
   geographically vast supercolony, genetically and chemically uniform
   within which there is no intraspecific aggression. Here we present
   regional patterns of intraspecific aggression, cuticular hydrocarbons
   (CHCs) and population genetics of 18 nesting sites across Corsica and
   the French mainland. Aggression tests confirm the presence of a third
   European supercolony, the Corsican supercolony, which exhibits moderate
   to high levels of aggression, depending on nesting sites, with the Main
   supercolony, and invariably high levels of aggression with the
   Catalonian supercolony. The chemical analyses corroborated the
   behavioural data, with workers of the Corsican supercolony showing
   moderate differences in CHCs compared to workers of the European Main
   supercolony and strong differences compared to workers of the Catalonian
   supercolony. Interestingly, there were also clear genetic differences
   between workers of the Catalonian supercolony and the two other
   supercolonies at both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, but only very
   weak genetic differentiation between nesting sites of the Corsican and
   Main supercolonies (FST = 0.06). A detailed comparison of the genetic
   composition of supercolonies also revealed that, if one of the last two
   supercolonies derived from the other, it is the Main supercolony that
   derived from the Corsican supercolony rather than the reverse. Overall,
   these findings highlight the importance of conducting more qualitative
   and quantitative analyses of the level of aggression between
   supercolonies, which has to be correlated with genetic and chemical
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal plays a prominent role in most conceptual models of community
   assembly. However, direct measurement of dispersal across a whole
   community is difficult at ecologically relevant spatial scales. For
   cryptic organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, the scale and importance
   of dispersal limitation has become a major point of debate. We use an
   experimental island biogeographic approach to measure the effects of
   dispersal limitation on the ecological dynamics of an important group of
   plant symbionts, ectomycorrhizal fungi. We manipulated the isolation of
   uncolonized host seedlings across a natural landscape and used a range
   of molecular techniques to measure the dispersal rates of
   ectomycorrhizal propagules and host colonization. Some species were
   prolific dispersers, producing annual spore loads on the order of
   trillions of spores per km2. However, fungal propagules reaching host
   seedlings decreased rapidly with increasing distance from potential
   spore sources, causing a concomitant reduction in ectomycorrhizal
   species richness, host colonization and host biomass. There were also
   strong differences in dispersal ability across species, which correlated
   well with the predictable composition of ectomycorrhizal communities
   associated with establishing pine forest. The use of molecular tools to
   measure whole community dispersal provides a direct confirmation for a
   key mechanism underlying island biogeography theory and has the
   potential to make microbial systems a model for understanding the role
   of dispersal in ecological theory.}},

Abstract = {{We empirically tested the long-standing hypothesis of codivergence of
   New World arenaviruses (NWA) with their hosts. We constructed
   phylogenies for NWA and all known hosts and used them in reconciliation
   analyses. We also constructed a phylogenetic tree of all Sigmodontinae
   and Neotominae rodents and tested whether viralhost associations were
   phylogenetically clustered. We determined host geographical overlap to
   determine to what extent opportunity to switch hosts was limited by host
   relatedness or physical proximity. With the exception of viruses from
   North America, no phylogenetically codivergent pattern between NWA and
   their hosts was found. We found that different virus clades were
   clustered differently and that Clade B with members pathogenic to humans
   was randomly distributed across the rodent phylogeny. Furthermore, viral
   relatedness within Clade B was significantly explained by the geographic
   overlap of their hosts ranges rather than host relatedness, indicating
   that they are capable of host switching opportunistically. This has
   important bearings on their potential to become panzootic. Together,
   these analyses suggest that NWA have not codiverged with their hosts and
   instead have evolved predominantly via host switching.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities are having a deleterious effect on
   biodiversity. To understand the magnitude of this issue, and ultimately
   temper its pace, requires reproducible biodiversity measurements at
   suitable spatio-temporal scales. Procuring such data solely by existing
   approaches is unachievable because of the costs, time and the taxonomic
   expertise required. High-throughput molecular biodiversity analysis
   shows great promise, increasing the breadth of biota sampled and
   accelerating the rate of data collection. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Yoccoz et al. (2012) use short informative DNA product
   meta-barcodes to provide an insight into above-ground vascular plant
   diversity from boreal, temperate and tropical environments.
   Interestingly, their molecular analysis was derived from the soils and
   not the plants themselves, with the molecular signatures of the soils
   not only strongly reflecting current diversity, but also traces of crops
   not sown for up to one hundred years. Importantly, the research examines
   the complexities associated with deriving biomass estimates from
   molecular data and the need to consider biomass turnover. The use of
   soil-derived meta-barcodes extends beyond estimating vascular plant
   diversity, with the approach being suited to the range of ecological
   applications, especially scenarios where DNA may be degraded.}},

Abstract = {{Since Darwins pioneering research on plant reproductive biology (e.g.
   Darwin 1877), understanding the mechanisms maintaining the diverse
   sexual strategies of plants has remained an important challenge for
   evolutionary biologists. In some species, populations are sexually
   polymorphic and contain two or more mating morphs (sex phenotypes).
   Differences in morphology or phenology among the morphs influence
   patterns of non-random mating. In these populations, negative
   frequency-dependent selection arising from disassortative (intermorph)
   mating is usually required for the evolutionary maintenance of sexual
   polymorphism, but few studies have demonstrated the required patterns of
   non-random mating. In the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Shang
   (2012) make an important contribution to our understanding of how
   disassortative mating influences sex phenotype ratios in Acer pictum
   subsp. mono (painted maple), a heterodichogamous, deciduous tree of
   eastern China. They monitored sex expression in 97 adults and used
   paternity analysis of open-pollinated seed to examine disassortative
   mating among three sex phenotypes. Using a deterministic pollen transfer
   model, Shang et similar to al. present convincing evidence that
   differences in the degree of disassortative mating in progeny arrays of
   the sex phenotypes can explain their uneven frequencies in the adult
   population. This study provides a useful example of how the deployment
   of genetic markers, demographic monitoring and modelling can be
   integrated to investigate the maintenance of sexual diversity in plants.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems across the globe are threatened by climate change and human
   activities. New rapid survey approaches for monitoring biodiversity
   would greatly advance assessment and understanding of these threats.
   Taking advantage of next-generation DNA sequencing, we tested an
   approach we call metabarcoding: high-throughput and simultaneous taxa
   identification based on a very short (usually <100 base pairs) but
   informative DNA fragment. Short DNA fragments allow the use of degraded
   DNA from environmental samples. All analyses included amplification
   using plant-specific versatile primers, sequencing and estimation of
   taxonomic diversity. We tested in three steps whether degraded DNA from
   dead material in soil has the potential of efficiently assessing
   biodiversity in different biomes. First, soil DNA from eight boreal
   plant communities located in two different vegetation types (meadow and
   heath) was amplified. Plant diversity detected from boreal soil was
   highly consistent with plant taxonomic and growth form diversity
   estimated from conventional above-ground surveys. Second, we assessed
   DNA persistence using samples from formerly cultivated soils in
   temperate environments. We found that the number of crop DNA sequences
   retrieved strongly varied with years since last cultivation, and crop
   sequences were absent from nearby, uncultivated plots. Third, we
   assessed the universal applicability of DNA metabarcoding using soil
   samples from tropical environments: a large proportion of species and
   families from the study site were efficiently recovered. The results
   open unprecedented opportunities for large-scale DNA-based biodiversity
   studies across a range of taxonomic groups using standardized
   metabarcoding approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The savannah biome of sub-Saharan Africa harbours the highest diversity
   of ungulates (hoofed mammals) on Earth. In this review, we compile
   population genetic data from 19 codistributed ungulate taxa of the
   savannah biome and find striking concordance in the phylogeographic
   structuring of species. Data from across taxa reveal distinct regional
   lineages, which reflect the survival and divergence of populations in
   isolated savannah refugia during the climatic oscillations of the
   Pleistocene. Data from taxa across trophic levels suggest distinct
   savannah refugia were present in West, East, Southern and South-West
   Africa. Furthermore, differing Pleistocene evolutionary biogeographic
   scenarios are proposed for East and Southern Africa, supported by
   palaeoclimatic data and the fossil record. Environmental instability in
   East Africa facilitated several spatial and temporal refugia and is
   reflected in the high inter- and intraspecific diversity of the region.
   In contrast, phylogeographic data suggest a stable, long-standing
   savannah refuge in the south.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding dispersal patterns, population structure and connectivity
   among populations is helpful in the management and conservation of
   threatened species. Molecular markers are useful tools as indirect
   estimators of these characteristics. In this study, we assess the
   population genetic structure of the orange coral Astroides calycularis
   in the Alboran Sea at local and regional scale, and at three localities
   outside of this basin. Bayesian clustering methods, traditional
   F-statistics and Dest statistics were used to determine the patterns of
   genetic structure. Likelihood and coalescence approaches were used to
   infer migration patterns and effective population sizes. The results
   obtained reveal a high level of connectivity among localities separated
   by as much as 1 km and moderate levels of genetic differentiation among
   more distant localities, somewhat corresponding with a stepping-stone
   model of gene flow and connectivity. These data suggest that
   connectivity among populations of this coral is mainly driven by the
   biology of the species, with low dispersal abilities; in addition,
   hydrodynamic processes, oceanographic fronts and the distribution of
   rocky substrate along the coastline may influence larval dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{High gene flow is considered the norm for most marine organisms and is
   expected to limit their ability to adapt to local environments. Few
   studies have directly compared the patterns of differentiation at
   neutral and selected gene loci in marine organisms. We analysed a
   transcriptome-derived panel of 281 SNPs in Atlantic herring (Clupea
   harengus), a highly migratory small pelagic fish, for elucidating
   neutral and selected genetic variation among populations and to identify
   candidate genes for environmental adaptation. We analysed 607
   individuals from 18 spawning locations in the northeast Atlantic,
   including two temperature clines (512 degrees C) and two salinity clines
   (535 parts per thousand). By combining genome scan and landscape genetic
   analyses, four genetically distinct groups of herring were identified:
   Baltic Sea, BalticNorth Sea transition area, North Sea/British Isles and
   North Atlantic; notably, samples exhibited divergent clustering patterns
   for neutral and selected loci. We found statistically strong evidence
   for divergent selection at 16 outlier loci on a global scale, and
   significant correlations with temperature and salinity at nine loci. On
   regional scales, we identified two outlier loci with parallel patterns
   across temperature clines and five loci associated with temperature in
   the North Sea/North Atlantic. Likewise, we found seven replicated
   outliers, of which five were significantly associated with low salinity
   across both salinity clines. Our results reveal a complex pattern of
   varying spatial genetic variation among outlier loci, likely reflecting
   adaptations to local environments. In addition to disclosing the fine
   scale of local adaptation in a highly vagile species, our data emphasize
   the need to preserve functionally important biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The intra- and interspecific diversity of avian beak morphologies is one
   of the most compelling examples for the power of natural selection
   acting on a morphological trait. The development and diversification of
   the beak have also become a textbook example for evolutionary
   developmental biology, and variation in expression levels of several
   genes is known to causally affect beak shape. However, until now, no
   genomic polymorphisms have been identified, which are related to beak
   morphology in birds. QTL mapping does reveal the location of causal
   polymorphisms, albeit with poor spatial resolution. Here, we estimate
   heritability and genetic correlations for beak length, depth and width
   and perform a QTL linkage analysis for these traits based on 1404
   informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in a
   four-generation pedigree of 992 captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata). Beak size, relative to body size, was sexually dimorphic
   (larger in males). Heritability estimates ranged from 0.47 for beak
   length to 0.74 for beak width. QTL mapping revealed four to five regions
   of significant or suggestive genome-wide linkage for each of the three
   beak dimensions (nine different regions in total). Eight out of 11 genes
   known to influence beak morphology are located in these nine peak
   regions. Five QTL do not cover known candidates demonstrating that yet
   unknown genes or regulatory elements may influence beak morphology in
   the zebra finch.}},

Abstract = {{Why do populations remain genetically variable despite strong continuous
   natural selection? Mutation reconstitutes variation eliminated by
   selection and genetic drift, but theoretical and experimental studies
   each suggest that mutation-selection balance insufficient to explain
   extant genetic variation in most complex traits. The alternative
   hypothesis of balancing selection, wherein selection maintains genetic
   variation, is an aggregate of multiple mechanisms (spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity in selection, frequency-dependent selection, antagonistic
   pleiotropy, etc.). Most of these mechanisms have been demonstrated for
   Mendelian traits, but there is little comparable data for loci affecting
   quantitative characters. Here, we report a 3-year field study of
   selection on intrapopulation quantitative trait loci (QTL) of flower
   size, a highly polygenic trait in Mimulus guttatus. The QTL exhibit
   antagonistic pleiotropy: alleles that increase flower size, reduce
   viability, but increase fecundity. The magnitude and direction of
   selection fluctuates yearly and on a spatial scale of metres. This study
   provides direct evidence of balancing selection mechanisms on QTL of an
   ecologically relevant trait.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying adaptive genetic variation is a challenging task, in
   particular in non-model species for which genomic information is still
   limited or absent. Here, we studied distribution patterns of amplified
   fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in response to environmental
   variation, in 13 alpine plant species consistently sampled across the
   entire European Alps. Multiple linear regressions were performed between
   AFLP allele frequencies per site as dependent variables and two
   categories of independent variables, namely Morans eigenvector map MEM
   variables (to account for spatial and unaccounted environmental
   variation, and historical demographic processes) and environmental
   variables. These associations allowed the identification of 153 loci of
   ecological relevance. Univariate regressions between allele frequency
   and each environmental factor further showed that loci of ecological
   relevance were mainly correlated with MEM variables. We found that
   precipitation and temperature were the best environmental predictors,
   whereas topographic factors were rarely involved in environmental
   associations. Climatic factors, subject to rapid variation as a result
   of the current global warming, are known to strongly influence the fate
   of alpine plants. Our study shows, for the first time for a large number
   of species, that the same environmental variables are drivers of plant
   adaptation at the scale of a whole biome, here the European Alps.}},

Title = {{Pleistocene speciation with and without gene flow in Euphaea damselflies

Abstract = {{Climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene period could have had a
   profound impact on the origin of tropical species by the alternation of
   allopatric isolation and interpopulation gene flow cycles. However,
   whether tropical speciation involves strictly allopatric isolation, or
   proceeds in the face of homogenizing gene flow, is relatively unclear.
   Here, we investigated geographical modes of speciation in four closely
   related Euphaea damselfly species endemic to the subtropical and
   tropical East Asian islands using coalescent analyses of a multilocus
   data set. The reconstructed phylogenies demonstrated distinct species
   status for each of the four species and the existence of two sister
   species pairs, Euphaea formosa/E.similar to yayeyamana and E.similar to
   decorata/E.similar to ornata. The species divergence time of the sibling
   Euphaea damselflies dates back to within the last one Mya of the Middle
   to Lower Pleistocene. The speciation between the populous E.similar to
   formosa of Taiwan and the less numerous E.similar to yayeyamana of the
   Yaeyama islands occurred despite significant bidirectional, asymmetric
   gene flow, which is strongly inconsistent with a strictly allopatric
   model. In contrast, speciation of the approximately equal-sized
   populations of E.similar to decorata of the southeast Asian mainland and
   E.similar to ornata of Hainan is inferred to have involved allopatric
   divergence without gene flow. Our findings suggest that differential
   selection of natural or sexual environments is a prominent driver of
   species divergence in subtropical E.similar to formosa and E.similar to
   yayeyamana; whereas for tropical E.similar to decorata and E.similar to
   ornata at lower latitudes, allopatric isolation may well be a pivotal
   promoter of species formation.}},

Abstract = {{A central goal of phylogeography is to identify and characterize the
   processes underlying divergence. One of the biggest impediments
   currently faced is how to capture the spatiotemporal dynamic under which
   a species evolved. Here, we described an approach that couples species
   distribution models (SDMs), demographic and genetic models in a
   spatiotemporally explicit manner. Analyses of American Pika (Ochotona
   princeps) from the sky islands of the central Rocky Mountains of North
   America are used to provide insights into key questions about
   integrative approaches in landscape genetics, population genetics and
   phylogeography. This includes (i) general issues surrounding the
   conversion of time-specific SDMs into simple continuous, dynamic
   landscapes from past to current, (ii) the utility of SDMs to inform
   demographic models with deme-specific carrying capacities and migration
   potentials as well as (iii) the contribution of the temporal dynamic of
   colonization history in shaping genetic patterns of contemporary
   populations. Our results support that the inclusion of a spatiotemporal
   dynamic is an important factor when studying the impact of
   distributional shifts on patterns of genetic data. Our results also
   demonstrate the utility of SDMs to generate species-specific predictions
   about patterns of genetic variation that account for varying degrees of
   habitat specialization and life history characteristics of taxa.
   Nevertheless, the results highlight some key issues when converting SDMs
   for use in demographic models. Because the transformations have direct
   effects on the genetic consequence of population expansion by
   prescribing how habitat heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variation is
   related to the species-specific demographic model, it is important to
   consider alternative transformations when studying the genetic
   consequences of distributional shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent studies on invertebrates have shown how morphology not
   always captures the true diversity of taxa, with cryptic speciation
   often being discussed in this context. Here, we show how diversification
   patterns can be very different in two clades of closely related
   earthworms in the genus Hormogaster stressing the risk of using
   nonspecific substitution rate values across taxa. On the one hand, the
   Hormogaster elisae species complex, endemic to the central Iberian
   Peninsula, shows morphological stasis. On the other hand, a clade of
   Hormogaster from the NE Iberian Peninsula shows an enormous
   morphological variability, with 15 described morphospecies. The
   H.similar to elisae complex, however, evolves faster genetically, and
   this could be explained by the harsher environmental conditions to which
   it is confinedas detected in this study, that is, sandier and slightly
   poorer soils with lower pH values than those of the other species in the
   family. These extreme conditions could be at the same time limiting
   morphological evolution and thus be responsible for the observed
   morphological stasis in this clade. Contrarily, Hormogaster species from
   the NE Iberian Peninsula, although still inhabiting harsher milieu than
   other earthworm groups, have had the opportunity to evolve into a
   greater morphological disparity. An attempt to delimit species within
   this group following the recently proposed general mixed Yule-coalescent
   method showed a higher number of entities than expected under the
   morphospecies concept, most probably due to the low vagility of these
   animals, which considerably limits gene flow between distant conspecific
   populations, but also because of the decoupling between morphological
   and genetic evolution in the H.similar to elisae complex.}},

Abstract = {{Two groups of subspecies of the door snail Charpentieria itala are
   distributed in a mosaic pattern in the Southern Alps. Some subspecies
   that morphologically resemble Charpentieria stenzii occur at exposed
   rocks at higher altitudes, whereas other subspecies live on more humid
   rocks at lower altitudes. This pattern can be explained by two
   alternative hypotheses. Either the stenzii-like or stenzioid subspecies
   have a common origin and represent relicts of an early colonization wave
   that survived the ice ages in isolated mountain refuges within the Alps,
   or the geographically isolated stenzioid subspecies evolved through
   parallel adaptation of C.similar to itala populations to life on exposed
   rocks. In this study, the first hypothesis could be supported by several
   lines of evidence. Analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms
   (AFLP) data indicated a common origin of the stenzioid subspecies of the
   Bergamasque Prealps and of the stenzioid subspecies of the Brescia and
   Garda Prealps, whereas an outlier analysis detected only few AFLP
   markers that might be under selection. High 16S rDNA distances between
   subspecies suggest that the divergence of the subspecies predates at
   least most of the glacials. The occurrences of the stenzioid subspecies
   are concentrated in mountain areas that were not glaciated during the
   Last Glacial Maximum. The genetic differentiation and the isolated
   distribution areas of the stenzioid subspecies indicate that they
   survived in five separate mountain refuges in the Bergamasque, Brescia
   and Garda Prealps. In addition, the clustering of the Charpentieria
   itala latestriata populations from different valleys indicates a
   low-altitude refuge.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying explicit hypotheses regarding the factors determining
   genetic structuring within species can be difficult, especially in
   species distributed in historically dynamic regions. To contend with
   these challenges, we use a framework that combines species distribution
   models, environmental data and multi-locus genetic data to generate and
   explore phylogeographic hypotheses for reptile species occupying the
   coastal sand-dune and sand-plain habitats of the south-western
   Australian biodiversity hotspot, a community which has both a high
   diversity of endemics and has varied dramatically in spatial extent over
   time. We use hierarchical amova, summary statistic and distance-based
   analyses to explicitly test specific phylogeographic hypotheses. Namely,
   we test if biogeographic vicariance across barriers, habitat stability,
   population isolation along a linear habitat or fragmentation across
   different environments can explain genetic divergence within five
   co-distributed squamate reptile species. Our results show that patterns
   of genetic variation reflect complex and species-specific interactions
   related to the spatial distribution of habitats present currently and
   during repeated glacial minima, as opposed to being associated with
   historical factors such as habitat stability between glacial and
   inter-glacial periods or vicariant barriers. We suggest that the large
   impact of habitat characteristics over time (i.e. relative levels of
   habitat connectivity, climatic gradients and spatial heterogeneity of
   soil types) reflects the ecological restrictions of the sand-dune and
   sand-plain reptile communities and may explain the lack of concordance
   across taxa. The study demonstrates the general utility of the approach
   for assemblage-level, as well as single species, phylogeographic study,
   including its usefulness for exploring biologically informed hypotheses
   about what factors have influenced patterns of genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the biogeographic history of Kalopanax septemlobus, one
   of the most widespread temperate tree species in East Asia, using a
   combined phylogeographic and palaeodistribution modelling approach.
   Range-wide genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellites (G'ST =
   0.709; 2205 samples genotyped at five loci) and chloroplast DNA (GST =
   0.697; 576 samples sequenced for 2055 bp at three fragments) was high. A
   major phylogeographic break in Central China corresponded with those of
   other temperate species and the spatial delineation of the two temperate
   forest subkingdoms of East Asia, consistent with the forests having been
   isolated within both East and West China for multiple
   glacialinterglacial cycles. Evidence for multiple glacial refugia was
   found in most of its current range in China, South Japan and the
   southernmost part of the Korean Peninsula. In contrast, lineage
   admixture and absence of private alleles and haplotypes in Hokkaido and
   the northern Korean Peninsula support a postglacial origin of
   northernmost populations. Although palaeodistribution modelling
   predicted suitable climate across a land-bridge extending from South
   Japan to East China during the Last Glacial Maximum, the genetic
   differentiation of regional populations indicated a limited role of the
   exposed sea floor as a dispersal corridor at that time. Overall, this
   study provides evidence that differential impacts of Quaternary climate
   oscillation associated with landscape heterogeneity have shaped the
   genetic structure of a wide-ranging temperate tree in East Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the remarkably high species diversity and levels of
   endemism found among Madagascars flora and fauna has been the focus of
   many studies. One hypothesis that has received much attention proposes
   that Quaternary climate fluctuations spurred diversification. While
   spatial patterns of distribution and phylogenetic relationships can
   provide support for biogeographic predictions, temporal estimates of
   divergence are required to determine the fit of these geospatial
   patterns to climatic or biogeographic mechanisms. We use multilocus DNA
   sequence data to test whether divergence times among Malagasy iguanid
   lizards of the subfamily Oplurinae are compatible with a hypotheses of
   PliocenePleistocene diversification. We estimate the oplurine species
   tree and associated divergence times under a relaxed-clock model. In
   addition, we examine the phylogeographic structure and population
   divergence times within two sister species of Oplurus primarily
   distributed in the north-west and south-west of Madagascar (Oplurus
   cuvieri and Oplurus cyclurus, respectively). We find that divergence
   events among oplurine lineages occurred in the Oligocene and Miocene and
   are thus far older and incompatible with the hypothesis that recent
   climate fluctuations are related to current species diversity. However,
   the timing of intraspecific divergences and spatial patterns of
   population genetic structure within O.similar to cuvieri and O.similar
   to cyclurus suggest a role for both intrinsic barriers and recent
   climate fluctuations at population-level divergences. Integrating
   information across spatial and temporal scales allows us to identify and
   better understand the mechanisms generating patterns diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial biogeography studies expend much effort in determining whether
   environmental selection or stochastic processes related to dispersal are
   more important in shaping community composition. While both types of
   factors are possibly influential, it is tacitly assumed that protists,
   or microbial eukaryotes in general, behave biogeographically as
   prokaryotes because of their small physical size. However, direct
   evidence for this in exactly the same environment and at the same
   phylogenetic depth is lacking. In this study, we compared the structure
   of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic components of microbial communities
   forming biofilms on mineral substrates in different geographic locations
   at the level of small-subunit (SSU) rRNA-based operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs). These microbial communities are subjected to strong
   environmental selection and contain significant proportions of
   extremophilic microorganisms adapted to desiccation and UV radiation. We
   find that the nature of the substrate as well as climatic variables and
   geography influences microbial community structure. However, constrained
   correspondence analyses and distancedecay curves showed that, whereas
   the substrate type was the most significant factor structuring bacterial
   communities, geographic location was the most influential factor for
   microbial eukaryote communities. Biological explanations implying a
   higher dispersal success for bacteria combined with more mobile
   lifestyles for predatory protists may underlie these different
   prokaryote versus microbial eukaryote biogeographic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Acer species often contain more than three sex phenotypes
   with complex sexual polymorphism including duodichogamy, protandry and
   protogyny. We identified the mechanisms that maintain sexual
   polymorphism in Acer pictum subsp. mono, a temperate tree from northern
   China, by investigating maternal mating patterns and male reproductive
   success. We used paternity analyses to estimate rates of outcrossing and
   disassortative mating, as well as male outcrossed siring success, in a
   population of A.similar to pictum subsp. mono with uneven sex phenotype
   ratios (duodichogamous 69.1\%, protandrous 19.6\%, protogynous 11.3\%).
   We used a pollen-transfer model to investigate whether the unequal
   ratios of sex phenotypes could be explained by the observed patterns of
   mating. Most progeny resulted from outcrossing, particularly
   disassortative among the sex phenotypes. Although the duodichogamous
   phenotype showed a significant amount of intraphenotypic mating, the
   frequency did not exceed that of disassortative mating. We detected no
   significant differences in male outcrossed siring success among the sex
   phenotypes. The pollen-transfer model demonstrated that sex phenotype
   ratios could be maintained by the observed mating pattern in the
   population. Our results indicate that disassortative mating among the
   sex phenotypes can maintain sexual polymorphism in A.similar to pictum
   subsp. mono and that ratios biased towards duodichogamy can result from
   frequent intraphenotypic mating in this phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how reproductive barriers evolve during speciation remains
   an important question in evolution. Divergence in mating preferences may
   be a common first step in this process. The striking colour pattern
   diversity of strawberry dart frog (Dendrobates pumilio) populations has
   likely been shaped by sexual selection. Previous laboratory studies have
   shown that females attend to male coloration and prefer to court with
   males of their own colour, suggesting that divergent morphs may be
   reproductively isolated. To test this hypothesis, we used molecular data
   to estimate pedigree relationships from a polymorphic population.
   Whereas in the laboratory both red and yellow females preferred to court
   with males of their own phenotype, our pedigree shows a pattern of
   assortative mating only for red females. In the wild, yellow females
   appear to be less choosy about their mates, perhaps because they incur
   higher costs associated with searching than females of the more common
   red phenotype. We also used our pedigree to investigate the genetic
   basis for colour-pattern variation. The phenotype frequencies we
   observed were consistent with those expected if dorsal background
   coloration is controlled by a single locus, with complete dominance of
   red over yellow. Our results not only help clarify the role of sexual
   selection in reducing gene flow, but also shed light on the mechanisms
   underlying colour-pattern variation among sympatric colour morphs. The
   difference we observed between mating preferences measured under
   laboratory conditions and the pattern of mate choice observed in the
   wild highlight the importance of field studies for understanding
   behavioural reproductive isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Woolly mammoths, Mammuthus primigenius, are arguably the most iconic of
   the extinct Pleistocene megafauna, and an abundance of large
   permafrost-embedded bone and ivory material (Fig. 1) means they were
   also among the first to yield credible DNA sequences (Hagelberg 1994;
   Hoss 1994). Despite mammoth remains being numerous throughout northern
   Eurasia and North America, both the earliest and most recent fossils are
   found in northeast Siberia, with the last known population being
   confined to Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean from around 10,000 years
   ago until their extinction around 4,000 years ago. The extent to which
   these Holocene mammoths were descended from the Pleistocene populations
   of Wrangel Island and the demographic nature of their terminal decline
   have, until now, remained something of a mystery. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Nystrom (2012) report the first use of autosomal
   variation to track the decline of the last mammoths and, in doing so,
   take a significant step towards resolving these questions. The authors
   genotyped four microsatellite loci in 59 Pleistocene and Holocene
   mammoths from Wrangel Island and Chukotka in mainland northeastern
   Siberia and showed that while the Pleistocene-to-Holocene transition is
   associated with a significant reduction in genetic diversity, subsequent
   levels of variation remain constant until extinction. Such a pattern is
   somewhat surprising as it indicates that while the last mammoths were
   confined to only a few Arctic islands, their final extinction on Wrangel
   Island was not a gradual process resulting from loss of genetic
   diversity/inbreeding. Instead, it seems they maintained a viable
   effective population size of around 500 until near their presumably
   rapid extinction. While the ultimate agent of mammoth extinction remains
   unknown, the work of Nystrom (2012). suggests that we should be looking
   for something sudden, like a rapid change in climate/ecology or perhaps
   the arrival of humans. 1 Sergey Vartanyan during field collection,

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly clear that local adaptation can occur even
   in the face of high gene flow and limited overall genomic
   differentiation among populations (reviewed by Nosil 2009). Thus, one
   important task for molecular ecologists is to sift through genomic data
   to identify the genes that matter for local adaptation (Hoffmann \&
   Willi 2008; Stapley 2010). Recent advances in high-throughput molecular
   technologies have facilitated this search, and a variety of approaches
   can be applied, including those grounded in population genetics {[}e.g.
   outlier analysis (Pavlidis 2008)], classical and quantitative genetics
   {[}e.g. quantitative trait locus analysis (MacKay 2009)], and cellular
   and molecular biology {[}e.g. transcriptomics (Larsen 2011)]. However,
   applying these approaches in nonmodel organisms that lack extensive
   genetic and genomic resources has been a formidable challenge. In this
   issue, Papakostas (2012). demonstrate how one such approach
   high-throughput label-free proteomics (reviewed by Gstaiger \& Aebersold
   2009; Domon \& Aebersold 2010) can be applied to detect genes that may
   be involved in local adaptation in a species with limited genomic
   resources. Using this approach, they identified genes that may be
   implicated in local adaptation to salinity in European whitefish
   (Coregonus lavaretus L.) and provide insight into the mechanisms by
   which fish cope with changes in this critically important environmental
   parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic trees and networks are both used in the scientific
   literature to display DNA sequence variation at the intraspecific level.
   Should we rather use trees or networks? I argue that the process of
   inferring the most parsimonious genealogical relationships among a set
   of DNA sequences should be dissociated from the problem of displaying
   this information in a graph. A network graph is probably more
   appropriate than a strict consensus tree if many alternative, equally
   most parsimonious, genealogies are to be included. Within the maximum
   parsimony framework, current phylogenetic inference and network-building
   algorithms are both unable to guarantee the finding of all most
   parsimonious (MP) connections. In fact, each approach can find MP
   connections that the other does not. Although it should be possible to
   improve at least the maximum parsimony approach, current implementations
   of these algorithms are such that it is advisable to use both approaches
   to increase the probability of finding all possible MP connections among
   a set of DNA sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The last glaciation was a dynamic period with strong impact on the
   demography of many species and populations. In recent years,
   mitochondrial DNA sequences retrieved from radiocarbon-dated remains
   have provided novel insights into the history of Late Pleistocene
   populations. However, genotyping of loci from the nuclear genome may
   provide enhanced resolution of population-level changes. Here, we use
   four autosomal microsatellite DNA markers to investigate the demographic
   history of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) in north-eastern
   Siberia from before 60 000 years ago up until the species final
   disappearance c. 4000 years ago. We identified two genetic groups,
   implying a marked temporal genetic differentiation between samples with
   radiocarbon ages older than 12 thousand radiocarbon years before present
   (ka) and those younger than 9 ka. Simulation-based analysis indicates
   that this dramatic change in genetic composition, which included a
   decrease in individual heterozygosity of approximately 30\%, was due to
   a multifold reduction in effective population size. A corresponding
   reduction in genetic variation was also detected in the mitochondrial
   DNA, where about 65\% of the diversity was lost. We observed no further
   loss in genetic variation during the Holocene, which suggests a rapid
   final extinction event.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of population bottlenecks is critical in conservation
   because populations that have experienced significant reductions in
   abundance are subject to a variety of genetic and demographic processes
   that can hasten extinction. Genetic bottleneck tests constitute an
   appealing and popular approach for determining if a population decline
   has occurred because they only require sampling at a single point in
   time, yet reflect demographic history over multiple generations.
   However, a review of the published literature indicates that, as
   typically applied, microsatellite-based bottleneck tests often do not
   detect bottlenecks in vertebrate populations known to have experienced
   declines. This observation was supported by simulations that revealed
   that bottleneck tests can have limited statistical power to detect
   bottlenecks largely as a result of limited sample sizes typically used
   in published studies. Moreover, commonly assumed values for mutation
   model parameters do not appear to encompass variation in microsatellite
   evolution observed in vertebrates and, on average, the proportion of
   multi-step mutations is underestimated by a factor of approximately two.
   As a result, bottleneck tests can have a higher probability of detecting
   bottlenecks in stable populations than expected based on the nominal
   significance level. We provide recommendations that could add rigor to
   inferences drawn from future bottleneck tests and highlight new
   directions for the characterization of demographic history.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing dispersal duration should result in increasing dispersal
   distance, facilitating higher gene flow among populations. As such, it
   has long been predicted that genetic structure (e.g. FST) among
   populations of marine species should be strongly correlated with pelagic
   larval duration (PLD). However, previous studies have repeatedly shown a
   surprisingly poor correspondence. This result has been frequently
   interpreted as evidence for larval behaviours or physical oceanographic
   processes that result in larvae failing to reach their dispersal
   potential, or error inherent in estimating PLD and FST. This study
   employed a computer modelling approach to explore the impacts of various
   uncertainties on the correlation between measures of genetic
   differentiation such as FST and PLD. Results indicate that variation
   resulting from PLD estimation error had minor impacts on the correlation
   between genetic structure and PLD. However, variation in effective
   population size between species, errors in FST estimation and
   non-equilibrium FST values all had major impacts, resulting in
   dramatically weaker correlations between PLD and FST. These results
   suggest that poor correlations between PLD and FST may result from
   variation and uncertainty in the terms associated with the calculation
   of FST values. As such, PLD may be a much stronger determinant of
   realized larval dispersal than suggested by the weak-to-moderate
   correlations between PLD and FST reported in empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Monarch butterflies are best known for their spectacular annual
   migration from eastern North America to Mexico. Monarchs also occur in
   the North American states west of the Rocky Mountains, from where they
   fly shorter distances to the California Coast. Whether eastern and
   western North American monarchs form one genetic population or are
   genetically differentiated remains hotly debated, and resolution of this
   debate is essential to understand monarch migration patterns and to
   protect this iconic insect species. We studied the genetic structure of
   North American migratory monarch populations, as well as nonmigratory
   populations in Hawaii and New Zealand. Our results show that eastern and
   western migratory monarchs form one admixed population and that monarchs
   from Hawaii and New Zealand have genetically diverged from North
   American butterflies. These findings suggest that eastern and western
   monarch butterflies maintain their divergent migrations despite genetic
   mixing. The finding that eastern and western monarchs form one genetic
   population also suggests that the conservation of overwintering sites in
   Mexico is crucial for the protection of monarchs in both eastern and
   western North America.}},

Abstract = {{While motorways are often assumed to influence the movement behaviour of
   large mammals, there are surprisingly few studies that show an influence
   of these linear structures on the genetic make-up of wild ungulate
   populations. Here, we analyse the spatial genetic structure of red deer
   (Cervus elaphus) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) along a stretch of motorway
   in the Walloon part of Belgium. Altogether, 876 red deer were genotyped
   at 13 microsatellite loci, and 325 wild boars at 14 loci. In the case of
   the red deer, different genetic clustering tools identified two genetic
   subpopulations whose borders matched the motorway well. Conversely, no
   genetic structure was identified in the case of the wild boar. Analysis
   of isolation-by-distance patterns of pairs of individuals on the same
   side and on different sides of the motorway also suggested that the road
   was a barrier to red deer, but not to wild boar movement. While
   telemetry studies seem to confirm that red deer are more affected by
   motorways than wild boar, the red deer sample size was also much larger
   than that of the wild boars. We therefore repeated the analysis of
   genetic structure in the red deer with randomly sub-sampled data sets of
   decreasing size. The power to detect the genetic structure using
   clustering methods decreased with decreasing sample size.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the contribution of the various processes that influence
   population genetic structure is important, but difficult. One of the
   reasons is that no single measure appropriately quantifies all aspects
   of genetic structure. An increasing number of studies is analysing
   population structure using the statistic D, which measures genetic
   differentiation, next to GST, which quantifies the standardized variance
   in allele frequencies among populations. Few studies have evaluated
   which statistic is most appropriate in particular situations. In this
   study, we evaluated which index is more suitable in quantifying
   postglacial divergence between three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus) populations from Western Europe. Population structure on this
   short timescale (10 000 generations) is probably shaped by colonization
   history, followed by migration and drift. Using microsatellite markers
   and anticipating that D and GST might have different capacities to
   reveal these processes, we evaluated population structure at two levels:
   (i) between lowland and upland populations, aiming to infer historical
   processes; and (ii) among upland populations, aiming to quantify
   contemporary processes. In the first case, only D revealed clear
   clusters of populations, putatively indicative of population ancestry.
   In the second case, only GST was indicative for the balance between
   migration and drift. Simulations of colonization and subsequent
   divergence in a hierarchical stepping stone model confirmed this
   discrepancy, which becomes particularly strong for markers with moderate
   to high mutation rates. We conclude that on short timescales, and across
   strong clines in population size and connectivity, D is useful to infer
   colonization history, whereas GST is sensitive to more recent
   demographic events.}},

   Genetic analysis of the east-west border population in the Pasvik Valley}},

Abstract = {{Noninvasively collected genetic data can be used to analyse large-scale
   connectivity patterns among populations of large predators without
   disturbing them, which may contribute to unravel the species roles in
   natural ecosystems and their requirements for long-term survival. The
   demographic history of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Northern Europe
   indicates several extinction and recolonization events, but little is
   known about present gene flow between populations of the east and west.
   We used 12 validated microsatellite markers to analyse 1580 hair and
   faecal samples collected during six consecutive years (20052010) in the
   Pasvik Valley at 70 degrees N on the border of Norway, Finland and
   Russia. Our results showed an overall high correlation between the
   annual estimates of population size (Nc), density (D), effective size
   (Ne) and Ne/Nc ratio. Furthermore, we observed a genetic heterogeneity
   of similar to 0.8 and high Ne/Nc ratios of similar to 0.6, which
   suggests gene flow from the east. Thus, we expanded the population
   genetic study to include Karelia (Russia, Finland), Vasterbotten
   (Sweden) and Troms (Norway) (477 individuals in total) and detected four
   distinct genetic clusters with low migration rates among the regions.
   More specifically, we found that differentiation was relatively low from
   the Pasvik Valley towards the south and east, whereas, in contrast,
   moderately high pairwise FST values (0.910.12) were detected between the
   east and the west. Our results indicate ongoing limits to gene flow
   towards the west, and the existence of barriers to migration between
   eastern and western brown bear populations in Northern Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Newly established populations are susceptible to founder events that
   reduce genetic variation. This may be counterbalanced by gene flow after
   populations become established or founders coming from genetically
   different populations. However, initial gains in genetic diversity may
   be short-lived if there is limited mixing between lineages and
   subsequent inbreeding, or if one lineage sweeps to fixation through
   selection or genetic drift. Here, we report on the genetic changes
   taking place within two newly established populations of intertidal
   snail over a 15-year period (similar to 10 generations). Each
   translocation was set up using multiple, genetically distinct source
   populations. Our data show that higher levels of variation in the
   translocated populations compared to the source populations were
   maintained over time for both nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial
   genes. Small changes in allele and haplotype frequencies were observed
   in the source populations and in one of the translocated populations,
   but marked changes were evident in the other, where there was a dramatic
   shift towards the genetic make-up of one of the source populations.
   These genetic changes occurred despite relatively large numbers of
   founders (200374 adults) and no evidence of the population experiencing
   a severe reduction in effective population size. Our study shows that
   the genetic composition of newly established populations can vary
   greatly over time and that genetic outcomes can be highly variable, and
   significantly different from initial expectations, even when they are
   established using high numbers of individuals and involve source
   populations from the same geographic regions.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate understanding of how biological diversity arises, is
   maintained, and lost depends on identifying the genes responsible.
   Although a good deal has been discovered about gene function over the
   past few decades, far less is understood about gene effects, that is,
   how natural variation in a gene contributes to natural variation in
   phenotypes. Trichome density in Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal trait
   for studies of natural molecular and phenotypic variation, as trichome
   initiation is genetically well-characterized and trichome density is
   highly variable in and among natural populations. Here, we show that
   variation at GLABRA1 (GL1), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene, which
   has a role in trichome initiation, has qualitative and likely
   quantitative effects on trichome density in natural accessions of A.
   thaliana. Specifically, we characterize four independent
   loss-of-function alleles for GL1, each of which yields a glabrous
   phenotype. Further, we find that a pattern of common polymorphisms
   confined to the GL1 locus is associated with quantitative variation for
   trichome density. While mutations resulting in a glabrous phenotype are
   primarily coding changes, the pattern resulting in quantitative
   variation spans both coding and regulatory regions. These data show that
   GL1 is an important source of trichome density variation within A.
   thaliana and, along with recent reports, suggest that the TTG1 epidermal
   cell fate pathway generally may be the key molecular genetic source of
   natural trichome density variation and an important model for the study
   of molecular evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Osmoregulation is a vital physiological function for fish, as it helps
   maintain a stable intracellular concentration of ions in environments of
   variable salinities. We focused on a primarily freshwater species, the
   European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), to investigate the molecular
   mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance and examine whether these
   mechanisms differ between genetically similar populations that spawn in
   freshwater vs. brackishwater environments. A common garden experiment
   involving 27 families in two populations and five salinity treatments
   together with a large-scale, high-resolution mass spectrometry
   experiment that quantified 1500 proteins was conducted to assess
   phenotypic and proteomic responses during early development, from
   fertilization until hatching, in the studied populations. The
   populations displayed drastically different phenotypic and proteomic
   responses to salinity. Freshwater-spawning whitefish showed a
   significantly higher mortality rate in higher salinity treatments.
   Calcium, an ion involved in osmotic stress sensing, had a central role
   in the observed proteomic responses. Brackishwater-spawning fish were
   capable of viable osmoregulation, which was modulated by cortisol, an
   important seawater-adaptation hormone in teleost fish. Several proteins
   were identified to play key roles in osmoregulation, most importantly a
   highly conserved cytokine, tumour necrosis factor, whereas calcium
   receptor activities were associated with salinity adaptation. These
   results imply that individuals from these populations are most likely
   adapted to their local environments, even though the baseline level of
   genetic divergence between them is low (FST = 0.049). They also provide
   clues for choosing candidate loci for studying the molecular basis of
   salinity adaptation in other species. Further, our approach provides an
   example of how proteomic methods can be successfully used to obtain
   novel insights into the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation in
   non-model organism.}},

Abstract = {{Genome scan-based tests for selection are directly applicable to natural
   populations to study the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms behind
   phenotypic differentiation. We conducted AFLP genome scans in three
   distinct geographic colour morphs of the cichlid fish Tropheus moorii to
   assess whether the extant, allopatric colour pattern differentiation can
   be explained by drift and to identify markers mapping to genomic regions
   possibly involved in colour patterning. The tested morphs occupy
   adjacent shore sections in southern Lake Tanganyika and are separated
   from each other by major habitat barriers. The genome scans revealed
   significant genetic structure between morphs, but a very low proportion
   of loci fixed for alternative AFLP alleles in different morphs. This
   high level of polymorphism within morphs suggested that colour pattern
   differentiation did not result exclusively from neutral processes.
   Outlier detection methods identified six loci with excess
   differentiation in the comparison between a bluish and a yellow-blotch
   morph and five different outlier loci in comparisons of each of these
   morphs with a red morph. As population expansions and the genetic
   structure of Tropheus make the outlier approach prone to false-positive
   signals of selection, we examined the correlation between outlier locus
   alleles and colour phenotypes in a genetic and phenotypic cline between
   two morphs. Distributions of allele frequencies at one outlier locus
   were indeed consistent with linkage to a colour locus. Despite the
   challenges posed by population structure and demography, our results
   encourage the cautious application of genome scans to studies of
   divergent selection in subdivided and recently expanded populations.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions result in novel species interactions, which can
   have significant evolutionary impacts on both native and invading taxa.
   One evolutionary concern with invasions is hybridization among lineages
   that were previously isolated, but make secondary contact in their
   invaded range(s). Black rats, consisting of several morphologically very
   similar but genetically distinct taxa that collectively have invaded six
   continents, are arguably the most successful mammalian invaders on the
   planet. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, two nuclear gene
   sequences (Atp5a1 and DHFR) and nine microsatellite loci to examine the
   distribution of three invasive black rat lineages (Rattus tanezumi,
   Rattus rattus I and R. rattus IV) in the United States and Asia and to
   determine the extent of hybridization among these taxa. Our analyses
   revealed two mitochondrial lineages that have spread to multiple
   continents, including a previously undiscovered population of R.
   tanezumi in the south-eastern United States, whereas the third lineage
   (R. rattus IV) appears to be confined to Southeast Asia. Analyses of
   nuclear DNA (both sequences and microsatellites) suggested significant
   hybridization is occurring among R. tanezumi and R. rattus I in the
   United States and also suggest hybridization between R. tanezumi and R.
   rattus IV in Asia, although further sampling of the latter species pair
   in Asia is required. Furthermore, microsatellite analyses suggest
   unidirectional introgression from both R. rattus I and R. rattus IV into
   R. tanezumi. Within the United States, introgression appears to be
   occurring to such a pronounced extent that we were unable to detect any
   nuclear genetic signal for R. tanezumi, and a similar pattern was
   detected in Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of waterfowl (Anatidae) have observed the full spectrum
   of mitochondrial (mt) DNA population divergence, from apparent panmixia
   to deep, reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Yet, these studies often
   found weak or no nuclear (nu) DNA structure, which was often attributed
   to male-biased gene flow, a common behaviour within this family. An
   alternative explanation for this conflict is that the smaller effective
   population size and faster sorting rate of mtDNA relative to nuDNA lead
   to different signals of population structure. We tested these
   alternatives by sequencing 12 nuDNA introns for a Holarctic pair of
   waterfowl subspecies, the European goosander (Mergus merganser
   merganser) and the North American common merganser (M. m. americanus),
   which exhibit strong population structure in mtDNA. We inferred
   effective population sizes, gene flow and divergence times from
   published mtDNA sequences and simulated expected differentiation for
   nuDNA based on those histories. Between Europe and North America, nuDNA
   Phi(ST) was 3.4-fold lower than mtDNA Phi(ST), a result consistent with
   differences in sorting rates. However, despite geographically structured
   and monophyletic mtDNA lineages within continents, nuDNA Phi(ST) values
   were generally zero and significantly lower than predicted. This
   between- and within-continent contrast held when comparing mtDNA and
   nuDNA among published studies of ducks. Thus, male-mediated gene flow is
   a better explanation than slower sorting rates for limited nuDNA
   differentiation within continents, which is also supported by
   nonmolecular data. This study illustrates the value of quantitatively
   testing discrepancies between mtDNA and nuDNA to reject the null
   hypothesis that conflict simply reflects different sorting rates.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotropical myrmecophytic tree Cordia alliodora hosts symbiotic
   Azteca ants in most of its widespread range. The taxonomy of the genus
   Azteca is notoriously difficult, which has frequently obscured species
   identity in ecological studies. We used sequence data from one
   mitochondrial and four nuclear loci to infer phylogenetic relationships,
   patterns of geographic distribution, and timing of diversification for
   182 colonies of five C. alliodora-dwelling Azteca species from Mexico to
   Colombia. All morphological species were recovered as monophyletic, but
   we identified at least five distinct genetic lineages within the most
   abundant and specialized species, Azteca pittieri. Mitochondrial and
   nuclear data were concordant at the species level, but not within
   species. Divergence time analyses estimated that C. alliodora-dwelling
   Azteca shared a common ancestor approximately 1022 million years ago,
   prior to the proposed arrival of the host tree in Middle America.
   Diversification in A. pittieri occurred in the Pleistocene and was not
   correlated with geographic distance, which suggests limited historical
   gene flow among geographically restricted populations. This contrasts
   with the previously reported lack of phylogeographic structure at this
   spatial scale in the host tree. Climatic niches, and particularly
   precipitation-related variables, did not overlap between the sites
   occupied by northern and southern lineages of A. pittieri. Together,
   these results suggest that restricted gene flow among ant populations
   may facilitate local adaptation to environmental heterogeneity.
   Differences in population structure between the ants and their host
   trees may profoundly affect the evolutionary dynamics of this widespread
   antplant mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{Recent phylogeographic studies have elucidated the effects of
   Pleistocene glaciations and of Pre-Pleistocene events on populations
   from glacial refuge areas. This study investigates those effects in
   riparian trees (Populus spp.), whose particular features may convey
   enhanced resistance to climate fluctuations. We analysed the
   phylogeographic structure of 44 white (Populus alba), 13 black (Populus
   nigra) and two grey (Populus x canescens) poplar populations in the
   Iberian Peninsula using plastid DNA microsatellites and sequences. We
   also assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure and the extent of
   clonality in four white and one grey poplar populations using nuclear
   microsatellites and we determined quantitative genetic differentiation
   (QST) for growth traits in white poplar. Black poplar displayed higher
   regional diversity and lower differentiation than white poplar,
   reflecting its higher cold-tolerance. The dependence of white poplar on
   phreatic water was evidenced by strong differentiation between the
   Atlantic and Mediterranean drainage basins and among river basins, and
   by weaker isolation by distance within than among river basins. Our
   results suggest confinement to the lower river courses during glacial
   periods and moderate interglacial gene exchange along coastlines. In
   northern Iberian river basins, white poplar had lower diversity, fewer
   private haplotypes and larger clonal assemblies than in southern basins,
   indicating a stronger effect of glaciations in the north. Despite strong
   genetic structure and frequent asexual propagation in white poplar, some
   growth traits displayed adaptive divergence between drainage and river
   basins (QST > FST), highlighting the remarkable capacity of riparian
   tree populations to adapt to regional environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The role of Beringia as a refugium and route for trans-continental
   exchange of fauna during glacial cycles of the past 2 million years are
   well documented; less apparent is its contribution as a significant
   reservoir of genetic diversity. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences and 14
   microsatellite loci, we investigate the phylogeographic history of
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in western North America. Patterns of
   genetic diversity reveal two distinct groups of caribou. Caribou
   classified as a Northern group, of Beringian origin, exhibited greater
   number and variability in mtDNA haplotypes compared to a Southern group
   originating from refugia south of glacial ice. Results indicate that
   subspecies R. t. granti of Alaska and R. t. groenlandicus of northern
   Canada do not constitute distinguishable units at mtDNA or
   microsatellites, belying their current status as separate subspecies.
   Additionally, the Northern Mountain ecotype of woodland caribou
   (presently R. t. caribou) has closer kinship to caribou classified as
   granti or groenlandicus. Comparisons of mtDNA and microsatellite data
   suggest that behavioural and ecological specialization is a more
   recently derived life history characteristic. Notably, microsatellite
   differentiation among Southern herds is significantly greater, most
   likely as a result of human-induced landscape fragmentation and genetic
   drift due to smaller population sizes. These results not only provide
   important insight into the evolutionary history of northern species such
   as caribou, but also are important indicators for managers evaluating
   conservation measures for this threatened species.}},

Abstract = {{For species of conservation concern, knowledge of key life-history and
   demographic components, such as the number and sex ratio of breeding
   adults, is essential for accurate assessments of population viability.
   Species with temperature-dependent sex determination can produce heavily
   biased primary sex ratios, and there is concern that adult sex ratios
   may be similarly skewed or will become so as a result of climate
   warming. Prediction and mitigation of such impacts are difficult when
   life-history information is lacking. In marine turtles, owing to the
   difficultly in observing males at sea, the breeding interval of males is
   unknown. It has been suggested that male breeding periodicity may be
   shorter than that of females, which could help to compensate for
   generally female-biased sex ratios. Here we outline how the use of
   molecular-based paternity analysis has allowed us, for the first time,
   to assess the breeding interval of male marine turtles across multiple
   breeding seasons. In our study rookery of green turtles (Chelonia
   mydas), 97\% of males were assigned offspring in only one breeding
   season within the 3-year study period, strongly suggesting that male
   breeding intervals are frequently longer than 1 year at this site. Our
   results also reveal a sex ratio of breeding adults of at least 1.3 males
   to each female. This study illustrates the utility of molecular-based
   parentage inference using reconstruction of parental genotypes as a
   method for monitoring the number and sex ratio of breeders in species
   where direct observations or capture are difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibian species around the world are currently becoming endangered or
   lost at a rate that outstrips other vertebratesvictims of a combination
   of habitat loss, climate change and susceptibility to emerging
   infectious disease (Stuart 2004). One of the most devastating such
   diseases is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
   (Bd), which infects hundreds of amphibian species on multiple
   continents. While Bd itself has been characterized for some time, we
   still know little about the mechanisms that make it so deadly. In this
   issue of Molecular Ecology, Rosenblum et similar to al. describe a
   genomic approach to this question, reporting the results of a
   genome-wide analysis of the transcriptional response to Bd in the liver,
   skin and spleen of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana mucosa and
   R.similar to sierrae: Fig.similar to 1) (Rosenblum 2012). Their results
   indicate that the skin is not only the first, but likely the most
   important, line of defence in these animals. Strikingly, they describe a
   surprisingly modest immune response to infection in Rana, a result that
   may help explain variable Bd susceptibility across populations and
   species. 1 The frog and the fungus. Left, the mountain yellow-legged

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Lichens are unique among fungal symbioses in that their mycelial
   structures are compact and exposed to the light as thallus structures.
   The myriad intersections of unique fungal species with photosynthetic
   partner organisms (green algae in 90\% of lichens) produce a wide
   variety of diverse shapes and colours of the fully synthesized lichen
   thallus when growing in nature. This characteristic complex morphology
   is, however, not achieved in the fungal axenic state. Even under ideal
   environmental conditions, the lichen life cycle faces considerable odds:
   first, meiotic spores are only produced on well-established thalli and
   often only after achieving considerable age in a stable environment, and
   second, even then in vivo resynthesis requires the presence of
   compatible algal strains where fungal spores germinate. Many lichen
   species have evolved a way around the resynthesis bottleneck by
   producing asexual propagules for joint propagation of symbionts. These
   different dispersal strategies ostensibly shape the population genetic
   structure of lichen symbioses, but the relative contributions of
   vertical (joint) and horizontal (independent) symbiont transmission have
   long eluded lichen evolutionary biologists. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Dal Grande et similar to al. (2012) close in on this question
   with the lung lichen, Lobaria pulmonaria, a flagship species in the
   conservation of old growth forests. By capitalizing on available
   microsatellite markers for both fungal and algal symbionts, they show
   that while vertical transmission is the predominant mode of
   reproduction, horizontal transmission is demonstrable and actively
   shapes population genetic structure. The resulting mixed propagation
   system is a highly successful balance of safe recruitment of symbiotic
   clones and endless possibilities for fungal recombination and symbiont
   shuffling.}},

Abstract = {{The digestive tracts of vertebrates are colonized by complex assemblages
   of micro-organisms, collectively called the gut microbiota. Recent
   studies have revealed important contributions of gut microbiota to
   vertebrate health and disease, stimulating intense interest in
   understanding how gut microbial communities are assembled and how they
   impact host fitness (Sekirov 2010). Although all vertebrates harbour a
   gut microbiota, current information on microbiota composition and
   function has been derived primarily from mammals. Comparisons of
   different mammalian species have revealed intriguing associations
   between gut microbiota composition and host diet, anatomy and phylogeny
   (Ley 2008b). However, mammals constitute <10\% of all vertebrate
   species, and it remains unclear whether similar associations exist in
   more diverse and ancient vertebrate lineages such as fish. In this
   issue, Sullam (2012) make an important contribution toward identifying
   factors determining gut microbiota composition in fishes. The authors
   conducted a detailed meta-analysis of 25 bacterial 16S rRNA gene
   sequence libraries derived from the intestines of different fish
   species. To provide a broader context for their analysis, they compared
   these data sets to a large collection of 16S rRNA gene sequence data
   sets from diverse free-living and host-associated bacterial communities.
   Their results suggest that variation in gut microbiota composition in
   fishes is strongly correlated with species habitat salinity, trophic
   level and possibly taxonomy. Comparison of data sets from fish
   intestines and other environments revealed that fish gut microbiota
   compositions are often similar to those of other animals and contain
   relatively few free-living environmental bacteria. These results suggest
   that the gut microbiota composition of fishes is not a simple reflection
   of the micro-organisms in their local habitat but may result from
   host-specific selective pressures within the gut (Bevins \& Salzman
   2011).}},

Abstract = {{In craniates, opsin-based photopigments expressed in the eye encode
   molecular light sensors that constitute the initial protein in
   photoreception and the activation of the phototransduction cascade.
   Since the cloning and sequencing of the first vertebrate opsin gene
   (bovine rod opsin) nearly 30 years ago (Ovchinnikov Yu 1982, FEBS
   Letters, 148, 179191; Hargrave et similar to al. 1983, Biophysics of
   Structure \& Mechanism, 9, 235244; Nathans \& Hogness 1983, Cell, 34,
   807814), it is now well established that variation in the subtypes and
   spectral properties of the visual pigments that mediate colour and
   dim-light vision is a prevalent mechanism for the molecular adaptation
   to diverse light environments. In this review, we discuss the origins
   and spectral tuning of photopigments that first arose in the agnathans
   to sample light within the ancient aquatic landscape of the Early
   Cambrian, detailing the molecular changes that subsequently occurred in
   each of the opsin classes independently within the main branches of
   extant jawed gnathostomes. Specifically, we discuss the adaptive changes
   that have occurred in the photoreceptors of craniates as they met the
   ecological challenges to survive in quite differing photic niches,
   including brightly lit aquatic surroundings; the deep sea; the

Abstract = {{Lichens are widespread symbioses and play important roles in many
   terrestrial ecosystems. The genetic structure of lichens is the result
   of the association between fungal and algal populations constituting the
   lichen thallus. Using eight fungus- and seven alga-specific highly
   variable microsatellite markers on within-population spatial genetic
   data from 62 replicate populations across Europe, North America, Asia
   and Africa, we investigated the contributions of vertical and horizontal
   transmission of the photobiont to the genetic structure of the epiphytic
   lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. Based on pairwise comparisons of multilocus
   genotypes defined separately for the mycobiont and for the photobiont,
   we inferred the transmission mode of the photobiont and the relative
   contribution of somatic mutation and recombination. After constraining
   the analysis of one symbiont to pairs of individuals with genetically
   identical symbiotic partners, we found that 77\% of fungal and 70\% of
   algal pairs were represented by clones. Thus, the predominant dispersal
   mode was by means of symbiotic vegetative propagules (vertical
   transmission), which dispersed fungal and algal clones co-dependently
   over a short distance, thus shaping the spatial genetic structure up to
   distances of 20 m. Evidence for somatic mutation generating genetic
   diversity was found in both symbionts, accounting for 30\% of pairwise
   comparisons in the alga and 15\% in the fungus. While the alga did not
   show statistically significant evidence of recombination, recombination
   accounted for 7.7\% of fungal pairs with identical algae. This implies
   that, even in a mostly vegetatively reproducing species, horizontal
   transmission plays a role in shaping the symbiotic association, as shown
   in many coral and other symbioses in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Mating systems are thought to be an important determinant of dispersal
   strategies in most animals, including the great apes. As the most basal
   taxon of all great apes, orang-utans can provide information about the
   evolution of mating systems and their consequences for population
   structure in this Family. To assess the sex-specific population
   structure in orang-utans, we used a combination of paternally
   transmitted Y-chromosomal genetic markers and maternally transmitted
   mitochondrial DNA sequences. Markers transmitted through the more
   philopatric sex are expected to show stronger differentiation among
   populations than the ones transmitted through the dispersing sex. We
   studied these patterns using 70 genetic samples from wild orang-utans
   from seven Bornean and two Sumatran populations. We found pronounced
   population structure in haplotype networks of mitochondrial sequence
   data, but much less so for male-specific markers. Similarly,
   mitochondrial genetic differentiation was twice as high among
   populations compared to Y-chromosomal variation. We also found that
   genetic distance increased faster with geographic distance for
   mitochondrial than for Y-linked markers, leading to estimates of male
   dispersal distances that are several-fold higher than those of females.
   These findings provide evidence for strong male-biased dispersal in
   orang-utans. The transition to predominantly female-biased dispersal in
   the great ape lineage appears to be correlated with life in multimale
   groups and may reflect the associated fitness benefits of reliable male
   coalitions with relatives or known partners, a feature that is absent in
   orang-utans.}},

Abstract = {{Acacia saligna is a species complex that has become invasive in a number
   of countries worldwide where it has caused substantial environmental and
   economic impacts. Understanding genetic and other factors contributing
   to its success may allow managers to limit future invasions of closely
   related species. We used three molecular markers to compare the
   introduced range (South Africa) to the native range (Western Australia).
   Nuclear markers showed that invasive populations are divergent from
   native populations and most closely related to a cultivated population
   in Western Australia. We also found incongruence between nuclear and
   chloroplast data that, together with the long history of cultivation of
   the species, suggest that introgressive hybridization (coupled with
   chloroplast capture) may have occurred within A.similar to saligna.
   While we could not definitively prove introgression, the genetic
   distance between cultivated and native A.similar to saligna populations
   was comparable to known interspecific divergences among other Acacia
   species. Therefore, cultivation, multiple large-scale introductions and
   possibly introgressive hybridization have rapidly given rise to the
   divergent genetic entity present in South Africa. This may explain the
   known global variation in invasiveness and inaccuracy of native
   bioclimatic models in predicting potential distributions.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental question in ecology is whether microorganisms follow the
   same patterns as multicellular organisms when it comes to population
   structure and levels of genetic diversity. Enormous population sizes,
   predominately asexual reproduction and presumably high dispersal because
   of small body size could have profound implications on their genetic
   diversity and population structure. Here, we have analysed the
   population genetic structure in a lake-dwelling microbial eukaryote
   (dinoflagellate) and tested the hypothesis that there is population
   genetic differentiation among nearby lake subpopulations. This
   dinoflagellate occurs in the marine-derived saline lakes of the Vestfold
   Hills, Antarctica, which are ice-covered most of the year. Clonal
   strains were isolated from four different lakes and were genotyped using
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Our results show high
   genetic differentiation among lake populations despite their close
   geographic proximity (<9 km). Moreover, genotype diversity was high
   within populations. Gene flow in this system is clearly limited, either
   because of physical or biological barriers. Our results discard the null
   hypothesis that there is free gene flow among protist lake populations.
   Instead, limnetic protist populations may differentiate genetically, and
   lakes act as ecological islands even on the microbial scale.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how specific environmental factors shape gene flow while
   disentangling their importance relative to the effects of geographical
   isolation is a major question in evolutionary biology and a specific
   goal of landscape genetics. Here, we combine information from nuclear
   microsatellite markers and ecological niche modelling to study the
   association between climate and spatial genetic structure and
   variability in Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii), a wind-pollinated
   species with high potential for gene flow. We first test whether genetic
   diversity is associated with climatic niche suitability and stability
   since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Second, we use causal modelling to
   analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM
   niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic
   structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with
   local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher
   immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods
   and/or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic
   structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a
   pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations
   located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After
   controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed
   that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence
   among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche
   suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and/or
   asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall,
   this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape
   patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high
   potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is crucial for gene flow and often determines the long-term
   stability of meta-populations, particularly in rare species with
   specialized life cycles. Such species are often foci of conservation
   efforts because they suffer disproportionally from degradation and
   fragmentation of their habitat. However, detailed knowledge of effective
   gene flow through dispersal is often missing, so that conservation
   strategies have to be based on markrecapture observations that are
   suspected to be poor predictors of long-distance dispersal. These
   constraints have been especially severe in the study of butterfly
   populations, where microsatellite markers have been difficult to
   develop. We used eight microsatellite markers to analyse genetic
   population structure of the Large Blue butterfly Maculinea arion in
   Sweden. During recent decades, this species has become an icon of insect
   conservation after massive decline throughout Europe and extinction in
   Britain followed by reintroduction of a seed population from the Swedish
   island of Oland. We find that populations are highly structured
   genetically, but that gene flow occurs over distances 15 times longer
   than the maximum distance recorded from markrecapture studies, which can
   only be explained by maximum dispersal distances at least twice as large
   as previously accepted. However, we also find evidence that gaps between
   sites with suitable habitat exceeding similar to 20 km induce genetic
   erosion that can be detected from bottleneck analyses. Although further
   work is needed, our results suggest that M. arion can maintain fully
   functional metapopulations when they consist of optimal habitat patches
   that are no further apart than similar to 10 km.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have reported associations between heterozygosity in
   microsatellite markers and fitness-related traits (heterozygosityfitness
   correlations, HFCs). However, it has often been questioned whether HFCs
   reflect general inbreeding depression, because a small panel of
   microsatellite markers does not reflect very well an individuals
   inbreeding coefficient (F) as calculated from a pedigree. Here, we
   challenge this prevailing view. Because of chance events during
   Mendelian segregation, an individuals realized proportion of the genome
   that is identical by descent (IBD) may substantially deviate from the
   pedigree-based expectation (i.e. F). This Mendelian noise may result in
   a weak correlation between F and multi-locus heterozygosity, but this
   does not imply that multi-locus heterozygosity is a bad estimator of
   realized IBD. We examined correlations between 11 fitness-related traits
   measured in up to 1192 captive zebra finches and three measures of
   inbreeding: (i) heterozygosity across 11 microsatellite markers, (ii)
   heterozygosity across 1359 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers
   and (iii) F, based on a 5th-generation pedigree. All 11 phenotypic
   traits showed positive relationships with measures of heterozygosity,
   especially traits that are most closely related to fitness. Remarkably,
   the small panel of microsatellite markers produced equally strong HFCs
   as the large panel of SNP markers. Both marker-based approaches produced
   stronger correlations with phenotypes than the pedigree-based F, and
   this did not seem to result from the shortness of our pedigree. We argue
   that a small panel of microsatellites with high allelic richness may
   better reflect an individuals realized IBD than previously appreciated,
   especially in species like the zebra finch, where much of the genome is
   inherited in large blocks that rarely experience cross-over during
   meiosis.}},

Abstract = {{An extraordinary diversity of epiphytic lichens is found in the boreal
   rainforest of central Norway, the highest-latitude rainforest in the
   world. These rainforest relicts are located in ravine systems, and clear
   cutting has increased the distance between remaining patches. We
   hypothesized that the relatively small lichen populations in the
   remaining forest stands have suffered a depletion of genetic diversity
   through bottlenecks and founder events. To test this hypothesis, we
   assessed genetic diversity and structure in the populations of the
   tripartite lichen Lobaria pulmonaria using eight SSR loci. We sampled
   thalli growing on Picea abies branches and propagules deposited in snow
   at three localities. Contrary to expectations, we found high genetic
   diversity in lichen and snow samples, and high effective sizes of the
   studied populations. Also, limited genetic differentiation between
   populations, high historical migration rates, and a high proportion of
   first generation immigrants were estimated, implying high connectivity
   across distances <30 km. Almost all genetic variation was attributed to
   variation within sites; spatial genetic structures within populations
   were absent or appeared on small scales (510 m). The high genetic
   diversity in the remaining old boreal rainforests shows that even relict
   forest patches might be suitable for conservation of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Delimiting species is very conflicting in the case of very young taxa
   that are in the process of diversification, and even more difficult if
   the species inhabit a heterogeneous environment. In this case, even
   population delimitation is controversial. The South American genus of
   subterranean rodents Ctenomys is highly speciose, with 62 species that
   appeared in the lapse of 3 Myr. Within the genus, the perrensi group,
   formed by three named species and a group of forms of unknown taxonomic
   status, inhabits the Ibera wetland, in northern Argentina. Almost every
   locality shows a particular chromosomal complement. To understand the
   relationships and the evolutionary process among species and
   populations, we examined mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite
   genotypes. We found an isolation-by-distance pattern with evidence of
   cluster-like behaviour of the system. The mitochondrial DNA network
   revealed two different groups, separated by one of the main rivers of
   the region. Clustering methods delimited 12 different populations and
   five metapopulation lineages that seem to be evolving independently. We
   found evidence of ancient migration among localities at the centre of
   the distribution but no signals of current migration among the 12
   delimited clusters. Some of the genetic clusters found included
   localities with different chromosomal numbers, which points to the
   existence of gene flow despite chromosomal variation. The evolutionary
   future of these five lineages is controlled by the dynamics of their
   habitat: if stable, they may become distinct species; otherwise, they
   may collapse into a hybrid swarm, forming a single evolving
   metapopulation.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Tanganyika, Africas oldest lake, harbours an impressive diversity
   of cichlid fishes. Although diversification in its radiating groups is
   thought to have been initially rapid, cichlids from Lake Tanganyika show
   little evidence for ongoing speciation. In contrast, examples of recent
   divergence among sympatric colour morphs are well known in haplochromine
   cichlids from Lakes Malawi and Victoria. Here, we report genetic
   evidence for recent divergence between two sympatric Tanganyikan cichlid
   colour morphs. These Petrochromis morphs share mitochondrial haplotypes,
   yet microsatellite loci reveal that their sympatric populations form
   distinct genetic groups. Nuclear divergence between the two morphs is
   equivalent to that which arises geographically within one of the morphs
   over short distances and is substantially smaller than that among other
   sympatric species in this genus. These patterns suggest that these
   morphs diverged only recently, yet that barriers to gene flow exist
   which prevent extensive admixture despite their sympatric distribution.
   The morphs studied here provide an unusual example of active
   diversification in Lake Tanganyikas generally ancient cichlid fauna and
   enable comparisons of speciation processes between Lake Tanganyika and
   other African lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The cactophilic fly Drosophila mojavensis exhibits considerable
   intraspecific genetic structure across allopatric geographic regions and
   shows associations with different host cactus species across its range.
   The divergence between these populations has been studied for more than
   60 years, yet their exact historical relationships have not been
   resolved. We analysed sequence data from 15 intronic X-linked loci
   across populations from Baja California, mainland Sonora-Arizona and
   Mojave Desert regions under an isolation-with-migration model to assess
   multiple scenarios of divergence. We also compared the results with a
   pre-existing sequence data set of eight autosomal loci. We derived a
   population tree with Baja California placed at its base and link their
   isolation to Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Our estimates suggest
   the Baja California population diverged from an ancestral Mojave
   Desert/mainland Sonora-Arizona group around 230 000270 000 years ago,
   while the split between the Mojave Desert and mainland Sonora-Arizona
   populations occurred one glacial cycle later, 117 000135 000 years ago.
   Although we found these three populations to be effectively allopatric,
   model ranking could not rule out the possibility of a low level of gene
   flow between two of them. Finally, the Mojave Desert population showed a
   small effective population size, consistent with a historical population
   bottleneck. We show that model-based inference from multiple loci can
   provide accurate information on the historical relationships of closely
   related groups allowing us to set into historical context a classic
   system of incipient ecological speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Orogenesis of topographically diverse montane regions often drives
   complex evolutionary histories of species. The extensive biodiversity of
   the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, which gradually decreases
   eastwardly, facilitates a comparison of historical patterns. We use
   coalescence methods to compare species of stream salamanders
   (Batrachuperus) that occur at high and low elevations. Coalescent
   simulations reveal that closely related species are likely to have been
   influenced by different drivers of diversification. Species living in
   the western high-elevation region with its northsouth extending
   mountains appear to have experienced colonization via dispersal followed
   by isolation and divergence. In contrast, species on the eastern
   low-elevation region, which has many discontinuous mountain ranges,
   appear to have experienced fragmentation, sometimes staged, of
   wide-ranging ancestral populations. The two groups of species appear to
   have been affected differently by glaciation. High-elevation species,
   which are more resistant to cooler temperatures, appear to have
   experienced population declines as recently as the last glaciation
   (0.0160.032 Ma). In contrast, salamanders dwelling in the warmer and
   wetter habitats at low-elevation environs appear to have been affected
   less by the relatively recent, milder glaciation, and more so by
   harsher, extensive glaciations (0.50.175 Ma). Thus, elevation,
   topography and cold tolerance appear to drive evolutionary patterns of
   diversification and demography even among closely related taxa. The
   comparison of multiple species in genealogical analyses can lead to an
   understanding of the evolutionary drivers.}},

Abstract = {{Sky islands are ideal systems for determining the effects of climatic
   oscillations on species distributions and genetic structure. Our study
   focused on montane stonefly populations in the Great Basin of western
   North America. We used niche-based distribution modelling,
   phylogeography and traditional species-based biogeography to test
   several hypotheses as follows: (i) genetic differentiation among
   Doroneuria baumanni populations will be independent of hydrologic
   connectivity (headwater model); (ii) Sky islands were colonized when
   habitat was more continuous and populations likely experienced multiple
   expansions and contractions; (iii) Colonization events were coincident
   with the late Pleistocene and Holocene; and (iv) Shared topography and
   climate history will result in concordant patterns of genetic
   differentiation in D.similar to baumanni and occurrences of 32 stonefly
   species across the region. Overall, FSTs and coalescent-based estimates
   of migration were consistent with the headwater model. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian gene trees identified three major nonoverlapping
   east-west clades. Distribution modelling indicated more suitable habitat
   in the Great Basin during the Last Glacial Maximum than at present, but
   none during the last interglacial period. Demographic analyses showed
   evidence of population expansion in one of the three major eastwest
   clades. Intra-clade divergence times (60 000183 000 ybp) were well
   within the late Pleistocene while among-clade divergence times (499
   000719 000 ybp) were deeper. Genetic differentiation in D.similar to
   baumanni and distributions of stonefly species were significantly
   concordant. These results imply that climatic oscillations have played
   major roles in shaping the genetic structure and distributions of Great
   Basin stoneflies, but that divergence among clades occurred much earlier
   than our late Pleistocence/early Holocene predictions.}},

   discrimination or by-product of partner choice and demography?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Intra-group relatedness does not necessarily imply kin selection, a
   leading explanation for social evolution. An overlooked mechanism for
   generating population genetic structure is variation in longevity and
   fecundity, referred to as individual quality, affecting kin structure
   and the potential for cooperation. Individual quality also affects
   choosiness in partner choice, a key process explaining cooperation
   through direct fitness benefits. Reproductive skew theory predicts that
   relatedness decreases with increasing group size, but this relationship
   could also arise because of quality-dependent demography and partner
   choice, without active kin association. We addressed whether
   brood-rearing eider (Somateria mollissima) females preferentially
   associated with kin using a 6-year data set with individuals genotyped
   at 19 microsatellite loci and tested whether relatedness decreased with
   increasing female group size. We also determined the relationship
   between local relatedness and indices of female age and body condition.
   We further examined whether the level of female intracoalition
   relatedness differed from background relatedness in any year. As
   predicted, median female intra-group relatedness decreased with
   increasing female group size. However, the proportion of related
   individuals increased with advancing female age, and older females
   prefer smaller brood-rearing coalitions, potentially producing a
   negative relationship between group size and relatedness. There were
   considerable annual fluctuations in the level of relatedness between
   coalition-forming females, and in 1 year this level exceeded that
   expected by random association. Thus, both passive and active mechanisms
   govern kin associations in brood-rearing eiders. Eiders apparently can
   discriminate between kin, but the benefits of doing so may vary over
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Philopatry and sex-biased dispersal have a strong influence on
   population genetic structure, so the study of species dispersal patterns
   and evolutionary mechanisms shaping them are of great interest.
   Particularly nongregarious mammalian species present an underexplored
   field of study: despite their lower levels of sociality compared to
   group-living species, interactions among individuals do occur, providing
   opportunities for cryptic kin selection. Among the least gregarious
   primates are orang-utans (genus: Pongo), in which preferential
   associations among females have nevertheless been observed, but for
   which the presence of kin structures was so far unresolved because of
   the equivocal results of previous genetic studies. To clarify
   relatedness and dispersal patterns in orang-utans, we examined the
   largest longitudinal set of individuals with combined genetic, spatial
   and behavioural data. We found that males had significantly higher
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and more unique haplotypes, thus
   underscoring their different maternal ancestries compared to females.
   Moreover, pedigree reconstruction based on 24 highly polymorphic
   microsatellite markers and mtDNA haplotypes demonstrated the presence of
   three matrilineal clusters of generally highly related females with
   substantially overlapping ranges. In orang-utans and possibly other
   nongregarious species, comparing average biparental relatedness (r) of
   males and females to infer sex-biased dispersal is extremely
   problematic. This is because the opportunistic sampling regime
   frequently employed in nongregarious species, combined with overlapping
   space use of distinct matrilineal clusters, leads to a strong downward
   bias when mtDNA lineage membership is ignored. Thus, in nongregarious
   species, correct inferences of dispersal can only be achieved by
   combining several genetic approaches with detailed spatial information.}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic bacteria often help their hosts acquire nutrients from their
   diet, showing trends of co-evolution and independent acquisition by
   hosts from the same trophic levels. While these trends hint at important
   roles for biotic factors, the effects of the abiotic environment on
   symbiotic community composition remain comparably understudied. In this
   investigation, we examined the influence of abiotic and biotic factors
   on the gut bacterial communities of fish from different taxa, trophic
   levels and habitats. Phylogenetic and statistical analyses of 25 16S
   rRNA libraries revealed that salinity, trophic level and possibly host
   phylogeny shape the composition of fish gut bacteria. When analysed
   alongside bacterial communities from other environments, fish gut
   communities typically clustered with gut communities from mammals and
   insects. Similar consideration of individual phylotypes (vs.
   communities) revealed evolutionary ties between fish gut microbes and
   symbionts of animals, as many of the bacteria from the guts of
   herbivorous fish were closely related to those from mammals. Our results
   indicate that fish harbour more specialized gut communities than
   previously recognized. They also highlight a trend of convergent
   acquisition of similar bacterial communities by fish and mammals,
   raising the possibility that fish were the first to evolve symbioses
   resembling those found among extant gut fermenting mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic differentiation during adaptive divergence and speciation is
   heterogeneous among genomic regions. Some regions can be highly
   differentiated between populations, for example, because they harbour
   genes under divergent selection or those causing reproductive isolation
   and thus are resistant to gene flow. Other regions might be homogenized
   by gene flow and thus weakly differentiated. Debates persist about the
   number of differentiated regions expected under divergence with gene
   flow, and their causes, size, and genomic distribution. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, a study of freshwater stickleback used
   next-generation sequencing to shed novel insight into these issues
   (Roesti et similar to al. 2012). Many genomic regions distributed across
   the genome were strongly differentiated, indicating divergence with gene
   flow can involve a greater number of loci than often thought.
   Nonetheless, differentiation of some regions, such as those near the
   centre of chromosomes where recombination is reduced, was strongly
   accentuated over others. Thus, divergence was widespread yet highly
   heterogeneous across the genome. Moreover, different population pairs
   varied in patterns of differentiation, illustrating how genomic
   divergence builds up across stages of the speciation process. The study
   demonstrates how variation in different evolutionary processes, such as
   selection and recombination rate, can combine to result in similar
   genomic patterns. Future work could focus on teasing apart the
   contributions of different processes for causing differentiation, a task
   facilitated by experimental manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental goal for evolutionary biologists is to connect the
   processes of natural selection and genetic drift with the maintenance of
   genetic variation in the wild. There are now scores of examples in which
   mapping phenotypes to genotypes has identified the molecular basis of
   traits in natural populations, but documenting the fitness consequences
   of these genes has proven more elusive. A long-term study of several
   thousand unmanaged sheep on the remote Scottish island of Hirta in the
   St. Kilda archipelago provides a unique opportunity to make these
   connections between genotype, phenotype and fitness. Since 1985, there
   has been a steady decline in the frequency of sheep with a rare uniform
   (self-) pigmentation pattern as opposed to the more common wild-type
   pattern of dark upper body and pale belly. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Gratten et similar to al. (2012) link variation at the agouti
   signalling protein (ASIP) gene with 25 years of pedigree information and
   individual fitness data to investigate the contributions of natural
   selection and genetic drift to this decline. Consistent with the
   decrease in frequency of self-type sheep, Gratten et similar to al.
   demonstrate that recessive genetic variants at ASIP are associated with
   reduced lifetime fitness. But surprisingly, these variants show the
   opposite trend to the self-type phenotype by increasing throughout the
   study period. This paradoxical result occurs because heterozygotes that
   harbour the majority of self-type alleles have increased in frequency.
   This pattern would not have been detectable if only phenotype had been
   monitored because the pigmentation pattern of heterozygotes is
   indistinguishable from that of wild-type homozygotes. The study provides
   an excellent example of the importance of measuring selection at both
   the phenotypic and genetic level, and demonstrates how long-term
   pedigrees can be used to link alleles to phenotypes and ultimately to
   fitness.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the
   spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a
   landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The
   tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped
   onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The
   characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which
   is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and
   thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e.
   metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its
   distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective
   pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus
   be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant
   populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of
   attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative
   genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species.
   What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the
   first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us
   closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive
   phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
   Dougl. ex Loud.).}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2839-2846}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The genetic population structure of many species is characterised by a
   pattern of isolation by distance (IBD): due to limited dispersal,
   individuals that are geographically close tend to be genetically more
   similar than individuals that are far apart. Despite the ubiquity of IBD
   in nature, many commonly used statistical tests are based on a null
   model that is completely non-spatial, the Island model. Here, I argue
   that patterns of spatial autocorrelation deriving from IBD present a
   problem for such tests as it can severely bias their outcome. I use
   simulated data to illustrate this problem for two widely used types of
   tests: tests of hierarchical population structure and the detection of
   loci under selection. My results show that for both types of tests the
   presence of IBD can indeed lead to a large number of false positives. I
   therefore argue that all analyses in a study should take the spatial
   dependence in the data into account, unless it can be shown that there
   is no spatial autocorrelation in the allele frequency distribution that
   is under investigation. Thus, it is urgent to develop additional
   statistical approaches that are based on a spatially explicit null model
   instead of the non-spatial Island model.}},

Abstract = {{Predicted parallel impacts of habitat fragmentation on genes and species
   lie at the core of conservation biology, yet tests of this rule are

   many populations through extrapolation from very small sample sizes.
   Using the data of this recent work, we show that results estimated from
   the smallest sample sizes drive the speciesgenetic diversity correlation
   (SGDC), owing to a false-positive association between habitat
   fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity. Small sample sizes are a
   persistent problem in habitat fragmentation studies, the results of
   which often do not fit simple theoretical models. It is essential,

Abstract = {{Nazareno \& Jump (2012) highlight potential issues with using small

   been driven by three sites with the lowest number of individuals

   literature, Nazareno \& Jumps (2012) comment serves as a useful reminder
   to us all. Nevertheless, we disagree that our findings were
   significantly biased by sampling limitations. Here, we demonstrate by
   jackknifing that, contrary to the claims of Nazareno \& Jump (2012), our
   correlations of allelic richness and fragment area are not driven solely
   by sites with low sample sizes. We maintain that small sample sizes can

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2852-2862}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary diversification is often initiated by adaptive divergence
   between populations occupying ecologically distinct environments while
   still exchanging genes. The genetic foundations of this divergence
   process are largely unknown and are here explored through genome scans
   in multiple independent lakestream population pairs of threespine
   stickleback. We find that across the pairs, overall genomic divergence
   is associated with the magnitude of divergence in phenotypes known to be
   under divergent selection. Along this same axis of increasing
   diversification, genomic divergence becomes increasingly biased towards
   the centre of chromosomes as opposed to the peripheries. We explain this
   pattern by within-chromosome variation in the physical extent of
   hitchhiking, as recombination is greatly reduced in chromosome centres.
   Correcting for this effect suggests that a great number of genes
   distributed widely across the genome are involved in the divergence into
   lake vs. stream habitats. Analyzing additional allopatric population
   pairs, however, reveals that strong divergence in some genomic regions
   has been driven by selection unrelated to lakestream ecology. Our study
   highlights a major contribution of large-scale variation in
   recombination rate to generating heterogeneous genomic divergence and
   indicates that elucidating the genetic basis of adaptive divergence
   might be more challenging than currently recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic local population decline brought about by anthropogenic-driven
   change is an increasingly common threat to biodiversity. Seabird life
   history traits make them particularly vulnerable to such change;
   therefore, understanding population connectivity and dispersal dynamics
   is vital for successful management. Our study used a 357-base pair
   mitochondrial control region locus sequenced for 103 individuals and 18
   nuclear microsatellite loci genotyped for 245 individuals to investigate
   population structure in the Atlantic and Pacific populations of the
   pelagic seabird, Leachs storm-petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa leucorhoa.
   This species is under intense predation pressure at one regionally
   important colony on St Kilda, Scotland, where a disparity between
   population decline and predation rates hints at immigration from other
   large colonies. amova, FST,FST and Bayesian cluster analyses revealed no
   genetic structure among Atlantic colonies (Global FST = -0.02 P > 0.05,
   Global FST = 0.003, P > 0.05, structureK = 1), consistent with either
   contemporary gene flow or strong historical association within the ocean
   basin. The Pacific and Atlantic populations are genetically distinct
   (Global FST = 0.32 P < 0.0001, Global FST = 0.04, P < 0.0001, structureK
   = 2), but evidence for interocean exchange was found with individual
   exclusion/assignment and population coalescent analyses. These findings
   highlight the importance of conserving multiple colonies at a number of
   different sites and suggest that management of this seabird may be best
   viewed at an oceanic scale. Moreover, our study provides an illustration
   of how long-distance movement may ameliorate the potentially deleterious
   impacts of localized environmental change, although direct measures of
   dispersal are still required to better understand this process.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonid fishes rank among species being most severely affected by
   introgressive hybridization as a result of a long tradition of stocking
   with hatchery-reared conspecifics. The objectives of this study were (i)
   to evaluate the genetic consequences of stocking and resulting
   introgression rates on the genetic integrity of natural populations of
   brook charr, (ii) to identify genomic regions potentially associated
   with adaptation to natural and artificial rearing environments, and
   (iii) to test the null hypothesis that introgression from domesticated
   brook charr into wild populations is homogeneous among loci. A total of
   336 individuals were sampled from nine lakes, which were stocked at
   different intensities with domestic fish. Individuals were genotyped at
   280 SNPs located in transcribed regions and developed by means of
   next-generation sequencing. As previously reported with microsatellites,
   we observed a positive relationship between stocking intensity and
   genetic diversity among stocking groups, and a decrease in population
   differentiation. Individual admixture proportions also increased with
   stocking intensity. Moreover, genomic cline analysis revealed 27 SNPs,
   seven of which were also identified as outliers in a genome scan, which
   showed an introgression rate either more restricted or enhanced relative
   to neutral expectations. This indicated that selection, mainly for
   growth-related biological processes, has favored or hampered the
   introgression of genomic blocks into the introgressed wild populations.
   Overall, this study highlights the usefulness of investigating the
   impact of stocking on the dynamics of introgression of potentially
   adaptive genetic variation to better understand the consequences of such
   practice on the genomic integrity of wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonid populations of many rivers are rapidly declining. One possible
   explanation is that habitat fragmentation increases genetic drift and
   reduces the populations potential to adapt to changing environmental
   conditions. We measured the genetic and eco-morphological diversity of
   brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a Swiss stream system, using multivariate
   statistics and Bayesian clustering. We found large genetic and
   phenotypic variation within only 40 km of stream length. Eighty-eight
   percent of all pairwise FST comparisons and 50\% of the population
   comparisons in body shape were significant. High success rates of
   population assignment tests confirmed the distinctiveness of populations
   in both genotype and phenotype. Spatial analysis revealed that
   divergence increased with waterway distance, the number of weirs, and
   stretches of poor habitat between sampling locations, but effects of
   isolation-by-distance and habitat fragmentation could not be fully
   disentangled. Stocking intensity varied between streams but did not
   appear to erode genetic diversity within populations. A lack of
   association between phenotypic and genetic divergence points to a role
   of local adaptation or phenotypically plastic responses to habitat
   heterogeneity. Indeed, body shape could be largely explained by
   topographic stream slope, and variation in overall phenotype matched the
   flow regimes of the respective habitats.}},

Title = {{Neither philopatric nor panmictic: microsatellite and mtDNA evidence
   suggests lack of natal homing but limits to dispersal in Pacific lamprey}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most species with lengthy migrations display some degree of natal
   homing; some (e.g. migratory birds and anadromous salmonids) show
   spectacular feats of homing. However, studies of the sea lamprey
   (Petromyzon marinus) indicate that this anadromous species locates
   spawning habitat based on pheromonal cues from larvae rather than
   through philopatry. Previous genetic studies in the anadromous Pacific
   lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) have both supported and rejected the
   hypothesis of natal homing. To resolve this, we used nine microsatellite
   loci to examine the population structure in 965 Pacific lamprey from 20
   locations from central British Columbia to southern California and
   supplemented this analysis with mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis on a subset of 530 lamprey. Microsatellite
   analysis revealed (i) relatively low but often statistically significant
   genetic differentiation among locations (97\% pairwise FST values were
   <0.04 but 73.7\% were significant); and (ii) weak but significant
   isolation by distance (r2 = 0.0565, P = 0.0450) but no geographic
   clustering of samples. The few moderate FST values involved comparisons
   with sites that were geographically distant or far upstream. The mtDNA
   analysisalthough providing less resolution among sites (only 4.7\%FST
   values were significant)was broadly consistent with the microsatellite
   results: (i) the southernmost site and some sites tributary to the
   Salish Sea were genetically distinct; and (ii) southern sites showed
   higher haplotype and private haplotype richness. These results are
   inconsistent with philopatry, suggesting that anadromous lampreys are
   unusual among species with long migrations, but suggest that limited
   dispersal at sea precludes panmixia in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental change has a wide range of ecological consequences,
   including species extinction and range expansion. Many studies have
   shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain
   pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to
   unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range
   expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to
   determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population
   from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred.
   Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in
   western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found
   significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i)
   Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and
   diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the
   northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have
   arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent
   climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the
   hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to
   the need for population specific information to improve our
   understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion
   across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack
   pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British
   Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these
   populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine
   beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events. This study
   illustrates a rapid range-wide response to the removal of climatic
   constraints, and the potential for range expansion of a regional
   population.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Translocation has been widely studied as a tool for conservation
   management to restore or enhance degraded populations. On the contrary,
   few studies have been conducted on translocation for commercial
   purposes. In this study, we evaluate the genetic consequences of
   translocation of wild individuals of Pinctada margaritifera on farmed
   and adjacent wild populations. We tested the hypotheses that
   translocations would induce high genetic heterogeneity in farmed
   populations and this heterogeneity would then leak into the adjacent
   wild populations. In fact, farmed samples exhibit high levels of
   heterogeneity and low pairwise relatedness compared to wild populations,
   highlighting the pooling of genetically divergent populations into
   farms. We also demonstrate that this heterogeneity is transmitted to
   adjacent wild populations as a result of interbreeding. Adjacent wild
   populations tend to have higher genetic diversity values and greater
   pairwise relatedness coefficient with farmed populations than wild
   populations. Overall, pearl culture in French Polynesia promotes the
   mixing of unrelated individuals in farmed locations and reduces genetic
   divergence among geographically distant populations as well as among
   farmed and wild populations of a same lagoon. We also studied for the
   first time a farmed population originating from spat collected in a
   lagoon where release of hatchery-produced larvae occurred 10 years ago
   and we were able to identify four distinct genetic groups. These groups
   contribute highly to reproduction and caused considerable genetic drift
   in the lagoon, suggesting that hatchery-produced larvae are neither
   sustainable method for pearl culture nor for conserving the diversity of
   P. margaritifera in French Polynesia.}},

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence that organisms adapt to their native environment
   when gene flow is restricted. However, evolution of plastic responses
   across discrete environments is less well examined. We studied
   divergence in means and plasticity across wild and hatchery populations
   of sea-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a common garden experiment with
   two rearing environments (hatchery and a nearly natural experimental
   stream). Since natural and hatchery environments differ, this
   arrangement provides an experiment in contemporary adaptation across the
   two environments. A QST - FST approach was used to investigate local
   adaptation in survival and growth over the first summer. We found
   evidence for divergent selection in survival in 1 year and in body
   length in both years and rearing environments. In general, the hatchery
   populations had higher survival and larger body size in both
   environments. QST in body size did not differ between the rearing
   environments, and constitutive divergence in the means was in all cases
   stronger than divergence in the plastic responses. These results suggest
   that in this system, constitutive changes in mean trait values are more
   important for local adaptation than increased plasticity. In addition,
   ex situ rearing conditions induce changes in trait means that are
   adaptive in the hatchery, but potentially harmful in the wild,
   suggesting that hatchery rearing is likely to be a suboptimal management
   strategy for trout populations facing selection in the stream
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in natural
   populations is a core aim of evolutionary genetics. Insight can be
   gained by quantifying selection at the level of the genotype, as opposed
   to the phenotype. Here, we show that in a natural population of Soay
   sheep which is polymorphic for coat pattern, recessive genetic variants
   at the causal gene, agouti signalling protein (ASIP) are associated with
   reduced lifetime fitness. This was due primarily to a reduction in
   juvenile survival of uniformly coloured (self-type) sheep, which are
   homozygous recessive, and occurs despite significantly higher
   reproductive success in surviving self-type adults. Consistent with
   their relatively low fitness, we show that the frequency of self-type
   individuals has declined from 1985 to 2008. Remarkably though, the
   frequency of the underlying self-allele has increased, because the
   frequency of heterozygous individuals (who harbour the majority of all
   self-alleles) has increased. Indeed, the ratio of observed/expected
   heterozygous individuals has increased during the study, such that there
   is now a significant excess of heterozygotyes. By employing
   gene-dropping simulations, we show that microevolutionary trends in the
   frequency and excess of ASIP heterozygotes are too pronounced to be
   caused by genetic drift. Studying this polymorphism at the level of
   phenotype rather than underlying genotype would have failed to detect
   cryptic fitness differences. We would also have been unable to rule out
   genetic drift as an evolutionary force driving genetic change. This
   highlights the importance of resolving the underlying genetic basis of
   phenotypic variation in explaining evolutionary dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Pine cones that remain closed and retain seeds until fire causes the
   cones to open (cone serotiny) represent a key adaptive trait in a
   variety of pine species. In lodgepole pine, there is substantial
   geographical variation in serotiny across the Rocky Mountain region.
   This variation in serotiny has evolved as a result of geographically
   divergent selection, with consequences that extend to forest communities
   and ecosystems. An understanding of the genetic architecture of this
   trait is of interest owing to the wide-reaching ecological consequences
   of serotiny and also because of the repeated evolution of the trait
   across the genus. Here, we present and utilize an inexpensive and
   time-effective method for generating population genomic data. The method
   uses restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to generate a library of
   fragments that can be sequenced with a high level of multiplexing. We
   obtained data for more than 95 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms
   across 98 serotinous and nonserotinous lodgepole pines from three
   populations. We used a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) to test
   for an association between genotypic variation at these loci and
   serotiny. The probability of serotiny varied by genotype at 11 loci, and
   the association between genotype and serotiny at these loci was
   consistent in each of the three populations of pines. Genetic variation
   across these 11 loci explained 50\% of the phenotypic variation in
   serotiny. Our results provide a first genome-wide association map of
   serotiny in pines and demonstrate an inexpensive and efficient method
   for generating population genomic data.}},

Abstract = {{Taxanes are defensive metabolites produced by Taxus species (yews) and
   used in anticancer therapies. Despite their medical interest, patterns
   of natural diversity in taxane-related genes are unknown. We examined
   variation at five main genes of Taxus baccata in the Iberian Peninsula,
   a region where unique yew genetic resources are endangered. We looked at
   several gene features and applied complementary neutrality tests,
   including diversity/divergence tests, tests solely based on site
   frequency spectrum (SFS) and Zengs compound tests. To account for
   specific demography, microsatellite data were used to infer historical
   changes in population size based on an Approximate Bayesian Computation
   (ABC) approach. Polymorphism-divergence tests pointed to positive
   selection for genes TBT and TAT and balancing selection for DBAT. In
   addition, neutrality tests based on SFS found that while a recent
   reduction in population size may explain most statistics values,
   selection may still be in action in genes TBT and DBAT, at least in some
   populations. Molecular signatures on taxol genes suggest the action of
   frequent selective waves with different direction or intensity, possibly
   related to varying adaptive pressures produced by the hostenemy
   co-evolution on defence-related genes. Such natural selection processes
   may have produced taxane variants still undiscovered.}},

Abstract = {{Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Hypocreales, Ascomycetes) is an
   entomopathogenic fungus specific to formicine ants (Formicinae,
   Hymenoptera). Previous works have shown that the carpenter ant
   Camponotus leonardi acts as the principal host with occasional
   infections of ants from the genus Polyrhachis (sister genus of
   Camponotus). Observations were made on the permanent plots of Mo Singto,
   Khao Yai National Park of Thailand according to which O.unilateralis was
   found to occur predominantly on three host species: C.leonardi,
   C.saundersi and P.furcata. Molecular phylogenies of the elongation
   factor 1-a and beta-Tubulin genes indicate a separation of
   O.unilateralis samples into three clades, reflecting specificity to each
   of the three different ant species. Samples collected from P.furcata and
   from C.leonardi were found to form sister groups with samples from
   C.saundersi forming an outgroup to the latter. Additional samples
   collected from unidentified ant species of Camponotus and Polyrhachis
   were positioned as outgroups to those samples on identified species.
   These results demonstrate that O. unilateralis is clearly not a single
   phylogenetic species and comprises at least three species that are
   specific to different host ant species. These cryptic species may arise
   through recent events of speciation driven by their specificity to host
   ant species.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of a hybrid zone between two house mouse subspecies (Mus
   musculus musculus and M.similar to m.similar to domesticus) along with
   studies using laboratory crosses reveal a large role for the X
   chromosome and multiple autosomal regions in reproductive isolation as a
   consequence of disrupted epistasis in hybrids. One limitation of
   previous work has been that most of the identified genomic regions have
   been large. The goal here is to detect and characterize precise genomic
   regions underlying reproductive isolation. We surveyed 1401 markers
   evenly spaced across the genome in 679 mice collected from two different
   transects. Comparisons between transects provide a means for identifying
   common patterns that likely reflect intrinsic incompatibilities. We used
   a genomic cline approach to identify patterns that correspond to
   epistasis. From both transects, we identified contiguous regions on the
   X chromosome in which markers were inferred to be involved in epistatic
   interactions. We then searched for autosomal regions showing the same
   patterns and found they constitute about 5\% of autosomal markers. We
   discovered substantial overlap between these candidate regions
   underlying reproductive isolation and QTL for hybrid sterility
   identified in laboratory crosses. Analysis of gene content in these
   regions suggests a key role for several mechanisms, including the
   regulation of transcription, sexual conflict and sexual selection
   operating at both the postmating prezygotic and postzygotic stages of
   reproductive isolation. Taken together, these results indicate that
   speciation in two recently diverged (c. 0.5 Ma) house mouse subspecies
   is complex, involving many genes dispersed throughout the genome and
   associated with distinct functions.}},

Abstract = {{The role of natural selection in speciation has received increasing
   attention and support in recent years. Different types of approaches
   have been developed that can detect genomic regions influenced by
   selection. Here, we address the question whether two highly different
   methodsFST outlier analysis and admixture analysisdetect largely the
   same set of non-neutral genomic elements or, instead, complementary
   sets. We study genetic architecture in a natural secondary contact zone
   where extensive admixture occurs. The marine bivalves Macoma balthica
   rubra and M. b. balthica descend from two independent trans-Arctic
   invasions of the north Atlantic and hybridize extensively where they
   meet, for example in the KattegatDanish StraitsBaltic Sea region. The
   KattegatDanish Straits region forms a steep salinity cline and is the
   only entrance to the recently (ca. 8000 years ago) established brackish
   water basin the Baltic Sea. Salinity along the contact zone drops from
   30 parts per thousand (Skagerrak, M.b.rubra) to 3 parts per
   thousand(Baltic, M.b.balthica). Both outlier analysis and genomic clines
   analysis suggest that large parts of the genome are influenced by
   non-neutral effects. Contrasting samples from well outside the hybrid
   zone, outlier analysis detects 16 of 84 amplified fragment length
   polymorphism markers as significant FST outliers. Genomic clines
   analysis detects 31 of 84 markers as non-neutral inside the hybrid zone.
   Remarkably, only three markers are detected by both methods. We conclude
   that the two methods together identify a suite of markers that are under
   the influence of non-neutral effects.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how pathogens invade and become established in novel host
   populations is central to the ecology and evolution of infectious
   disease. Influenza viruses provide unique opportunities to study these
   processes in nature because of their rapid evolution, extensive
   surveillance, large data sets and propensity to jump species boundaries.
   H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is a major animal
   pathogen and public health threat. The virus is of particular importance
   in Indonesia, causing severe outbreaks among poultry and sporadic human
   infections since 2003. However, little is known about how H5N1 HPAIV
   emerged and established in Indonesia. To address these questions, we
   analysed Indonesian H5N1 HPAIV gene sequences isolated during 20032007.
   We find that the virus originated from a single introduction into East
   Java between November 2002 and October 2003. This invasion was
   characterized by an initially rapid burst of viral genetic diversity
   followed by a steady rate of lineage replacement and the maintenance of
   genetic diversity. Several antigenic sites in the haemagglutinin gene
   were subject to positive selection during the early phase, suggesting
   that host-immune-driven selection played a role in host adaptation and
   expansion. Phylogeographic analyses show that after the initial invasion
   of H5N1, genetic variants moved both eastwards and westwards across
   Java, possibly involving long-distance transportation by humans. The
   phylodynamics we uncover share similarities with other recently studied
   viral invasions, thereby shedding light on the ecological and
   evolutionary processes that determine disease emergence in a new
   geographical region.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for widespread, mobile species to exhibit genetic
   structure without clear geographic barriers is a topic of growing
   interest. Yet the patterns and mechanisms of structureparticularly over
   broad spatial scalesremain largely unexplored for these species. Bobcats
   occur across North America and possess many characteristics expected to
   promote gene flow. To test whether historical, topographic or ecological
   factors have influenced genetic differentiation in this species, we
   analysed 1 kb mtDNA sequence and 15 microsatellite loci from over 1700
   samples collected across its range. The primary signature in both marker
   types involved a longitudinal cline with a sharp transition, or suture
   zone, occurring along the Great Plains. Thus, the data distinguished
   bobcats in the eastern USA from those in the western half, with no
   obvious physical barrier to gene flow. Demographic analyses supported a
   scenario of expansion from separate Pleistocene refugia, with the Great
   Plains representing a zone of secondary contact. Substructure within the
   two main lineages likely reflected founder effects, ecological factors,
   anthropogenic/topographic effects or a combination of these forces. Two
   prominent topographic features, the Mississippi River and Rocky
   Mountains, were not supported as significant genetic barriers.
   Ecological regions and environmental correlates explained a small but
   significant proportion of genetic variation. Overall, results implicate
   historical processes as the primary cause of broad-scale genetic
   differentiation, but contemporary forces seem to also play a role in
   promoting and maintaining structure. Despite the bobcats mobility and
   broad niche, large-scale landscape changes have contributed to
   significant and complex patterns of genetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Three mantras often guide species and ecosystem management: (i) for
   preventing invasions by harmful species, early detection and rapid
   response; (ii) for conserving imperilled native species, protection of
   biodiversity hotspots; and (iii) for assessing biosecurity risk, an
   ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure. However, these and other
   management goals are elusive when traditional sampling tools (e.g.
   netting, traps, electrofishing, visual surveys) have poor detection
   limits, are too slow or are not feasible. One visionary solution is to
   use an organisms DNA in the environment (eDNA), rather than the organism
   itself, as the target of detection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   Thomsen et al. (2012) provide new evidence demonstrating the feasibility
   of this approach, showing that eDNA is an accurate indicator of the
   presence of an impressively diverse set of six aquatic or amphibious
   taxa including invertebrates, amphibians, a fish and a mammal in a wide
   range of freshwater habitats. They are also the first to demonstrate
   that the abundance of eDNA, as measured by qPCR, correlates positively
   with population abundance estimated with traditional tools. Finally,
   Thomsen et al. (2012) demonstrate that next-generation sequencing of
   eDNA can quantify species richness. Overall, Thomsen et al. (2012)
   provide a revolutionary roadmap for using eDNA for detection of species,
   estimates of relative abundance and quantification of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Niche theory is one of the central organizing concepts in ecology.
   Generally, this theory defines a given species niche as all of the
   factors that effect the persistence of the species as well as the impact
   of the species in a given location (Hutchinson 1957; Chase 2011). Many
   studies have argued that phenotypic plasticity enhances niche width
   because plastic responses allow organisms to express advantageous
   phenotypes in a broader range of environments (Bradshaw 1965; Van Valen
   1965; Sultan 2001). Further, species that exploit habitats with
   fine-grained variation, or that form metapopulations, are expected to
   develop broad niche widths through phenotypic plasticity (Sultan \&
   Spencer 2002; Baythavong 2011). Although a long history of laboratory,
   greenhouse and reciprocal transplant experiments have provided insight
   into how plasticity contributes to niche width (Pigliucci 2001), recent
   advances in molecular approaches allow for a mechanistic understanding
   of plasticity at the molecular level (Nicotra 2010). In particular,
   variation in epigenetic effects is a potential source of the
   within-genotype variation that underlies the phenotypic plasticity
   associated with broad niche widths. Epigenetic mechanisms can alter gene
   expression and function without altering DNA sequence (Richards 2006)
   and may be stably transmitted across generations (Jablonka \& Raz 2009;
   Verhoeven 2010). Also, epigenetic mechanisms may be an important
   component of an individuals response to the environment (Verhoeven
   2010). While these ideas are intriguing, few studies have made a clear
   connection between genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and phenotypic
   plasticity (e.g. Bossdorf 2010). In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   Herrera (2012) present a study that demonstrates epigenetic changes in
   genome-wide DNA methylation are causally active in a species ability to
   exploit resources from a broad range of environments and are
   particularly important in harsh environments.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal endophytes in the genera Epichloe and Neotyphodium, collectively
   termed the epichloae, have fascinated biologists for decades. These
   intriguing fungi, also referred to as class 1 or clavicipitaceous
   endophytes, spend the large majority, or even their entire life cycle,
   within the tissues of their cool-season grass hosts without eliciting
   any symptoms of infection. While all epichloae reside within the
   intercellular spaces of aboveground vegetative grass tissues, the
   species at the symbiotic extreme are known as Neotyphodium, and the
   intimacy of their interaction extends to the reproductive (flowering)
   stage. At this point, fungal filaments (hyphae) nondestructively invade
   the developing ovaries of their host and are incorporated into perfectly
   viable, healthy seeds. Thus, these endophytes live solely within the
   tissues of their host plants and are transmitted maternally from
   generation to generation. A second life history characteristic of
   interest is that while all Epichloe and some Neotyphodium species are
   haploid, a great many of the strictly seed-transmitted Neotyphodium spp.
   are interspecific hybrids. This phenomenon may be critical for the
   success of these symbioses over longer spans of evolutionary time and
   will be discussed in greater detail below. A third characteristic, and
   one of the primary reasons these grass endophytes have received so much
   attention over the last three decades, is the strong mutualistic nature
   these relationships often exhibit. In exchange for photosynthetically
   derived carbon, the endophytes protect their cool-season grass hosts
   from grazing herbivores and a variety of abiotic stresses. It has been
   hypothesized that these three biological phenomena are related (Schardl
   \& Craven 2003), perhaps with the former two driving the third, and it
   is here that the recent article in Molecular Ecology entitled Genetic
   diversity in epichloid endophytes of Hordelymus europaeus suggests
   repeated host jumps and interspecific hybridizations, by Oberhofer \&
   Leuchtmann (2012), provides critical clues to linking these traits
   together. While the large majority of studies have focused on
   documenting the ever-increasing list of mutualistic qualities attributed
   to these fungi, very few have taken an exhaustive population-level
   approach to document plant and endophyte genotypes within a naturally
   occurring system (Faeth 2010; Jani 2010; Tintjer \& Rudgers 2006). Such
   information is crucial to more fully elucidate the factors shaping
   grass-endophyte symbioses and those often driving these relationships to
   mutualistic extremes.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystems are among the most endangered habitats on Earth,
   with thousands of animal species known to be threatened or already
   extinct. Reliable monitoring of threatened organisms is crucial for
   data-driven conservation actions but remains a challenge owing to
   nonstandardized methods that depend on practical and taxonomic
   expertise, which is rapidly declining. Here, we show that a diversity of
   rare and threatened freshwater animalsrepresenting amphibians, fish,
   mammals, insects and crustaceanscan be detected and quantified based on
   DNA obtained directly from small water samples of lakes, ponds and
   streams. We successfully validate our findings in a controlled mesocosm
   experiment and show that DNA becomes undetectable within 2 weeks after
   removal of animals, indicating that DNA traces are near contemporary
   with presence of the species. We further demonstrate that entire faunas
   of amphibians and fish can be detected by high-throughput sequencing of
   DNA extracted from pond water. Our findings underpin the ubiquitous
   nature of DNA traces in the environment and establish environmental DNA
   as a tool for monitoring rare and threatened species across a wide range
   of taxonomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{Escaped domesticated individuals can introduce disadvantageous traits
   into wild populations due to both adaptive differences between
   population ancestors and human-induced changes during domestication. In
   contrast to their domesticated counterparts, some endangered wild
   Atlantic salmon populations encounter during their marine stage large
   amounts of suspended sediments, which may act as a selective agent. We
   used microarrays to elucidate quantitative transcriptional differences
   between a domesticated salmon strain, a wild population and their
   first-generation hybrids during their marine life stage, to describe
   transcriptional responses to natural suspended sediments, and to test
   for adaptive genetic variation in plasticity relating to a history of
   natural exposure or nonexposure to suspended sediments. We identified 67
   genes differing in transcription level among salmon groups. Among these
   genes, processes related to energy metabolism and ion homoeostasis were
   over-represented, while genes contributing to immunity and
   actin-/myosin-related processes were also involved in strain
   differentiation. Domesticwild hybrids exhibited intermediate
   transcription patterns relative to their parents for two-thirds of all
   genes that differed between their parents; however, genes deviating from
   additivity tended to have similar levels to those expressed by the wild
   parent. Sediments induced increases in transcription levels of eight
   genes, some of which are known to contribute to external or
   intracellular damage mitigation. Although genetic variation in
   plasticity did not differ significantly between groups after correcting
   for multiple comparisons, two genes (metallothionein and glutathione
   reductase) tended to be more plastic in response to suspended sediments
   in wild and hybrid salmon, and merit further examination as candidate
   genes under natural selection.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Identifying conservation units below the species level is becoming
   increasingly important, particularly when limited resources necessitate
   prioritization for conservation among such units. This problem is
   exemplified with caribou, a mammal with a circum-Arctic distribution
   that is exposed to a broad spectrum of ecological conditions, but is
   also declining in many parts of its range. We used microsatellite
   markers to evaluate the suitability of existing intra-specific taxonomic
   designations to act as population units for conservation and contrasted
   this with landscape features that were independent of taxonomy. We also
   quantified the relationship between genetic differentiation and
   subpopulation size, a factor that has been under-represented in
   landscape genetic research. Our data set included three subspecies and
   three ecotypes of caribou that varied in population size by five orders
   of magnitude. Our results indicated that genetic structure did not
   correspond to existing taxonomic designation, particularly at the level
   of ecotype. Instead, we found that major valleys and population size
   were the strongest factors associated with substructure. There was a
   negative exponential relationship between population size and FST
   between pairs of adjacent subpopulations, suggesting that genetic drift
   was the mechanism causing the structure among the smallest
   subpopulations. A genetic assignment test revealed that movement among
   subpopulations was a fraction of the level needed to stabilize smaller
   subpopulations, indicating little chance for demographic rescue. Such
   results may be broadly applicable to landscape genetic studies, because
   population size and corresponding rates of drift have the potential to
   confound interpretations of landscape effects on population structure.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{In addition to genetic differences between individuals as a result of
   nucleotide sequence variation, epigenetic changes that occur as a result
   of DNA methylation may also contribute to population niche width by
   enhancing phenotypic plasticity, although this intriguing possibility
   remains essentially untested. Using the nectar-living yeast
   Metschnikowia reukaufii as study subject, we examine the hypothesis that
   changes in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns underlie the ability of
   this fugitive species to exploit a broad resource range in its
   heterogeneous and patchy environment. Data on floral nectar
   characteristics and their use by M. reukaufii in the wild were combined
   with laboratory experiments and methylation-sensitive amplified
   polymorphism (MSAP) analyses designed to detect epigenetic responses of
   single genotypes to variations in sugar environment that mimicked those
   occurring naturally in nectar. M. reukaufii exploited a broad range of
   resources, occurring in nectar of 48\% of species and 52\% of families
   surveyed, and its host plants exhibited broad intra- and interspecific
   variation in sugar-related nectar features. Under experimental
   conditions, sugar composition, sugar concentration and their interaction
   significantly influenced the mean probability of MSAP markers
   experiencing a transition from unmethylated to methylated state.
   Alterations in methylation status were not random but predictably
   associated with certain markers. The methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine
   (5-AzaC) had strong inhibitory effects on M. reukaufii proliferation in
   sugar-containing media, and a direct relationship existed across sugar X
   concentration experimental levels linking inhibitory effect of 5-AzaC
   and mean per-marker probability of genome-wide methylation.
   Environmentally induced DNA methylation polymorphisms allowed genotypes
   to grow successfully in extreme sugar environments, and the broad
   population niche width of M. reukaufii was largely made possible by
   epigenetic changes enabling genotype plasticity in resource use.}},

Abstract = {{Metagenomic methods provide an experimental approach to inform the
   relationships between hosts and their microbial inhabitants. Previous
   studies have provided the conceptual realization that microbiomes are
   dynamic among hosts and the intimacy of relation between micro- and
   macroorganisms. Here, we present an intestinal microflora community
   analysis for members of the order Chiroptera and investigate the
   relative influence of variables in shaping observed microbiome
   relationships. The variables ranged from those considered to have
   ancient and long-term influences (host phylogeny and life history) to
   the relatively transient variable of host reproductive condition. In
   addition, collection locality data, representing the geographic
   variable, were included in analyses. Results indicate a complex
   influence of variables in shaping sample relationships in which signal
   for host phylogeny is recovered at broad taxonomic levels (family),
   whereas intrafamilial analyses disclosed various degrees of resolution
   for the remaining variables. Although cumulative probabilities of
   assignment indicated both reproductive condition and geography
   influenced relationships, comparison of ecological measures among groups
   revealed statistical differences between most variable classifications.
   For example, ranked ecological diversity was associated with host
   phylogeny (deeper coalescences among families were associated with more
   microfloral diversity), dietary strategy (herbivory generally retained
   higher diversity than carnivory) and reproductive condition
   (reproductively active females displayed more diverse microflora than
   nonreproductive conditions). Overall, the results of this study describe
   a complex process shaping microflora communities of wildlife species as
   well as provide avenues for future research that will further inform the
   nature of symbiosis between microflora communities and hosts.}},

   (Mycoplasma gallisepticumMG). Three days following experimental
   infection with MG, we observed differences in the splenic
   transcriptional responses between house finches from eastern U.S.
   populations, with a 12-year history of MG exposure, versus western U.S.
   populations, with no history of exposure to MG. In particular, western
   birds down-regulated gene expression, while eastern finches showed no
   expression change relative to controls. Studies involving poultry have
   shown that MG can manipulate host immunity, and our observations suggest
   that pathogen manipulation occurred only in finches from the western
   populations, outside the range of MG. Fourteen days after infection,
   eastern finches, but not western finches, up-regulated genes associated
   with acquired immunity (cell-mediated immunity) relative to controls.
   These observations suggest population differences in the temporal course
   of the response to infection with MG and imply that innate immune
   processes were targets of selection in response to MG in the eastern
   U.S. population.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific gene flow can lead to the formation of hybrid populations
   that have a competitive advantage over the parental populations, even
   for hybrids from a cross between crops and wild relatives. Wild prickly
   lettuce (Lactuca serriola) has recently expanded in Europe and
   hybridization with the related crop species (cultivated lettuce, L.
   sativa) has been hypothesized as one of the mechanisms behind this
   expansion. In a basically selfing species, such as lettuce, assessing
   hybridization in natural populations may not be straightforward.
   Therefore, we analysed a uniquely large data set of plants genotyped
   with SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers with two programs for Bayesian
   population genetic analysis, STRUCTURE and NewHybrids. The data set
   comprised 7738 plants, including a complete genebank collection, which
   provided a wide coverage of cultivated germplasm and a fair coverage of
   wild accessions, and a set of wild populations recently sampled across
   Europe. STRUCTURE analysis inferred the occurrence of hybrids at a level
   of 7\% across Europe. NewHybrids indicated these hybrids to be advanced
   selfed generations of a hybridization event or of one backcross after
   such an event, which is according to expectations for a basically
   selfing species. These advanced selfed generations could not be detected
   effectively with crop-specific alleles. In the northern part of Europe,
   where the expansion of L. serriola took place, the fewest putative
   hybrids were found. Therefore, we conclude that other mechanisms than
   crop/wild gene flow, such as an increase in disturbed habitats and/or
   climate warming, are more likely explanations for this expansion.}},

Title = {{Host-jump drives rapid and recent ecological speciation of the emergent

Abstract = {{Ecological speciation through host-shift has been proposed as a major
   route for the appearance of novel fungal pathogens. The growing
   awareness of their negative impact on global economies and public health
   created an enormous interest in identifying the factors that are most
   likely to promote their emergence in nature. In this work, a combination
   of pathological, molecular and geographical data was used to investigate
   the recent emergence of the fungus Colletotrichum kahawae. C. kahawae
   emerged as a specialist pathogen causing coffee berry disease in Coffea
   arabica, owing to its unparalleled adaptation of infecting green coffee
   berries. Contrary to current hypotheses, our results suggest that a
   recent host-jump underlay the speciation of C. kahawae from a generalist
   group of fungi seemingly harmless to coffee berries. We posit that
   immigrant inviability and a predominantly asexual behaviour could have
   been instrumental in driving speciation by creating pleiotropic
   interactions between local adaptation and reproductive patterns.
   Moreover, we estimate that C. kahawae began its diversification at <2200
   bp leaving a very short time frame since the divergence from its sibling
   lineage (c. 5600 bp), during which a severe drop in C. kahawaes
   effective population size occurred. This further supports a scenario of
   recent introduction and subsequent adaptation to C. arabica.
   Phylogeographical data revealed low levels of genetic polymorphism but
   provided the first geographically consistent population structure of C.
   kahawae, inferring the Angolan population as the most ancestral and the
   East African populations as the most recently derived. Altogether, these
   results highlight the significant role of host specialization and
   asexuality in the emergence of fungal pathogens through ecological
   speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerating the description of biodiversity is a major challenge as
   extinction rates increase. Integrative taxonomy combining molecular,
   morphological, ecological and geographical data is seen as the best
   route to reliably identify species. Classic molluscan taxonomic
   methodology proposes primary species hypotheses (PSHs) based on shell
   morphology. However, in hyperdiverse groups, such as the molluscan
   family Turridae, where most of the species remain unknown and for which
   homoplasy and plasticity of morphological characters is common,
   shell-based PSHs can be arduous. A four-pronged approach was employed to
   generate robust species hypotheses of a 1000 specimen South-West Pacific
   Turridae data set in which: (i) analysis of COI DNA Barcode gene is
   coupled with (ii) species delimitation tools GMYC (General Mixed Yule
   Coalescence Method) and ABGD (Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery) to
   propose PSHs that are then (iii) visualized using Klee diagrams and (iv)
   evaluated with additional evidence, such as nuclear gene rRNA 28S,
   morphological characters, geographical and bathymetrical distribution to
   determine conclusive secondary species hypotheses (SSHs). The
   integrative taxonomy approach applied identified 87 Turridae species,
   more than doubling the amount previously known in the Gemmula genus. In
   contrast to a predominantly shell-based morphological approach, which
   over the last 30 years proposed only 13 new species names for the
   Turridae genus Gemmula, the integrative approach described here
   identified 27 novel species hypotheses not linked to available species
   names in the literature. The formalized strategy applied here outlines
   an effective and reproducible protocol for large-scale species
   delimitation of hyperdiverse groups.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid speciation may contribute significantly to generating
   biodiversity, but only a few well-documented examples for it exist so
   far that do not involve polyploidization as a mechanism. The swordtail
   fish, Xiphophorus clemenciae, shows common hallmarks of a hybrid origin
   and still overlaps in its current geographic distribution with its
   putative ancestral species (Xiphophorus hellerii and Xiphophorus
   maculatus). Xiphophorus clemenciae provides an ideal system for
   investigating the possible continued genetic interactions between a
   hybrid and its parental species. Here, we use microsatellite and
   mitochondrial markers to investigate the population structure of these
   species of swordtails and search for signs of recent hybridization.
   Individuals were sampled from 21 localities across the known range of X.
   clemenciae the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT) Mexico, and several
   environmental parameters that might represent barriers to dispersal were
   recorded. The hybridization event that gave rise to X. clemenciae
   appears to be rather ancient, and a single origin is likely. We find
   negligible evidence for ongoing hybridization and introgression between
   the putative ancestral species, because they now occupy distinct
   ecological niches, and a common haplotype is shared by most populations
   of X. clemenciae. The population structure within these species shows an
   isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern and genetic differentiation between
   most populations is significant and high. We infer that tectonic
   evolution in the Isthmus has greatly restricted gene flow between the
   southern and central IT populations of X. clemenciae and X. helleriii
   and provide preliminary information to aid in conservation management of
   this geographically restricted hybrid species, X. clemenciae.}},

Abstract = {{Epichloid fungal endophytes (Epichloe and Neotyphodium spp.) are
   excellent model systems for studying speciation processes because of
   their variable life history traits that are linked to host grass
   fitness. Presumed jumps to new hosts and subsequent somatic
   hybridizations appear to be common among epichloid endophytes resulting
   in increased genetic variation upon which selection can act and
   speciation be initiated. In this study, we explored the endophyte
   diversity of a rare European native woodland grass species, Hordelymus
   europaeus, along a latitudinal transect covering the entire distribution
   range of H. europaeus. From 28 populations in six countries, isolates
   were sampled and molecularly characterized. Based on the sequences of
   tubB and tefA, six distinct epichloid taxa (interspecific hybrid or
   cryptic haploid species) were found, of which four were novel and two
   have been previously reported from this host. Of the novel endophytes,
   two were presumed to be interspecific hybrids and two of nonhybrid
   origin. While previously known endophytes of H. europaeus are seed-born
   and strictly asexual, one of the novel nonhybrid endophytes found in the
   glacial refugium of the Apennine peninsula reproduced sexually in
   cultured plants. This is the first case of a seed-borne, but sexually
   reproducing endophyte of this host. We discuss the origin, and possible
   ancestral species, of the six epichloid taxa using phylogenetic
   analyses. Repeated host jumps and somatic hybridizations characterize
   the diversity of the endophytes. To date, no other grass species is
   known to host a larger diversity of endophytes than H. europaeus.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of second-generation sequencing has made it possible to
   quickly and economically generate whole mitochondrial genome
   (mitogenome) sequences. To date, mitogenome studies of nonmodel
   organisms have demonstrated increased power for resolving interspecies
   relationships. We explored an alternate use of such data to recover
   relationships and population history of closely related lineages with a
   shallow evolutionary history. Using a GS-FLX platform, we sequenced 106
   mitogenomes from the Coregonus lavaretus (Europe) and Coregonus
   clupeaformis (North America) species complexes to investigate the
   evolutionary history of the endangered Danish North Sea houting (NSH)
   and other closely related Danish and Baltic European lake whitefish
   (ELW). Two well-supported clades were found within both ELW and NSH,
   probably reflecting historical introgression via Baltic migrants.
   Although ELW and NSH are not reciprocally monophyletic, they share no
   haplotypes, suggesting recent, but strong, reproductive isolation. The
   divergence time between NSH and the geographically closest ELW
   population was estimated using IMa, assuming isolation with migration
   and a new mutation rate estimate chosen to avoid time-dependency
   effects. The estimate of c. 2700 bp was remarkably similar to results
   obtained using microsatellite markers. Within North American C.
   clupeaformis, the divergence time between the two lineages (Atlantic and
   Acadian) was estimated as between 20 000 and 60 000 bp. Under the
   assumption that NSH and ELW colonized Denmark following the last glacial
   maximum, Bayesian Serial SimCoal analysis showed consistency with a
   scenario of long-term stability, resulting from a rapid initial sixfold
   population expansion. The findings illustrate the utility of mitogenome
   data for resolving recent intraspecific divergence events and provide
   evidence for recent reproductive isolation of the phenotypically
   divergent NSH.}},

Abstract = {{This study puts together genetic data and an approximate bayesian
   computation (ABC) approach to infer the time at which the tree Geoffroea
   spinosa colonized the Galapagos Islands. The genetic diversity and
   differentiation between Peru and Galapagos population samples, estimated
   using three chloroplast spacers and six microsatellite loci, reveal
   significant differences between two mainland regions separated by the
   Andes mountains (Inter Andean vs. Pacific Coast) as well as a
   significant genetic differentiation of island populations.
   Microsatellites identify two distinct geographical clusters, the
   Galapagos and the mainland, and chloroplast markers show a private
   haplotype in the Galapagos. The nuclear distinctiveness of the Inter
   Andean populations suggests current restricted pollen flow, but
   chloroplast points to cross-Andean dispersals via seeds, indicating that
   the Andes might not be an effective biogeographical barrier. The ABC
   analyses clearly point to the colonization of the Galapagos within the
   last 160 000 years and possibly as recently as 4750 years ago (475
   generations). Founder events associated with colonization of the two
   islands where the species occurs are detected, with Espanola having been
   colonized after Floreana. We discuss two nonmutually exclusive
   possibilities for the colonization of the Galapagos, recent natural
   dispersal vs. human introduction.}},

Abstract = {{The barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus) is a rare forest bat with a
   wide distribution in Europe. Here, we combine results from the analysis
   of two mtDNA fragments with species distribution modelling to determine
   glacial refugia and postglacial colonization routes. We also
   investigated whether niche conservatism occurs in this species. Glacial
   refugia were identified in the three southern European peninsulas:
   Iberia, Italy and the Balkans. These latter two refugia played a major
   role in the postglacial colonization process, with their populations
   expanding to England and central Europe, respectively.
   Palaeo-distribution models predicted that suitable climatic conditions
   existed in the inferred refugia during the last glacial maximum (LGM).
   Nevertheless, the overlap between the current and the LGM distributions
   was almost inexistent in Italy and in the Balkans, meaning that B.
   barbastellus populations were forced to shift range between glacial and
   interglacial periods, a process that probably caused some local
   extinctions. In contrast, Iberian populations showed a refugia within
   refugium pattern, with two unconnected areas containing stable
   populations (populations that subsisted during both glacial and
   interglacial phases). Moreover, the match between LGM models and the
   refugial areas determined by molecular analysis supported the hypothesis
   of niche conservatism in B. barbastellus. We argue that geographic
   patterns of genetic structuring, altogether with the modelling results,
   indicate the existence of four management units for conservation:
   Morocco, Iberia, Italy and UK, and Balkans and central Europe. In
   addition, all countries sampled possessed unique gene pools, thus
   stressing the need for the conservation of local populations.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated cycles of glaciation have had major impacts on the distribution
   of genetic diversity of the Antarctic marine fauna. During glacial
   periods, ice cover limited the amount of benthic habitat on the
   continental shelf. Conversely, more habitat and possibly altered seaways
   were available during interglacials when the ice receded and the sea
   level was higher. We used microsatellites and partial sequences of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene to examine genetic structure in
   the direct-developing, endemic Southern Ocean octopod Pareledone
   turqueti sampled from a broad range of areas that circumvent Antarctica.
   We find that, unusually for a species with poor dispersal potential, P.
   turqueti has a circumpolar distribution and is also found off the
   islands of South Georgia and Shag Rocks. The overriding pattern of
   spatial genetic structure can be explained by hydrographic (with ocean
   currents both facilitating and hindering gene flow) and bathymetric
   features. The Antarctic Peninsula region displays a complex population
   structure, consistent with its varied topographic and oceanographic
   influences. Genetic similarities between the Ross and Weddell Seas,
   however, are interpreted as a persistent historic genetic signature of
   connectivity during the hypothesized Pleistocene West Antarctic Ice
   Sheet collapses. A calibrated molecular clock indicates two major
   lineages within P. turqueti, a continental lineage and a sub-Antarctic
   lineage, that diverged in the mid-Pliocene with no subsequent gene flow.
   Both lineages survived subsequent major glacial cycles. Our data are
   indicative of potential refugia at Shag Rocks and South Georgia and also
   around the Antarctic continent within the Ross Sea, Weddell Sea and off
   Adelie Land. The mean age of mtDNA diversity within these main
   continental lineages coincides with Pleistocene glacial cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Mating between relatives often results in negative fitness consequences
   or inbreeding depression. However, the expression of inbreeding in
   populations of wild cooperative mammals and the effects of
   environmental, maternal and social factors on inbreeding depression in
   these systems are currently not well understood. This study uses
   pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients from a long-term study of
   meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in South Africa to reveal that 44\% of the
   population have detectably non-zero (F > 0) inbreeding coefficients.
   15\% of these inbred individuals were the result of moderate inbreeding
   (F = 0.125), although such inbreeding events almost solely occurred when
   mating individuals had no prior experience of each other. Inbreeding
   depression was evident for a range of traits: pup mass at emergence from
   the natal burrow, hind-foot length, growth until independence and
   juvenile survival. However, we found no evidence of significant
   inbreeding depression for skull and forearm length or for pup survival.
   This research provides a rare investigation into inbreeding in a
   cooperative mammal, revealing high levels of inbreeding, considerable
   negative consequences and complex interactions with the social
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Uniparental maternal brood care often coincides with multiple paternity
   and single maternity of broods, possibly reflecting benefits of
   polyandry and costs of uniparental care. Genetic data from the
   maternally mouthbrooding cichlid fish Simochromis pleurospilus revealed
   the opposite pattern low polyandry and allomaternal care. More than 70\%
   of the investigated females had mated with a single male, and 14\% of
   the females had unrelated fry in their broods. Broods with foreign fry
   were in the late stage of brood care, in which females guard
   free-swimming fry and recall the broods into their mouths for
   protection. With one exception, fostering females were related to their
   adopted fry at the level of first cousins (RQG > 0.12), but relatedness
   between fosters and adopted fry was not significantly higher than
   between fosters and fry tended by other females. Relatedness among
   breeders extended to the level of first-order relatives. Mean
   relatedness among contemporaneously breeding dams (RQG = 0.08) was
   significantly higher than among dams breeding in different seasons (RQG
   = -0.04), which suggests a temporal or spatial concentration of
   mouthbrooding relatives. Indeed, females sometimes brood in small
   groups. This behaviour may reduce brood predation but will increase the
   risk of brood mixing, which is possibly mitigated by low costs of brood
   care and indirect benefits accrued by relatedness among the breeders in
   the group. Remarkably, the apparent inbreeding potential did not give
   rise to bet-hedging polyandry or active avoidance of relatives, as half
   of the mated individuals were related at RQG > 0.13 and polyandry did
   not coincide with high within-pair relatedness.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary theory predicts that senescencea decline in reproduction
   and survival with increasing agecan evolve as a trade-off between
   investment in reproduction on one side and in somatic maintenance and
   repair on the other. The ecology of a species is crucial because it
   provides the external causes of death that determine the statistical
   limit to a species lifespan. Filamentous fungi are generally believed to
   be nonsenescent, and there are indeed spectacular examples of very old
   fungal individuals in nature. However, some fungi utilize ephemeral
   resources, and therefore, senescence is expected to have evolved, like
   in the coprophilic Podospora anserina, the only well-studied filamentous
   fungus with intrinsic senescence. Here, we hypothesize that rapid
   senescence is more common in fungi than generally believed and that the
   phylogenetic distribution of senescence correlates with ecology. We
   collected lifespan data for a set of Sordariomycetes and constructed
   phylogenies based on several nuclear sequences. Several of the strains
   were from the CBS culture collection, originally isolated from various
   substrates, some of which ephemeral. In addition, we isolated new
   strains from short-lived substrates. Senescence was observed throughout
   the phylogeny. Correlation tests support the hypothesis that in the
   Sordariomycetes, senescence is a trait that has arisen in response to
   ephemeral substrates, and that it has evolved repeatedly and
   independently along the phylogeny.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy for species to survive climate change will be to change
   adaptively their way of life. Understanding rapid adaptation to climate
   change is therefore a priority for current research. In this issue,
   Turrero (2012) use an original approach to unravel life history trait
   responses to climate change in two fish species (Salmo trutta and S.
   salar). Going against the flow, the authors adopt the strategy of going
   back to the future by investigating the responses of fish to the warming
   periods that followed the Last Glacial Period (approximately 3020 000
   years BP). To do this, they analysed Salmo vertebrae from well-dated
   archaeological sites in northern Spain in order to uncover key life
   history traits, which they then compared to those of contemporary
   specimens. They found that, as the climate got warmer, Salmo species
   tended to reduce the time spent in growing areas and reached spawning
   areas at a younger age; this tendency began approximately 15 000 years
   BP and accelerated in contemporary periods. The implication is a lower
   age at maturity and a lower reproductive success, which they tentatively
   related to recent declines in population growth rate. This innovative
   study demonstrates how changes in life history traits are linked both to
   the population growth rate and to the evolutionary rate under climatic
   constraints, which may serve as a basis for future conservation
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive clines are striking examples of natural selection in action,
   yet few have been studied in depth. In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   Kooyers \& Olsen (2012) introduce modern analyses and thinking towards
   studies of a classical example of the rapid and repeated evolution of
   latitudinal and altitudinal clines in cyanogenesis in white clover,
   Trifolium repens L. Recognizing that adaptive clines represent
   trade-offs in the selective benefits of traits at different ends of a
   geographical transect, these researchers focus on whether evidence for
   selection can be found at regional (coarse) and local (fine) scales.
   After adjusting for population genetic patterns generated by demographic
   processes, Kooyers and Olsen provide evidence that the cyanogenesis
   cline is adaptive across a transect from Louisiana to Wisconsin, USA.
   Within local populations, divergent selection on coupling dominant and
   recessive alleles that underlie cyanogenesis is predicted to drive
   populations to gametic phase disequilibrium (LD), a pattern that has
   been found in several other studies reviewed by Kooyers and Olsen. The
   absence of LD within any sampled populations in this study leads the
   authors to suggest that selective patterns within these clines may be
   more complex than previously proposed, perhaps even following
   theoretical predictions of a geographic mosaic.}},

Abstract = {{Life history traits determine fitness and hence the ability of
   populations and species to survive through adverse conditions.
   Therefore, identifying temporal changes in life history traits over
   large timescales is necessary to understand and predict the effect of
   current global change on wild populations. In this study, we compare
   life history traits between Palaeolithic and present-day vertebrates,
   analysing the number of winters spent in the river and at sea by North
   Iberian salmonids (Salmo salar and Salmo trutta) from two separate time
   frames: the Upper Palaeolithic, based on archaeological remains, and the
   present day, based on sport catches. The river stage did not change
   significantly, but the marine period has been shortened in modern
   anadromous specimens, accordingly shortening mean generation time.
   Population growth rates have been estimated through Bayesian analyses of
   the mitochondrial DNA control region of modern specimens for the two
   Salmo species using two different mutation rates (1\% and 3.6\%).
   Coincidence of coalescent Ne estimates with independent Ne calculated
   from catches suggests that the 3.6\% mutation rate fits better the
   evolution of the studied populations. Population growth rate declines
   would have occurred in the last millennium and could be explained by a
   combination of climatic events and anthropogenic activities.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of mitochondrial control region polymorphisms have supported
   the presence of several demographically independent green turtle
   (Chelonia mydas) rookeries in the Greater Caribbean region. However,
   extensive sharing of common haplotypes based on 490-bp control region
   sequences confounds assessment of the scale of natal homing and
   population structure among regional rookeries. We screened the majority
   of the mitochondrial genomes of 20 green turtles carrying the common
   haplotype CM-A5 and representing the rookeries of Buck Island, St.
   Croix, United States Virgin Islands (USVI); Aves Island, Venezuela;
   Galibi, Suriname; and Tortuguero, Costa Rica. Five single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified that subdivided CM-A5 among
   regions. Mitogenomic pairwise fST values of eastern Caribbean rookery
   comparisons were markedly lower than the respective pairwise FST values.
   This discrepancy results from the presence of haplotypes representing
   two divergent lineages in each rookery, highlighting the importance of
   choosing the appropriate test statistic for addressing the study
   question. Haplotype frequency differentiation supports demographic
   independence of Aves Island and Suriname, emphasizing the need to
   recognize the smaller Aves rookery as a distinct management unit. Aves
   Island and Buck Island rookeries shared mitogenomic haplotypes; however,
   frequency divergence suggests that the Buck Island rookery is
   sufficiently demographically isolated to warrant management unit status
   for the USVI rookeries. Given that haplotype sharing among rookeries is
   common in marine turtles with cosmopolitan distributions, mitogenomic
   sequencing may enhance inferences of population structure and
   phylogeography, as well as improve the resolution of mixed stock
   analyses aimed at estimating natal origins of foraging turtles.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how communities assemble is a central goal of ecology.
   This is particularly relevant for communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF), because the community composition of these beneficial plant
   symbionts influences important ecosystem processes. Moreover, AMF may be
   used as sensitive indicators of ecological soil quality if they respond
   to environmental variation in a predictable way. Here, we use a
   molecular profiling technique (T-RFLP of 25S rRNA gene fragments) to
   test which factors determine AM fungal community composition in 40
   agricultural soils in the Netherlands. In particular, we test whether
   species richness, dominance structure and community nestedness are
   influenced by management type (in pairs of organically and
   conventionally farmed fields), and we examine the contribution of crop
   species (maize vs. potato), soil type (sand vs. clay-textured soils) and
   habitat (plant root vs. bulk soil) on AMF community characteristics. AMF
   richness varied from 1 to 11 taxa per field. Communities from
   species-poor fields were found to be subsets of those in richer fields,
   indicating nestedness and a progressive loss from the species pool. AMF
   taxa richness and occurrence in soil and plant roots were highly
   correlated, and richness was related to management intensity (phosphate
   availability and grass-cropping history together explained 32\% and 50\%
   of richness in roots and soils). Soil type together with soil chemical
   parameters explained only 17\% of variance in AMF community structure.
   We synthesize these results by discussing the potential contribution of
   a bottleneck effect on AMF communities through increased stochastic
   effects under environmental stress.}},

Abstract = {{Species range shifts in response to climate and land use change are
   commonly forecasted with species distribution models based on species
   occurrence or abundance data. Although appealing, these models ignore
   the genetic structure of species, and the fact that different
   populations might respond in different ways because of adaptation to
   their environment. Here, we introduced ancestry distribution models,
   that is, statistical models of the spatial distribution of ancestry
   proportions, for forecasting intra-specific changes based on genetic
   admixture instead of species occurrence data. Using multi-locus
   genotypes and extensive geographic coverage of distribution data across
   the European Alps, we applied this approach to 20 alpine plant species
   considering a global increase in temperature from 0.25 to 4 degrees C.
   We forecasted the magnitudes of displacement of contact zones between
   plant populations potentially adapted to warmer environments and other
   populations. While a global trend of movement in a north-east direction
   was predicted, the magnitude of displacement was species-specific. For a
   temperature increase of 2 degrees C, contact zones were predicted to
   move by 92 km on average (minimum of 5 km, maximum of 212 km) and by 188
   km for an increase of 4 degrees C (minimum of 11 km, maximum of 393 km).
   Intra-specific turnovermeasuring the extent of change in global
   population genetic structurewas generally found to be moderate for 2
   degrees C of temperature warming. For 4 degrees C of warming, however,
   the models indicated substantial intra-specific turnover for ten
   species. These results illustrate that, in spite of unavoidable
   simplifications, ancestry distribution models open new perspectives to
   forecast population genetic changes within species and complement more
   traditional distribution-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and changed land use have seriously reduced
   population size in many tropical forest tree species. Formerly
   widespread species with limited gene flow may be particularly vulnerable
   to the negative genetic effects of forest fragmentation and small
   population size. Vateriopsis seychellarum (Dipterocarpaceae) is a
   formerly widespread canopy tree of the Seychelles, but is now reduced to
   132 adult individuals distributed in eleven sites. Using ten
   microsatellite loci, a genetic inventory of all adult trees and a sample
   of 317 progeny, we demonstrate that despite its restricted range,
   overall genetic diversity was relatively high (HE: 0.56). The juvenile
   cohort, however, had significantly lower allelic richness (adults RS:
   3.91; juveniles RS: 2.83) and observed heterozygosity than adult trees
   (adults HO: 0.62; juveniles HO: 0.48). Rare alleles were fewer and
   kinship between individuals was stronger in juveniles. Significant
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure was observed in remnant adults, and
   parentage analysis indicated that more than 90\% of sampled progeny
   disperse <25 m and pollen dispersed <50 m. The molecular data confirmed
   that two populations were derived entirely from self-fertilized
   offspring from a single surviving mother tree. These populations produce
   viable offspring. Despite this extreme genetic bottleneck,
   self-compatibility may provide V. seychellarum with some resistance to
   the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation, at least in the short
   term. We discuss our findings in the context of other rare and
   threatened dipterocarp species which are vulnerable to miss-management
   of genetic resources and population fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of molecular epidemiology has greatly improved our ability to
   identify the population sources and track the pathogen movement. Yet the
   wide spatial and temporal scales usually considered are useful only to
   infer historical migration pathways. In this study, Bayesian genetic
   assignments and a landscape epidemiology approach were combined to
   unravel genetic origin and annual spread during a single epidemic of a
   plant pathogen: the poplar rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina. The
   study focused on a particular area-the Durance River valley-which
   enabled inoculum sources to be identified and channelled spread of the
   epidemic along a one-dimensional corridor. Spatio-temporal monitoring of
   disease showed that the epidemic began in the upstream part of the
   valley and spread out downstream. Using genetic assignment tests,
   individuals collected at the end of the epidemic were sorted into two
   genetic groups; very few hybrids were detected, although individuals
   from both groups coexisted locally downstream in the valley. The
   epidemic originated from two genetically distinct inoculum sources.
   Individuals of each group then dispersed southwards along the Durance
   River and became mixed in poplar riparian stands. These two genetic
   groups were found previously at a wider spatial scale and proved to
   result from distinct evolutionary histories on either wild or cultivated
   poplars. This study showed that the two groups can mix during an
   epidemic but do not hybridize because they then reproduce asexually. In
   general, the methods employed here could be useful for elucidating the
   genetic origin and retracing the colonization history and migration
   pathways of recent epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{In stream organisms, the landscape affecting intraspecific genetic and
   phenotypic divergence is comprised of two fundamental components: the
   stream network and terrestrial matrix. These components are known to
   differentially influence genetic structure in stream species, but to our
   knowledge, no study has compared their effects on genetic and phenotypic
   divergence. We examined how the stream network and terrestrial matrix
   affect genetic and phenotypic divergence in two stream salamanders,
   Gyrinophilus porphyriticus and Eurycea bislineata, in the Hubbard Brook
   Watershed, New Hampshire, USA. On the basis of previous findings and
   differences in adult terrestriality, we predicted that genetic
   divergence and phenotypic divergence in body morphology would be
   correlated in both species, but structured primarily by distance along
   the stream network in G. porphyriticus, and by overland distance in E.
   bislineata. Surprisingly, spatial patterns of genetic and phenotypic
   divergence were not strongly correlated. Genetic divergence, based on
   amplified DNA fragment length polymorphisms, increased with absolute
   geographic distance between sites. Phenotypic divergence was unrelated
   to absolute geographic distance, but related to relative stream vs.
   overland distances. In G. porphyriticus, phenotypic divergence was low
   when sites were close by stream distance alone and high when sites were
   close by overland distance alone. The opposite was true for E.
   bislineata. These results show that small differences in life history
   can produce large differences in patterns of intraspecific divergence,
   and the limitations of landscape genetic data for inferring phenotypic
   divergence. Our results also underscore the importance of explicitly
   comparing how terrestrial and aquatic conditions affect spatial patterns
   of divergence in species with biphasic life cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The unparalleled diversity of tropical ecosystems like the Amazon Basin
   has been traditionally explained using spatial models within the context
   of climatic and geological history. Yet, it is adaptive genetic
   diversity that defines how species evolve and interact within an
   ecosystem. Here, we combine genome scans, population genetics and
   sequence-based phylogeographic analyses to examine spatial and
   ecological arrangements of selected and neutrally evolving regions of
   the genome of an Amazonian fish, Triportheus albus. Using a sampling
   design encompassing five major Amazonian rivers, three hydrochemical
   settings, 352 nuclear markers and two mitochondrial DNA genes, we assess
   the influence of environmental gradients as biodiversity drivers in
   Amazonia. We identify strong divergent natural selection with gene flow
   and isolation by environment across craton (black and clear colour)- and
   Andean (white colour)-derived water types. Furthermore, we find that
   heightened selection and population genetic structure present at the
   interface of these water types appears more powerful in generating
   diversity than the spatial arrangement of river systems and vicariant
   biogeographic history. The results from our study challenge assumptions
   about the origin and distribution of adaptive and neutral genetic
   diversity in tropical ecosystems. In addition, they have important
   implications for measures of biodiversity and evolutionary potential in
   one of the worlds most diverse and iconic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{In the presence of environmental change, natural selection can shape the
   transcriptome. Under a scenario of environmental change, genotypes that
   are better able to modulate gene expression to maximize fitness will
   tend to be favoured. Therefore, it is important to examine gene
   expression at the population level to distinguish random or neutral gene
   expression variation from the pattern produced by natural selection.
   This study investigates the natural variation in transcriptional
   response to a cactus host shift utilizing the mainland Sonora population
   of Drosophila mojavensis. Drosophila mojavensis is a cactophilic species
   composed of four cactus host populations endemic to the deserts of North
   America. Overall, the change in cactus host was associated with a
   significant reduction in larval viability as well as the differential
   expression of 21\% of the genome (3109 genes). Among the genes
   identified were a set of genes previously known to be involved in
   xenobiotic metabolism, as well as genes involved in cellular energy
   production, oxidoreductase/carbohydrate metabolism, structural
   components and mRNA binding. Interestingly, of the 3109 genes whose
   expression was affected by host use, there was a significant
   overrepresentation of genes that lacked an orthologous call to the D.
   melanogaster genome, suggesting the possibility of an accelerated rate
   of evolution in these genes. Of the genes with a significant cactus
   effect, the majority, 2264 genes, did not exhibit a significant
   cactus-by-line interaction. This population-level approach facilitated
   the identification of genes involved in past cactus host shifts.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of ocean acidification (OA) on coral calcification, a subject
   of intense current interest, is poorly understood in part because of the
   presence of symbionts in adult corals. Early life history stages of
   Acropora spp. provide an opportunity to study the effects of elevated
   CO2 on coral calcification without the complication of symbiont
   metabolism. Therefore, we used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study the
   effects of acute exposure to elevated CO2 on gene expression in primary
   polyps of Acropora millepora, using as reference a novel comprehensive
   transcriptome assembly developed for this study. Gene ontology analysis
   of this whole transcriptome data set indicated that CO2-driven
   acidification strongly suppressed metabolism but enhanced extracellular
   organic matrix synthesis, whereas targeted analyses revealed complex
   effects on genes implicated in calcification. Unexpectedly, expression
   of most ion transport proteins was unaffected, while many
   membrane-associated or secreted carbonic anhydrases were expressed at
   lower levels. The most dramatic effect of CO2-driven acidification,
   however, was on genes encoding candidate and known components of the
   skeletal organic matrix that controls CaCO3 deposition. The skeletal
   organic matrix effects included elevated expression of adult-type
   galaxins and some secreted acidic proteins, but down-regulation of other
   galaxins, secreted acidic proteins, SCRiPs and other coral-specific
   genes, suggesting specialized roles for the members of these protein
   families and complex impacts of OA on mineral deposition. This study is
   the first exhaustive exploration of the transcriptomic response of a
   scleractinian coral to acidification and provides an unbiased
   perspective on its effects during the early stages of calcification.}},

Abstract = {{White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (HCN production after
   tissue damage), and this herbivore defence polymorphism has served as a
   classic model for studying adaptive variation. The cyanogenic phenotype
   requires two interacting biochemical components; the presence/absence of
   each component is controlled by a simple Mendelian gene (Ac/ac and
   Li/li). Climate-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native
   (Eurasian) and introduced populations worldwide, with cyanogenic plants
   predominating in warmer locations. Moreover, previous studies have
   suggested that epistatic selection may act within populations to
   maintain cyanogenic (AcLi) plants and acyanogenic plants that lack both
   components (acli plants) at the expense of plants possessing a single
   component (Acli and acLi plants). Here, we examine the roles of
   selection, gene flow and demography in the evolution of a latitudinal
   cyanogenesis cline in introduced North American populations. Using 1145
   plants sampled across a 1650 km transect, we determine the distribution
   of cyanogenesis variation across the central United States and
   investigate whether clinal variation is adaptive or an artefact of
   population introduction history. We also test for the evidence of
   epistatic selection. We detect a clear latitudinal cline, with
   cyanogenesis frequencies increasing from 11\% to 86\% across the
   transect. Population structure analysis using nine microsatellite loci
   indicates that the cline is adaptive and not a by-product of demographic
   history. However, we find no evidence for epistatic selection within
   populations. Our results provide strong evidence for rapid adaptive
   evolution in these introduced populations, and they further suggest that
   the mechanisms maintaining adaptive variation may vary among populations
   of a species.}},

Abstract = {{Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes encode proteins involved in

   test whether LRS is associated with within-individual MHC class II
   diversity. We also examined the association between MHC and infection
   with avian malaria. Using 454 sequencing, we found that individual
   flycatchers carry between 3 and 23 functional MHC class II B alleles.
   Predictions of the optimality hypothesis were not confirmed by our data
   as the prevalence of blood parasites decreased with functional MHC
   diversity. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for an association

Abstract = {{Highly expressed proteins can exhibit relatively small material costs,
   in terms of the quantities of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) or sulphur (S)
   atoms they contain. This elemental sparing probably reflects selection
   to reduce the quantities of potentially growth-limiting elements in
   abundant proteins, but the evolutionary mechanisms for adaptive
   elemental sparing are still poorly understood. Here, we predict that the
   extent of elemental sparing in highly expressed proteins will vary among
   organisms, according to the effectiveness of selection in determining
   the fate of mutations. We test this hypothesis in bacteria by asking
   whether elemental sparing is correlated with codon usage bias. Bacteria
   exhibit extraordinary variation in their life histories and demography
   and consequently in the effectiveness of selection in determining
   whether preferred codons are used in highly expressed genes. We find
   that C sparing and S sparing, but not N sparing, are significantly
   correlated with adaptive codon usage bias among 148 genera of bacteria,
   suggesting that selection for elemental sparing and codon bias are
   promoted by similar bacterial traits. Our study helps identify
   principles that determine how nutrient scarcity can shape the elemental
   composition of proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for unveiling the distribution
   and magnitude of genetic incompatibilities between hybridizing taxa. The
   nature of such incompatibilities is closely associated with the
   evolutionary histories of the parental species and may differ across
   tissues and between the sexes. In eusocial insects, the presence of
   castes that experience divergent selection regimes may result in
   additional distinct patterns of caste-specific hybrid incompatibilities.
   We analysed levels of expression of >14 000 genes in two life stages of
   each caste in the fire ants Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri
   and in their hybrids. We found strong contributions of both
   developmental stage and caste to gene expression patterns. In contrast,
   variability in expression was only weakly associated with taxonomic
   identity, with hybrid scores falling between those of the two parental
   species. Hybrid incompatibilities were surprisingly modest, with only 32
   genes being mis-expressed, indicating low levels of disruption in gene
   regulation in hybrids; males and workers each mis-expressed at least
   seven times as many genes as queens. Interestingly, homologues of many
   of the mis-expressed genes have been implicated in behavioural variation
   in Drosophila melanogaster. General expression profiles of hybrids
   consistently were more similar to those of S. richteri than S. invicta,
   presumably because S. richteri trans-regulatory elements tend to be
   dominant and/or because there is an overall bias in the genetic
   composition of the hybrids towards S. richteri. Altogether, our results
   suggest that selection acting on each caste may contribute differently
   to interspecific divergence and speciation in this group of ants.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling at appropriate spatial scales in the Southern Ocean is
   logistically challenging and may influence estimates of diversity by
   missing intermediate representatives. With the assistance of sampling
   efforts especially influenced by the International Polar Year 2007
   similar to 2008, we gathered nearly 1500 specimens of the crinoid
   species Promachocrinus kerguelensis from around Antarctica. We used
   phylogeographic and phylogenetic tools to assess its genetic diversity,
   demographic history and evolutionary relationships. Six phylogroups (A
   similar to F) identified in an earlier study are corroborated here, with
   the addition of one new phylogroup (E2). All phylogroups are
   circumpolar, sympatric and eurybathic. The phylogeny of Promachocrinus
   phylogroups reveals two principal clades that may represent two
   different cryptic species with contrasting demographic histories.
   Genetic diversity indices vary dramatically within phylogroups, and
   within populations, suggesting multiple glacial refugia in the Southern
   Ocean: on the Kerguelen Plateau, in the East Weddell Sea and the South
   Shetland Islands (Atlantic sector), and on the East Antarctic
   continental shelf in the Dumont dUrville Sea and Ross Sea. The
   inferences of gene flow vary among the phylogroups, showing discordant
   spatial patterns. Phylogroup A is the only one found in the
   Sub-Antarctic region, although without evident connectivity between
   Bouvet and Kerguelen populations. The Scotia Arc region shows high
   levels of connectivity between populations in most of the phylogroups,
   and barriers to gene flow are evident in East Antarctica.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogen introductions into novel areas can lead to the emergence of new
   fungal diseases of plants. Understanding the origin, introduction
   pathways, possible changes in reproductive system and population size of
   fungal pathogens is essential in devising an integrated strategy for the
   control of these diseases. We used minisatellite markers to infer the
   worldwide invasion history of the fungal plant pathogen Leptosphaeria
   maculans, which causes stem canker (blackleg) of oilseed and vegetable
   brassicas. Clustering analyses partitioned genotypes into distinct
   populations corresponding to major geographic regions, along with two
   differentiated populations in Western Canada. Comparison of invasion
   scenarios using Approximate Bayesian Computation suggested an origin of
   the pathogen in the USA, the region where epidemics were first recorded,
   and independent introductions from there over the last few decades into
   Eastern Canada (Ontario), Europe and Australia. The population in
   Western Canada appeared to be founded from a source in Ontario and the
   population in Chile resulted from an admixture between multiple sources.
   A bottleneck was inferred for the introduction into Western Canada but
   not into Europe, Ontario or Australia. Clonality appeared high in
   Western Canada, possibly because environmental conditions there were
   less conducive to sexual reproduction. Leptosphaeria maculans is a model
   invasive pathogen with contrasting features in different regions:
   shallow population structure, high genetic variability and regular
   sexual recombination in some regions, by comparison with reduced genetic
   variability, high rates of asexual multiplication, strong population
   structure or admixture in others.}},

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic tissues, the major food source of many invertebrates and
   vertebrates, are well defended. Many defence traits in leaves are
   controlled via the jasmonate signalling pathway in which jasmonate acts
   as a hormone by binding to a receptor to activate responses that lead to
   increased resistance to invertebrate folivores. We predicted that
   mutations in jasmonate synthesis might also increase the vulnerability
   of leaves to vertebrate folivores and tested this hypothesis using the
   Eastern Hermanns tortoise (Eurotestudo boettgeri) and an Arabidopsis
   thaliana (Brassicaceae) allene oxide synthase (aos) mutant unable to
   synthesize jasmonate. Tortoises preferred the aos mutant over the wild
   type (WT). Based on these results, we then investigated the effect of
   mutating jasmonate perception using a segregating population of the
   recessive A. thaliana jasmonate receptor mutant coronatine
   insensitive1-1 (coi1-1). Genotyping of these plants after tortoise
   feeding revealed that the homozygous coi1-1 receptor mutant was consumed
   more readily than the heterozygous mutant or the WT. Therefore, the
   plants ability to synthesize or perceive jasmonate reduces feeding by a
   vertebrate herbivore. We also tested whether or not tortoise feeding
   behaviour was influenced by glucosinolates, the principal defence
   chemicals in Arabidopsis leaves with known roles in defence against many
   generalist insects. However, in contrast to what has been observed with
   such insects, leaves in which the levels of these compounds were reduced
   genetically were consumed at a similar rate to those of the WT.}},

Abstract = {{Although genetic diversity is very important for alien species, which
   have to cope with new environments, little is known about the role that
   genetic diversity plays in their invasive success. In this study, we set
   up a manipulation experiment including three levels of genotypic
   diversity to test whether genotypic diversity can enhance the invasive
   ability of alien species, in our case the invasive Spartina alterniflora
   in China, and to infer the underlying mechanisms. There was no
   significant relationship between genotypic diversity and parameters of
   performance in the first year; however, from the summer of the second
   year onwards, genotypic diversity enhanced four of the six parameters of
   performance. After two growing seasons, there were significant positive
   relationships between genotypic diversity and maximum spread distance,
   patch size, shoot number per patch, and aboveground biomass. Moreover,
   abundance of the native dominant species Scirpus mariqueter was
   marginally significantly decreased with genotypic diversity of S.
   alterniflora, suggesting that enhanced invasive ability of S.
   alterniflora may have depressed the growth of the native species. There
   was no significant difference in most measures of performance among six
   genotypes, but we observed a transgressive over performance in four
   measures in multiple-genotype patches. At the end of the experiment,
   there were significant nonadditive effects of genotypic diversity
   according to Monte Carlo permutations, in six-genotype, but not
   three-genotype plots. Our results indicated that both additive and
   nonadditive effects played roles in the positive relationship between
   genetic diversity and invasion success, and nonadditive effects were
   stronger as duration increased.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how natural populations adapt to their local environments
   is a major research theme for ecological genomics. This endeavour begins
   by sleuthing for shared genetic similarities among unrelated natural
   populations sharing adaptive traits to documented selective pressures.
   When the selective pressures have low dimensionality, and the genetic
   response is localized to a few genes of major effect, this detective
   work is relatively straightforward. However, in the real world,
   populations face a complex mixture of selective pressures and many
   adaptive responses are the result of changes in quantitative traits that
   have a polygenic genetic basis. This complex relationship between
   environment and adaptation presents a significant challenge. How can we
   begin to identify drivers of adaptation in natural settings? In this
   issue of Molecular Ecology, Orsini (2012) take advantage of the
   biological attributes of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia
   (Fig.similar to 1) to disentangle multidimensional selections signature
   on the genome of populations that have repeatedly evolved adaptive
   responses to isolated selective pressures including predation,
   parasitism and anthropogenic changes in land use. Orsini (2012) leverage
   a powerful combination of spatially structured populations in a
   geographic mosaic of environmental stressors, the historical archive of
   past genotypes preserved in lake-bottom sediments and selection
   experiments to identify sets of candidate genomic regions associated
   with adaptation in response to these three environmental stressors. This
   study provides a template for future investigation in ecological
   genomics, combining multiple experimental approaches with the genomic
   investigation of a well-studied ecological model species.}},

Abstract = {{Ants are quite possibly the most successful insects on Earth, with an
   estimated 10 000 species worldwide, making up at least a third of the
   global insect biomass, and comprising several times the biomass of all
   land vertebrates combined. Ant species have diverse trophic habits,
   including herbivory, hunting/gathering, scavenging and predation and are
   distributed in diverse habitats, performing a variety of important
   ecosystem functions. Often they exert these functions while engaging in
   symbiotic associations with other insects, plants or microbes; however,
   remarkably little work has focused on the potential contribution of the
   ants gut symbionts. This issue of Molecular Ecology contains a study by
   Anderson (2012), who take a comparative approach to explore the link
   between trophic levels and ant microbiomes, specifically, to address
   three main questions: (i) Do closely related herbivorous ants share
   similar bacterial communities? (ii) Do species of predatory ants share
   similar bacterial communities? (iii) Do distantly related herbivorous
   ants tend to share similar bacterial communities? By doing so, the
   authors demonstrate that ants with similar trophic habits appear to have
   relatively conserved gut microbiomes, suggesting symbiont functions that
   directly relate to dietary preference of the ant host. These findings
   suggest an ecological role of gut symbionts in ants, for example, in
   metabolism and/or protection, and the comparative approach taken
   supports a model of co-evolution between ant species and specific core
   symbiont microbiomes. This study, thereby, highlights the omnipresence
   and importance of gut symbiosesalso in the Hymenopteraand suggests that
   these hitherto overlooked microbes likely have contributed to the
   ecological success of the ants.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evolution (EE) combined with whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
   has become a compelling approach to study the fundamental mechanisms and
   processes that drive evolution. Most EE-WGS studies published to date
   have used microbes, owing to their ease of propagation and manipulation
   in the laboratory and relatively small genome sizes. These experiments
   are particularly suited to answer long-standing questions such as: How
   many mutations underlie adaptive evolution, and how are they distributed
   across the genome and through time? Are there general rules or
   principles governing which genes contribute to adaptation, and are
   certain kinds of genes more likely to be targets than others? How common
   is epistasis among adaptive mutations, and what does this reveal about
   the variety of genetic routes to adaptation? How common is parallel
   evolution, where the same mutations evolve repeatedly and independently
   in response to similar selective pressures? Here, we summarize the
   significant findings of this body of work, identify important emerging
   trends and propose promising directions for future research. We also
   outline an example of a computational pipeline for use in EE-WGS

Abstract = {{Isolation by adaptation increases divergence at neutral loci when
   natural selection against immigrants reduces the rate of gene flow
   between different habitats. This can occur early in the process of
   adaptive divergence and is a key feature of ecological speciation.
   Despite the ability of isolation by distance (IBD) and other forms of
   landscape resistance to produce similar patterns of neutral divergence
   within species, few studies have used landscape genetics to control for
   these other forces. We have studied the divergence of Helianthus
   petiolaris ecotypes living in active sand dunes and adjacent non-dune
   habitat, using landscape genetics approaches, such as circuit theory and
   multiple regression of distance matrices, in addition to coalescent
   modelling. Divergence between habitats was significant, but not strong,
   and was shaped by IBD. We expected that increased resistance owing to
   patchy and unfavourable habitat in the dunes would contribute to
   divergence. Instead, we found that landscape resistance models with
   lower resistance in the dunes performed well as predictors of genetic
   distances among subpopulations. Nevertheless, habitat class remained a
   strong predictor of genetic distance when controlling for isolation by
   resistance and IBD. We also measured environmental variables at each
   site and confirmed that specific variables, especially soil nitrogen and
   vegetation cover, explained a greater proportion of variance in genetic
   distance than did landscape or the habitat classification alone.
   Asymmetry in effective population sizes and numbers of migrants per
   generation was detected using coalescent modelling with Bayesian
   inference, which is consistent with incipient ecological speciation
   being driven by the dune habitat.}},

Title = {{Genetic spatial autocorrelation can readily detect sex-biased dispersal}},

Abstract = {{Sex-biased dispersal is expected to generate differences in the
   fine-scale genetic structure of males and females. Therefore, spatial
   analyses of multilocus genotypes may offer a powerful approach for
   detecting sex-biased dispersal in natural populations. However, the
   effects of sex-biased dispersal on fine-scale genetic structure have not
   been explored. We used simulations and multilocus spatial
   autocorrelation analysis to investigate how sex-biased dispersal
   influences fine-scale genetic structure. We evaluated three statistical
   tests for detecting sex-biased dispersal: bootstrap confidence intervals
   about autocorrelation r values and recently developed heterogeneity
   tests at the distance class and whole correlogram levels. Even modest
   sex bias in dispersal resulted in significantly different fine-scale
   spatial autocorrelation patterns between the sexes. This was
   particularly evident when dispersal was strongly restricted in the
   less-dispersing sex (mean distance <200 m), when differences between the
   sexes were readily detected over short distances. All tests had high
   power to detect sex-biased dispersal with large sample sizes (n = 250).
   However, there was variation in type I error rates among the tests, for
   which we offer specific recommendations. We found congruence between
   simulation predictions and empirical data from the agile antechinus, a
   species that exhibits male-biased dispersal, confirming the power of
   individual-based genetic analysis to provide insights into asymmetries
   in male and female dispersal. Our key recommendations for using
   multilocus spatial autocorrelation analyses to test for sex-biased
   dispersal are: (i) maximize sample size, not locus number; (ii)
   concentrate sampling within the scale of positive structure; (iii)
   evaluate several distance class sizes; (iv) use appropriate methods when
   combining data from multiple populations; (v) compare the appropriate
   groups of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The divergence-with-gene-flow model of speciation has a strong
   theoretical basis with a growing number of plausible examples in nature,
   but remains hotly debated. Darwins finches of the Galapagos Archipelago
   have played an important role in our understanding of speciation
   processes. Recent studies suggest that this group may also provide
   insights into speciation via divergence with gene flow. On the island of
   Santa Cruz, recent studies found evidence for adaptive divergence in
   Darwins small ground finch, Geospiza fuliginosa, between ecologically
   contrasting arid and humid zones. Despite the short geographical
   distance between these zones, strong disruptive selection during low
   rainfall periods is expected to generate and maintain adaptive
   divergence. Conversely, during high rainfall periods, when disruptive
   selection is predicted to be weakened, population divergence in adaptive
   traits is expected to break down. Because periods of low and high
   rainfall irregularly alternate, the geographical pattern of adaptive
   divergence can be assumed to break down and, importantly, regenerate in
   situ. Here, we use microsatellite allele frequency data to assess the
   genetic population structure of G. fuliginosa on Santa Cruz. We sample
   21 sites and four ecological zones across the island. We reject
   hypotheses of population substructure linked to ecological and
   geographical differences among sites in favour of a single panmictic
   population. Panmixia implies high levels of gene flow within Santa Cruz,
   which favours selection over genetic drift as a valid process generating
   phenotypic divergence in G. fuliginosa on Santa Cruz. We discuss how our
   findings may support classic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, matching
   habitat choice or any combination of these three processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we characterize and compare the genetic structure of
   aboveground and belowground populations of the ectomycorrhizal fungus
   Laccaria amethystina in an unmanaged mixed beech forest. Fruiting bodies
   and mycorrhizas of L.similar to amethystina were mapped and collected in
   four plots in the Swietokrzyskie Mountains (Poland). A total of 563
   fruiting bodies and 394 mycorrhizas were successfully genotyped using
   the rDNA IGS1 (intergenic spacer) and seven simple sequence repeat
   markers. We identified two different genetic clusters of L.similar to
   amethystina in all of the plots, suggesting that a process of sympatric
   isolation may be occurring at a local scale. The proportion of
   individuals belonging to each cluster was similar among plots
   aboveground while it significantly differed belowground. Predominance of
   a given cluster could be explained by distinct host preferences or by
   priority effects and competition among genets. Both aboveground and
   belowground populations consisted of many intermingling small genets.
   Consequently, host trees were simultaneously colonized by many L.similar
   to amethystina genets that may show different ecophysiological
   abilities. Our data showed that several genets may last for at least 1
   year belowground and sustain into the next season. Ectomycorrhizal
   species reproducing by means of spores can form highly diverse and
   persistent belowground genets that may provide the host tree with higher
   resilience in a changing environment and enhance ecosystem performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the population genetics of the Russian wheat
   aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia), one of the worlds most invasive
   agricultural pests, in north-western China. We have analysed the data of
   10 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial sequences from 27 populations
   sampled over 2 years in China. The results confirm that the RWAs are
   holocyclic in China with high genetic diversity indicating widespread
   sexual reproduction. Distinct differences in microsatellite genetic
   diversity and distribution revealed clear geographic isolation between
   RWA populations in northern and southern Xinjiang, China, with gene flow
   interrupted across extensive desert regions. Despite frequent grain
   transportation from north to south in this region, little evidence for
   RWA translocation as a result of human agricultural activities was
   found. Consequently, frequent gene flow among northern populations most
   likely resulted from natural dispersal, potentially facilitated by wind
   currents. We also found evidence for the long-term existence and
   expansion of RWAs in China, despite local opinion that it is an exotic
   species only present in China since 1975. Our estimated date of RWA
   expansion throughout China coincides with the debut of wheat
   domestication and cultivation practices in western Asia in the Holocene.
   We conclude that western China represents the limit of the far eastern
   native range of this species. This study is the most comprehensive
   molecular genetic investigation of the RWA in its native range
   undertaken to date and provides valuable insights into the history of
   the association of this aphid with domesticated cereals and wild
   grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Many marine species have vastly different capacities for dispersal
   during larval, juvenile and adult life stages, and this has the
   potential to complicate the identification of population boundaries and
   the implementation of effective management strategies such as marine
   protected areas. Genetic studies of population structure and dispersal
   rarely disentangle these differences and usually provide only
   lifetime-averaged information that can be considered by managers. We
   address this limitation by combining age-specific autocorrelation
   analysis of microsatellite genotypes, hydrodynamic modelling and genetic
   simulations to reveal changes in the extent of dispersal during the
   lifetime of a marine fish. We focus on an exploited coral reef species,
   Lethrinus nebulosus, which has a circum-tropical distribution and is a
   key component of a multispecies fishery in northwestern Australia.
   Conventional population genetic analyses revealed extensive gene flow in
   this species over vast distances (up to 1500 km). Yet, when realistic
   adult dispersal behaviours were modelled, they could not account for
   these observations, implying adult dispersal does not dominate gene
   flow. Instead, hydrodynamic modelling showed that larval L.similar to
   nebulosus are likely to be transported hundreds of kilometres, easily
   accounting for the observed gene flow. Despite the vast scale of larval
   transport, juvenile L.similar to nebulosus exhibited fine-scale genetic
   autocorrelation, which declined with age. This implies both larval
   cohesion and extremely limited juvenile dispersal prior to maturity. The
   multidisciplinary approach adopted in this study provides a uniquely
   comprehensive insight into spatial processes in this marine fish.}},

Abstract = {{Natural populations are confronted with multiple selection pressures
   resulting in a mosaic of environmental stressors at the landscape level.
   Identifying the genetic underpinning of adaptation to these complex
   selection environments and assigning causes of natural selection within
   multidimensional selection regimes in the wild is challenging. The water
   flea Daphnia is a renowned ecological model system with its
   well-documented ecology, the possibility to analyse subfossil dormant
   egg banks and the short generation time allowing an experimental
   evolution approach. Capitalizing on the strengths of this model system,
   we here link candidate genome regions to three selection pressures,
   known to induce micro-evolutionary responses in Daphnia magna: fish
   predation, parasitism and land use. Using a genome scan approach in
   space, time and experimental evolution trials, we provide solid evidence
   of selection at the genome level under well-characterized environmental
   gradients in the wild and identify candidate genes linked to the three
   environmental stressors. Our study reveals differential selection at the
   genome level in Daphnia populations and provides evidence for repeatable
   patterns of local adaptation in a geographic mosaic of environmental
   stressors fuelled by standing genetic variation. Our results imply high
   evolutionary potential of local populations, which is relevant to
   understand the dynamics of trait changes in natural populations and
   their impact on community and ecosystem responses through
   eco-evolutionary feedbacks.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that selection on the opsin gene is efficient in tuning
   vision to the ambient light environment of an organism was assessed in
   49 populations of 12 Mysis crustacean species, inhabiting arctic marine
   waters, coastal littoral habitats, freshwater lakes (glacial relicts)
   and the deep Caspian Sea. Extensive sequence variation was found within
   and among taxa, but its patterns did not match expectations based on
   light environments, spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment measured
   by microspectrophotometry or the history of species and populations. The
   main split in the opsin gene tree was between lineages I and II,
   differing in six amino acids. Lineage I was present in marine and
   Caspian Sea species and in the North American freshwater Mysis
   diluviana, whereas lineage II was found in the European and circumarctic
   fresh- and brackish-water Mysis relicta, Mysis salemaai and Mysis
   segerstralei. Both lineages were present in some populations of
   M.similar to salemaai and M.similar to segerstralei. Absorbance spectra
   of the visual pigment in nine populations of the latter three species
   showed a dichotomy between lake (?max = 554562 nm) and brackish-water
   (Baltic Sea) populations (?max = 521535 nm). Judged by the shape of
   spectra, this difference was not because of different chromophores (A2
   vs. A1), but neither did it coincide with the split in the opsin tree
   (lineages I/II), species identity or current light environments. In all,
   adaptive evolution of the opsin gene in Mysis could not be demonstrated,
   but its sequence variation did not conform to a neutral expectation
   either, suggesting evolutionary constraints and/or unidentified
   mechanisms of spectral tuning.}},

Abstract = {{When a phenotypic trait is subjected to spatially variable selection and
   local adaptation, the underlying genes controlling the trait are also
   expected to show strong patterns of genetic differentiation because
   alternative alleles are favoured in different geographical locations.
   Here, we study 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from seven
   genes associated with inducible defence responses in a sample of Populus
   tremula collected from across Sweden. Four of these genes (PPO2, TI2,
   TI4 and TI5) show substantial population differentiation, and a
   principal component analyses conducted on the defence SNPs divides the
   Swedish population into three distinct clusters. Several defence SNPs
   show latitudinal clines, although these were not robust to multiple
   testing. However, five SNPs (located within TI4 and TI5) show strong
   longitudinal clines that remain significant after multiple test
   correction. Genetic geographical variation, supporting local adaptation,
   has earlier been confirmed in genes involved in the photoperiod pathway
   in P.similar to tremula, but this is, to our knowledge, one of the first
   times that geographical variation has been found in genes involved in
   plant defence against antagonists.}},

Abstract = {{The fungus Pisolithus albus forms ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations
   with plants growing on extreme ultramafic soils, which are naturally
   rich in heavy metals such as nickel. Both nickel-tolerant and
   nickel-sensitive isolates of P.similar to albus are found in ultramafic
   soils in New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot in the Southwest Pacific.
   The aim of this work was to monitor the expression of genes involved in
   the specific molecular response to nickel in a nickel-tolerant P.similar
   to albus isolate. We used pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (qPCR) approaches to investigate and compare the
   transcriptomes of the nickel-tolerant isolate MD06-337 in the presence
   and absence of nickel. A total of 1 071 375 sequencing reads were
   assembled to infer expression patterns of 19 518 putative genes.
   Comparison of expression levels revealed that 30\% of the identified
   genes were modulated by nickel treatment. The genes, for which
   expression was induced most markedly by nickel, encoded products that
   were putatively involved in a variety of biological functions, such as
   the modification of cellular components (53\%), regulation of biological
   processes (27\%) and molecular functions (20\%). The 10 genes that
   pyrosequencing analysis indicated were induced the most by nickel were
   characterized further by qPCR analysis of both nickel-tolerant and
   nickel-sensitive P.similar to albus isolates. Five of these genes were
   expressed exclusively in nickel-tolerant isolates as well as in ECM
   samples in situ, which identified them as potential biomarkers for
   nickel tolerance in this species. These results clearly suggest a
   positive transcriptomic response of the fungus to nickel-rich
   environments. The presence of both nickel-tolerant and nickel-sensitive
   fungal phenotypes in ultramafic soils might reflect
   environment-dependent phenotypic responses to variations in the
   effective concentrations of nickel in heterogeneous ultramafic habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of species is one of the most basic, and yet
   critically important, issues in biology with far-reaching potential
   implications for fields such as biodiversity conservation, population
   ecology and epidemiology. Morphology has long been the primary tool
   biologists have used to categorize life. However, we now know that a
   significant portion of natural diversity is morphologically hidden, and
   therefore, we must integrate nonmorphological tools into the description
   of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the utility of multilocus
   population genetic data for identifying and characterizing cryptic
   species complexes, even when species share large amounts of genetic
   variability. Specifically, we have used DNA sequence data from 12
   genomic regions to characterize two widespread species complexes in the
   coral genus Acropora: A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus. These two
   morphospecies have each been sampled from 5 to 7 locations throughout
   their Indo-Pacific distributions, and with the use of structure and
   hierarchical clustering, we demonstrate the presence of at least six
   widespread cryptic species within these two morphospecies complexes.
   After identifying cryptic lineages, we then utilize the genetic data to
   examine the history of introgressive hybridization within and between
   these morphospecies complexes. Our data indicate that these two
   complexes form a global syngameon with consistent patterns of
   introgression between species across large geographic distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Hispaniola is a geotectonically complex island consisting of two
   palaeo-islands that docked c. 10 Ma, with a further geological boundary
   subdividing the southern palaeo-island into eastern and western regions.
   All three regions have been isolated by marine barriers during the late
   Cenozoic and possess biogeographically distinct terrestrial biotas.
   However, there is currently little evidence to indicate whether
   Hispaniolan mammals show distributional patterns reflecting this
   geotectonic history, as the islands endemic land mammal fauna is now
   almost entirely extinct. We obtained samples of Hispaniolan hutia
   (Plagiodontia aedium), one of the two surviving Hispaniolan land mammal
   species, through fieldwork and historical museum collections from seven
   localities distributed across all three of the islands biogeographic
   regions. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b)
   reveals a pattern of historical allopatric lineage divergence in this
   species, with the spatial distribution of three distinct hutia lineages
   biogeographically consistent with the islands geotectonic history.
   Coalescent modelling, approximate Bayesian computation and approximate
   Bayes factor analyses support our phylogenetic inferences, indicating
   near-complete genetic isolation of these biogeographically separate
   populations and differing estimates of their effective population sizes.
   Spatial congruence of hutia lineage divergence is not however matched by
   temporal congruence with divergences in other Hispaniolan taxa or major
   events in Hispaniolas geotectonic history; divergence between northern
   and southern hutia lineages dates to c. 0.6 Ma, significantly later than
   the unification of the palaeo-islands. The three allopatric Plagiodontia
   populations should all be treated as distinct management units for
   conservation, with particular attention required for the northern
   population (low haplotype diversity) and the south-western population
   (high haplotype diversity but highly threatened).}},

Abstract = {{The monsoon tropics of northern Australia are a globally significant
   biodiversity hotspot, but its phylogeography is poorly known. A major
   challenge for this region is to understand the biogeographical processes
   that have shaped the distribution and diversity of taxa, without
   detailed knowledge of past climatic and environmental fluctuations.
   Although molecular data have great potential to address these questions,
   only a few species have been examined phylogeographically. Here, we use
   the widely distributed and abundant short-eared rock-wallaby (Petrogale
   brachyotis; n = 101), together with the sympatric monjon (P. burbidgei;
   n = 11) and nabarlek (P. concinna; n = 1), to assess historical
   evolutionary and biogeographical processes in northern Australia. We
   sequenced 1000 bp of mitochondrial DNA (control region, ND2) and 3000 bp
   of nDNA (BRCA1, ?-globin and two anonymous loci) to investigate
   phylogeographic structuring and delineate the time-scale of
   diversification within the region. Our results indicate multiple
   barriers between the Top End (Northern Territory) and Kimberley (Western
   Australia), which have caused divergence throughout the
   Plio-Pleistocene. Eight geographically discrete and genetically distinct
   lineages within the brachyotis group were identified, five of which are
   separated by major river valleys (Ord, Victoria, Daly), arid lowlands
   and discontinuous sandstone ranges. It is likely that these barriers
   have similarly influenced genetic structure in other monsoonal biota.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation can have important consequences for populations: high
   population genetic diversity is typically associated with ecological
   success. Some mechanisms that account for these benefits assume that
   local social groups with high genetic diversity are more successful than
   low-diversity groups. At the same time, active decision-making by
   individuals can influence group genetic diversity. Here, we examine how
   maternal decisions that determine group genetic diversity influence the
   viability of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Our groups contained
   wild-type larvae, whose genetic diversity we manipulated, and
   genetically marked tester larvae, whose genotype and frequency were
   identical in all trials. We measured wild-type and tester viability for
   each group. Surprisingly, the viability of wild-type larvae was neither
   augmented nor reduced when group genetic diversity was altered. However,
   the viability of the tester genotype was substantially depressed in
   large, high-diversity groups. Further, not all high-diversity groups
   produced this effect: certain combinations of wild-type genotypes were
   deleterious to tester viability, while other groups of the same
   diversitybut containing different wild-type genotypeswere not
   deleterious. These deleterious combinations of wild-type genotypes could
   not be predicted by observing the performance of the same tester and
   wild-type genotypes in low-diversity groups. Taken together, these
   results suggest that nonadditive interactions among genotypes, rather
   than genetic diversity per se, account for between-group differences in
   viability in D.similar to melanogaster and that predicting the
   consequences of genetic diversity at the population level may not be
   straightforward.}},

Abstract = {{Ants dominate many terrestrial ecosystems, yet we know little about
   their nutritional physiology and ecology. While traditionally viewed as
   predators and scavengers, recent isotopic studies revealed that many
   dominant ant species are functional herbivores. As with other insects
   with nitrogen-poor diets, it is hypothesized that these ants rely on
   symbiotic bacteria for nutritional supplementation. In this study, we
   used cloning and 16S sequencing to further characterize the bacterial
   flora of several herbivorous ants, while also examining the beta
   diversity of bacterial communities within and between ant species from
   different trophic levels. Through estimating phylogenetic overlap
   between these communities, we tested the hypothesis that ecologically or
   phylogenetically similar groups of ants harbor similar microbial flora.
   Our findings reveal: (i) clear differences in bacterial communities
   harbored by predatory and herbivorous ants; (ii) notable similarities
   among communities from distantly related herbivorous ants and (iii)
   similar communities shared by different predatory army ant species.
   Focusing on one herbivorous ant tribe, the Cephalotini, we detected five
   major bacterial taxa that likely represent the core microbiota.
   Metabolic functions of bacterial relatives suggest that these microbes
   may play roles in fixing, recycling, or upgrading nitrogen. Overall, our
   findings reveal that similar microbial communities are harbored by ants
   from similar trophic niches and, to a greater extent, by related ants
   from the same colonies, species, genera, and tribes. These trends hint
   at coevolved histories between ants and microbes, suggesting new
   possibilities for roles of bacteria in the evolution of both herbivores
   and carnivores from the ant family Formicidae.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes transmit numerous arboviruses including dengue and
   chikungunya virus (CHIKV). In recent years, mosquito species Aedes
   albopictus has expanded in the Indian Ocean region and was the principal
   vector of chikungunya outbreaks in La Reunion and neighbouring islands
   in 2005 and 2006. Vector-associated bacteria have recently been found to
   interact with transmitted pathogens. For instance, Wolbachia modulates
   the replication of viruses or parasites. However, there has been no
   systematic evaluation of the diversity of the entire bacterial
   populations within mosquito individuals particularly in relation to
   virus invasion. Here, we investigated the effect of CHIKV infection on
   the whole bacterial community of Ae. albopictus. Taxonomic microarrays
   and quantitative PCR showed that members of Alpha- and
   Gammaproteobacteria phyla, as well as Bacteroidetes, responded to CHIKV
   infection. The abundance of bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family
   increased with CHIKV infection, whereas the abundance of known insect
   endosymbionts like Wolbachia and Blattabacterium decreased. Our results
   clearly link the pathogen propagation with changes in the dynamics of
   the bacterial community, suggesting that cooperation or competition
   occurs within the host, which may in turn affect the mosquito traits
   like vector competence.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2005, advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have
   revolutionized biological science. The analysis of environmental DNA
   through the use of specific gene markers such as species-specific DNA
   barcodes has been a key application of next-generation sequencing
   technologies in ecological and environmental research. Access to
   parallel, massive amounts of sequencing data, as well as subsequent
   improvements in read length and throughput of different sequencing
   platforms, is leading to a better representation of sample diversity at
   a reasonable cost. New technologies are being developed rapidly and have
   the potential to dramatically accelerate ecological and environmental
   research. The fast pace of development and improvements in
   next-generation sequencing technologies can reflect on broader and more
   robust applications in environmental DNA research. Here, we review the
   advantages and limitations of current next-generation sequencing
   technologies in regard to their application for environmental DNA

Abstract = {{Analyses of degraded DNA are typically hampered by contamination,
   especially when employing universal primers such as commonly used in
   environmental DNA studies. In addition to false-positive results, the
   amplification of contaminant DNA may cause false-negative results
   because of competition, or bias, during the PCR. In this study, we test
   the utility of human-specific blocking primers in mammal diversity
   analyses of ancient permafrost samples from Siberia. Using quantitative
   PCR (qPCR) on human and mammoth DNA, we first optimized the design and
   concentration of blocking primer in the PCR. Subsequently, 454
   pyrosequencing of ancient permafrost samples amplified with and without
   the addition of blocking primer revealed that DNA sequences from a
   diversity of mammalian representatives of the Beringian megafauna were
   retrieved only when the blocking primer was added to the PCR. Notably,
   we observe the first retrieval of woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta
   antiquitatis) DNA from ancient permafrost cores. In contrast, reactions
   without blocking primer resulted in complete dominance by human DNA
   sequences. These results demonstrate that in ancient environmental
   analyses, the PCR can be biased towards the amplification of contaminant
   sequences to such an extent that retrieval of the endogenous DNA is
   severely restricted. The application of blocking primers is a promising
   tool to avoid this bias and can greatly enhance the quantity and the
   diversity of the endogenous DNA sequences that are amplified.}},

Abstract = {{DNA metabarcoding refers to the DNA-based identification of multiple
   species from a single complex and degraded environmental sample. We
   developed new sampling and extraction protocols suitable for DNA
   metabarcoding analyses targeting soil extracellular DNA. The proposed
   sampling protocol has been designed to reduce, as much as possible, the
   influence of local heterogeneity by processing a large amount of soil
   resulting from the mixing of many different cores. The DNA extraction is
   based on the use of saturated phosphate buffer. The sampling and
   extraction protocols were validated first by analysing plant DNA from a
   set of 12 plots corresponding to four plant communities in alpine
   meadows, and, second, by conducting pilot experiments on fungi and
   earthworms. The results of the validation experiments clearly
   demonstrated that sound biological information can be retrieved when
   following these sampling and extraction procedures. Such a protocol can
   be implemented at any time of the year without any preliminary knowledge
   of specific types of organisms during the sampling. It offers the
   opportunity to analyse all groups of organisms using a single
   sampling/extraction procedure and opens the possibility to fully
   standardize biodiversity surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Metabarcoding approaches use total and typically degraded DNA from
   environmental samples to analyse biotic assemblages and can potentially
   be carried out for any kinds of organisms in an ecosystem. These
   analyses rely on specific markers, here called metabarcodes, which
   should be optimized for taxonomic resolution, minimal bias in
   amplification of the target organism group and short sequence length.
   Using bioinformatic tools, we developed metabarcodes for several groups
   of organisms: fungi, bryophytes, enchytraeids, beetles and birds. The
   ability of these metabarcodes to amplify the target groups was
   systematically evaluated by (i) in silico PCRs using all standard
   sequences in the EMBL public database as templates, (ii) in vitro PCRs
   of DNA extracts from surface soil samples from a site in Varanger,
   northern Norway and (iii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from permanently
   frozen sediment samples of late-Pleistocene age (similar to 16 00050 000
   years bp) from two Siberian sites, Duvanny Yar and Main River.
   Comparison of the results from the in silico PCR with those obtained in
   vitro showed that the in silico approach offered a reliable estimate of
   the suitability of a marker. All target groups were detected in the
   environmental DNA, but we found large variation in the level of
   detection among the groups and between modern and ancient samples.
   Success rates for the Pleistocene samples were highest for fungal DNA,
   whereas bryophyte, beetle and bird sequences could also be retrieved,
   but to a much lesser degree. The metabarcoding approach has considerable
   potential for biodiversity screening of modern samples and also as a
   palaeoecological tool.}},

Abstract = {{Almost all empirical studies in ecology have to identify the species
   involved in the ecological process under examination. DNA metabarcoding,
   which couples the principles of DNA barcoding with next generation
   sequencing technology, provides an opportunity to easily produce large
   amounts of data on biodiversity. Microbiologists have long used
   metabarcoding approaches, but use of this technique in the assessment of
   biodiversity in plant and animal communities is under-explored. Despite
   its relationship with DNA barcoding, several unique features of DNA
   metabarcoding justify the development of specific data analysis
   methodologies. In this review, we describe the bioinformatics tools
   available for DNA metabarcoding of plants and animals, and we revisit
   others developed for DNA barcoding or microbial metabarcoding. We also
   discuss the principles and associated tools for evaluating and comparing
   DNA barcodes in the context of DNA metabarcoding, for designing new
   custom-made barcodes adapted to specific ecological question, for
   dealing with PCR and sequencing errors, and for inferring taxonomical
   data from sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable assignment of an unknown query sequence to its correct species
   remains a methodological problem for the growing field of DNA barcoding.
   While great advances have been achieved recently, species identification
   from barcodes can still be unreliable if the relevant biodiversity has
   been insufficiently sampled. We here propose a new notion of species
   membership for DNA barcodingfuzzy membership, based on fuzzy set
   theoryand illustrate its successful application to four real data sets
   (bats, fishes, butterflies and flies) with more than 5000 random
   simulations. Two of the data sets comprise especially dense
   species/population-level samples. In comparison with current DNA
   barcoding methods, the newly proposed minimum distance (MD) plus fuzzy
   set approach, and another computationally simple method, best close
   match, outperform two computationally sophisticated Bayesian and
   BootstrapNJ methods. The new method proposed here has great power in
   reducing false-positive species identification compared with other
   methods when conspecifics of the query are absent from the reference
   database.}},

Abstract = {{Within uncharacterized groups, DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences that
   are present in a wide range of species, can be used to assign organisms
   into species. We propose an automatic procedure that sorts the sequences
   into hypothetical species based on the barcode gap, which can be
   observed whenever the divergence among organisms belonging to the same
   species is smaller than divergence among organisms from different
   species. We use a range of prior intraspecific divergence to infer from
   the data a model-based one-sided confidence limit for intraspecific
   divergence. The method, called Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD),
   then detects the barcode gap as the first significant gap beyond this
   limit and uses it to partition the data. Inference of the limit and gap
   detection are then recursively applied to previously obtained groups to
   get finer partitions until there is no further partitioning. Using six
   published data sets of metazoans, we show that ABGD is computationally
   efficient and performs well for standard prior maximum intraspecific
   divergences (a few per cent of divergence for the five data sets),
   except for one data set where less than three sequences per species were
   sampled. We further explore the theoretical limitations of ABGD through
   simulation of explicit speciation and population genetics scenarios. Our
   results emphasize in particular the sensitivity of the method to the
   presence of recent speciation events, via (unrealistically) high rates
   of speciation or large numbers of species. In conclusion, ABGD is fast,
   simple method to split a sequence alignment data set into candidate
   species that should be complemented with other evidence in an
   integrative taxonomic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic environments harbour large and diverse microbial populations
   that ensure their functioning and sustainability. In the current context
   of global change, characterizing microbial diversity has become crucial,
   and new tools have been developed to overcome the methodological
   challenges posed by working with microbes in nature. The advent of
   Sanger sequencing and now next-generation sequencing technologies has
   enabled the resolution of microbial communities to an unprecedented
   degree of precision. However, to correctly interpret microbial diversity
   and its patterns this revolution must also consider conceptual and
   methodological matters. This review presents advances, gaps and caveats
   of these recent approaches when considering microorganisms in aquatic
   ecosystems. We also discuss potentials and limitations of the available
   methodologies, from water sampling to sequence analysis, and suggest
   alternative ways to incorporate results in a conceptual and
   methodological framework. Together, these methods will allow us to gain
   an unprecedented understanding of microbial diversity in aquatic

Abstract = {{We investigated changes in the root-associated fungal communities
   associated with the ectomycorrhizal herb Bistorta vivipara along a
   primary succession gradient using 454 amplicon sequencing. Our main
   objective was to assess the degree of variation in fungal richness and
   community composition as vegetation cover increases along the
   chronosequence. Sixty root systems of B.vivipara were sampled in
   vegetation zones delimited by dated moraines in front of a retreating
   glacier in Norway. We extracted DNA from rinsed root systems, amplified
   the ITS1 region using fungal-specific primers and analysed the amplicons
   using 454 sequencing. Between 437 and 5063 sequences were obtained from
   each root system. Clustering analyses using a 98.5\% sequence similarity
   cut-off yielded a total of 470 operational taxonomic units (OTUs),
   excluding singletons. Between eight and 41 fungal OTUs were detected
   within each root system. Already in the first stage of succession, a
   high fungal diversity was present in the B.vivipara root systems. Total
   number of OTUs increased significantly along the gradient towards climax
   vegetation, but the average number of OTUs per root system stayed
   unchanged. There was a high patchiness in distribution of fungal OTUs
   across root systems, indicating that stochastic processes to a large
   extent structure the fungal communities. However, time since
   deglaciation had impact on the fungal community structure, as a
   systematic shift in the community composition was observed along the
   chronosequence. Ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes were the dominant fungi
   in the roots of B.vivipara, when it comes to both number of OTUs and
   number of sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of information collection generated by metagenomics is
   uncoupled with its meaningful ecological interpretation. New analytical
   approaches based on functional trait-based ecology may help to bridge
   this gap and extend the trait approach to the community level in vast
   and complex environmental genetic data sets. Here, we explored a set of
   community traits that range from nucleotidic to genomic properties in 53
   metagenomic aquatic samples from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS)
   expedition. We found significant differences between the community
   profile derived from the commonly used 16S rRNA gene and from the
   functional trait set. The traits proved to be valuable ecological
   markers by discriminating between marine ecosystems (coastal vs. open
   ocean) and between oceans (Atlantic vs. Indian vs. Pacific). Intertrait
   relationships were also assessed, and we propose some that could be
   further used as habitat descriptors or indicators of artefacts during
   sample processing. Overall, the approach presented here may help to
   interpret metagenomics data to gain a full understanding of microbial
   community patterns in a rigorous ecological framework.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides insights into the morphological and genetic
   diversity in diatoms occurring in core sediments from tropical lakes in
   Kenya. We developed a genetic survey technique specific for diatoms
   utilizing a short region (7667 bp) of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) gene as genetic barcode. Our
   analyses (i) validated the use of rbcL as a barcoding marker for
   diatoms, applied to sediment samples, (ii) showed a significant
   correlation between the results obtained by morphological and molecular
   data and (iii) indicated temporal variation in diatom assemblages on the
   inter- and intra-specific level. Diatom assemblages from a short core
   from Lake Naivasha show a drastic shift over the last 200 years, as
   littoral species (e.g. Navicula) are replaced by more planktonic ones
   (e.g. Aulacoseira). Within that same period, we detected periodic
   changes in the respective frequencies of distinct haplotype groups of
   Navicula, which coincide with wet and dry periods of Lake Naivasha
   between 1820 and 1938 AD. Our genetic analyses on historical lake
   sediments revealed inter- and intra-specific variation in diatoms, which
   is partially hidden behind single morphotypes. The occurrence of
   particular genetic lineages is probably correlated with environmental
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of food webs and their dynamics facilitates understanding
   of the mechanistic processes behind community ecology and ecosystem
   functions. Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and
   components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and
   early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack
   resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more
   accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been
   used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization
   of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized
   DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and
   then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially,
   this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were
   limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent
   development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach
   much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of
   samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the
   potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA
   metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going
   decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases
   make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of
   NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account
   when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both
   technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we
   discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of
   producing quantitative data.}},

Abstract = {{Diet analysis is a prerequisite to fully understand the biology of a
   species and the functioning of ecosystems. For carnivores, traditional
   diet analyses mostly rely upon the morphological identification of
   undigested remains in the faeces. Here, we developed a methodology for
   carnivore diet analyses based on the next-generation sequencing. We
   applied this approach to the analysis of the vertebrate component of
   leopard cat diet in two ecologically distinct regions in northern
   Pakistan. Despite being a relatively common species with a wide
   distribution in Asia, little is known about this elusive predator. We
   analysed a total of 38 leopard cat faeces. After a classical DNA
   extraction, the DNA extracts were amplified using primers for
   vertebrates targeting about 100 bp of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene,
   with and without a blocking oligonucleotide specific to the predator
   sequence. The amplification products were then sequenced on a
   next-generation sequencer. We identified a total of 18 prey taxa,
   including eight mammals, eight birds, one amphibian and one fish. In
   general, our results confirmed that the leopard cat has a very eclectic
   diet and feeds mainly on rodents and particularly on the Muridae family.
   The DNA-based approach we propose here represents a valuable complement
   to current conventional methods. It can be applied to other carnivore
   species with only a slight adjustment relating to the design of the
   blocking oligonucleotide. It is robust and simple to implement and
   allows the possibility of very large-scale analyses.}},

Abstract = {{DNA molecules originating from animals and plants can be retrieved
   directly from sediments and have been used for reconstructing both
   contemporary and past ecosystems. However, the extent to which such dirt
   DNA reflects taxonomic richness and structural diversity remains
   contentious. Here, we couple second generation high-throughput
   sequencing with 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) meta-barcoding, to explore
   the accuracy and sensitivity of dirt DNA as an indicator of vertebrate
   diversity, from soil sampled at safari parks, zoological gardens and
   farms with known species compositions. PCR amplification was successful
   in the full pH range of the investigated soils (6.2 +/- 0.2 to 8.3 +/-
   0.2), but inhibition was detected in extracts from soil of high organic
   content. DNA movement (leaching) through strata was evident in some
   sporadic cases and is influenced by soil texture and structure. We find
   that DNA from the soil surface reflects overall taxonomic richness and
   relative biomass of individual species. However, one species that was
   recently introduced was not detected. Furthermore, animal behaviour was
   shown to influence DNA deposition rates. The approach potentially
   provides a quick methodological alternative to classical ecological
   surveys of biodiversity, and most reliable results are obtained with
   spatial sample replicates, while relative amounts of soil processed per
   site is of less importance.}},

Title = {{Islands in the ice: detecting past vegetation on Greenlandic nunataks

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8, SI}},

Abstract = {{Nunataks are isolated bedrocks protruding through ice sheets. They vary
   in age, but represent island environments in oceans of ice through which
   organism dispersals and replacements can be studied over time. The
   J.A.D. Jensens Nunataks at the southern Greenland ice sheet are the most
   isolated nunataks on the northern hemisphere some 30 km from the nearest
   biological source. They constitute around 2 km2 of ice-free land that
   was established in the early Holocene. We have investigated the changes
   in plant composition at these nunataks using both the results of surveys
   of the flora over the last 130 years and through reconstruction of the
   vegetation from the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (5528 +/- 75 cal
   year BP) using meta-barcoding of plant DNA recovered from the nunatak
   sediments (sedaDNA). Our results show that several of the plant species
   detected with sedaDNA are described from earlier vegetation surveys on
   the nunataks (in 1878, 1967 and 2009). In 1967, a much higher
   biodiversity was detected than from any other of the studied periods.
   While this may be related to differences in sampling efforts for the
   oldest period, it is not the case when comparing the 1967 and 2009
   levels where the botanical survey was exhaustive. As no animals and
   humans are found on the nunataks, this change in diversity over a period
   of just 42 years must relate to environmental changes probably being
   climate-driven. This suggests that even the flora of fairly small and
   isolated ice-free areas reacts quickly to a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Although ancient DNA from sediments (sedaDNA) has been used to
   investigate past ecosystems, the approach has never been directly
   compared with the traditional methods of pollen and macrofossil
   analysis. We conducted a comparative survey of 18 ancient permafrost
   samples spanning the Late Pleistocene (4612.5 thousand years ago), from
   the Taymyr Peninsula in northern Siberia. The results show that pollen,
   macrofossils and sedaDNA are complementary rather than overlapping and,
   in combination, reveal more detailed information on plant
   palaeocommunities than can be achieved by each individual approach.
   SedaDNA and macrofossils share greater overlap in plant identifications
   than with pollen, suggesting that sedaDNA is local in origin. These two
   proxies also permit identification to lower taxonomic levels than
   pollen, enabling investigation into temporal changes in species
   composition and the determination of indicator species to describe
   environmental changes. Combining data from all three proxies reveals an
   area continually dominated by a mosaic vegetation of tundra-steppe,
   pioneer and wet-indicator plants. Such vegetational stability is
   unexpected, given the severe climate changes taking place in the
   Northern Hemisphere during this time, with changes in average annual
   temperatures of >22 degrees C. This may explain the abundance of ice-age
   mammals such as horse and bison in Taymyr Peninsula during the
   Pleistocene and why it acted as a refugium for the last mainland woolly
   mammoth. Our finding reveals the benefits of combining sedaDNA, pollen
   and macrofossil for palaeovegetational reconstruction and adds to the
   increasing evidence suggesting large areas of the Northern Hemisphere
   remained ecologically stable during the Late Pleistocene.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in plant species richness has been described using only
   aboveground vegetation. The species richness of roots and rhizomes has
   never been compared with aboveground richness in natural plant
   communities. We made direct comparisons of grassland plant richness in
   identical volumes (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 m) above and below the soil surface,
   using conventional species identification to measure aboveground
   richness and 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron to
   measure belowground richness. We described above- and belowground
   richness at multiple spatial scales (from a neighbourhood scale of
   centimetres to a community scale of hundreds of metres), and related
   variation in richness to soil fertility. Tests using reference material
   indicated that 454 sequencing captured patterns of species composition
   and abundance with acceptable accuracy. At neighbourhood scales,
   belowground richness was up to two times greater than aboveground
   richness. The relationship between above- and belowground richness was
   significantly different from linear: beyond a certain level of
   belowground richness, aboveground richness did not increase further.
   Belowground richness also exceeded that of aboveground at the community
   scale, indicating that some species are temporarily dormant and absent
   aboveground. Similar to other grassland studies, aboveground richness
   declined with increasing soil fertility; in contrast, the number of
   species found only belowground increased significantly with fertility.
   These results indicate that conventional aboveground studies of plant
   richness may overlook many coexisting species, and that belowground
   richness becomes relatively more important in conditions where
   aboveground richness decreases. Measuring plant belowground richness can
   considerably alter perceptions of biodiversity and its responses to
   natural and anthropogenic factors.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms are known for their important role within the functioning of
   an ecosystem, and their diversity can be used as an indicator of
   ecosystem health. To date, earthworm diversity has been investigated
   through conventional extraction methods such as handsorting, soil
   washing or the application of a mustard solution. Such techniques are
   time consuming and often difficult to apply. We showed that combining
   DNA metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing facilitates the
   identification of earthworm species from soil samples. The first step of
   our experiments was to create a reference database of mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) 16S gene for 14 earthworm species found in the French Alps.
   Using this database, we designed two new primer pairs targeting very
   short and informative DNA sequences (about 30 and 70 bp) that allow
   unambiguous species identification. Finally, we analysed extracellular
   DNA taken from soil samples in two localities (two plots per locality
   and eight samples per plot). The two short metabarcode regions led to
   the identification of a total of eight earthworm species. The earthworm
   communities identified by the DNA-based approach appeared to be well
   differentiated between the two localities and are consistent with
   results derived from inventories collected using the handsorting method.
   The possibility of assessing earthworm communities from hundreds or even
   thousands of localities through the use of extracellular soil DNA will
   undoubtedly stimulate further ecological research on these organisms.
   Using the same DNA extracts, our study also illustrates the potential of
   environmental DNA as a tool to assess the diversity of other
   soil-dwelling animal taxa.}},

   process, focused on restricted groups of organisms. We envision a new
   paradigm in ecosystem assessment, which we refer to as Biomonitoring

   with high-throughput DNA sequencing on next-generation sequencing
   platforms. We discuss the transformational nature of DNA-based

Abstract = {{Virtually all empirical ecological studies require species
   identification during data collection. DNA metabarcoding refers to the
   automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample
   containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample
   containing degraded DNA (soil, water, faeces, etc.). It can be
   implemented for both modern and ancient environmental samples. The
   availability of next-generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists
   need for high-throughput taxon identification have facilitated the
   emergence of DNA metabarcoding. The potential power of DNA metabarcoding
   as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on PCR
   and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive
   taxonomic reference libraries. Further developments associated with the
   impressive progress in DNA sequencing will eliminate the currently
   required DNA amplification step, and comprehensive taxonomic reference
   libraries composed of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribosomal
   nuclear DNA can be built based on the well-curated DNA extract
   collections maintained by standardized barcoding initiatives. The
   near-term future of DNA metabarcoding has an enormous potential to boost
   data acquisition in biodiversity research.}},

Abstract = {{Few species worldwide have attracted as much attention in relation to
   conservation and sustainable management as Pacific salmon. Most
   populations have suffered significant reductions, many have disappeared,
   and even entire evolutionary significant units (ESUs) are believed to
   have been lost. Until now, no smoking gun in terms of direct genetic
   evidence of the loss of a salmon ESU has been produced. In this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Iwamoto (2012) use microsatellite analysis of
   historical scale samples of Columbia River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
   nerka) from 1924 (Fig.1) to ask the pertinent question: Do the
   historical samples contain salmon from extirpated populations or ESUs?
   They identified four genetic groups in the historical samples of which
   two were almost genetically identical to contemporary ESUs in the river,
   one showed genetic relationship with a third ESU, but one group was not
   related to any of the contemporary populations. In association with
   ecological data, the genetic results suggest that an early migrating
   Columbia River headwater sockeye salmon ESU has been extirpated. The
   study has significant importance for conservation and reestablishment of
   sockeye populations in the Columbia River, but also underpins the
   general significance of shifting baselines in conservation biology, and
   how to assess loss of genetic biodiversity. The results clearly
   illustrate the huge and versatile potential of using historical DNA in
   population and conservation genetics. Because of the extraordinarily
   plentiful historical samples and rapid advances in fish genomics, fishes
   are likely to spearhead future studies of temporal ecological and
   population genomics in non-model organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Admixture and introgression have varied effects on population viability
   and fitness. Admixture might be an important source of new alleles,
   particularly for small, geographically isolated populations. However,
   admixture might also cause outbreeding depression if populations are
   adapted to different ecological or climatic conditions. Because of the
   emerging use of translocation and admixture as a conservation and
   wildlife management strategy to reduce genetic load (termed genetic
   rescue), the possible effects of admixture have practical consequences
   (Bouzat 2009; Hedrick \& Fredrickson 2010). Importantly, genetic load
   and local adaptation are properties of individual loci and epistatic
   interactions among loci rather than properties of genomes. Likewise, the
   outcome and consequences of genetic rescue depend on the fitness effects
   of individual introduced alleles. In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   Miller (2012) use model-based, population genomic analyses to document
   locus-specific effects of a recent genetic rescue in the bighorn sheep
   population within the National Bison Range wildlife refuge (NBR;
   Montana, USA). They find a subset of introduced alleles associated with
   increased fitness in NBR bighorn sheep, some of which experienced
   accelerated introgression following their introduction. These loci mark
   regions of the genome that could constitute the genetic basis of the

Abstract = {{In ecology, there is an increasing amount of research dedicated to
   understanding how intraspecific genetic diversity can extend beyond the
   population level to influence the assembly of communities and the
   functioning of ecosystems. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Koh
   (2012) take this exploration to a new level using bacterial biofilms and
   protozoan grazers. They show that there is heritable variation in the
   phenotypes of different variants of biofilms of Serratia marcescens and
   that these strains display complementarity when combined in a diverse
   assemblage. Mixtures of variants were significantly more resistant to
   protozoan grazing than either wild-type or variant biofilms grown in
   monocultures. While similar biodiversity effects of genotype mixtures
   have been observed in other systems, Koh (2012) link phenotype variation
   of the biofilms to a single nucleotide polymorphism in one regulatory
   gene. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that minimal changes in a
   genotype can result in substantial shifts in interspecific ecological
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Most adaptive traits are controlled by large number of genes that may
   all together be the targets of selection. Adaptation may thus involve
   multiple but not necessarily substantial allele frequency changes. This
   has important consequences for the detection of selected loci and
   implies that a quantitative genetics framework may be more appropriate
   than the classical selective sweep paradigm. Preferred methods to detect
   loci involved in local adaptation are based on the detection of outlier
   values of the allelic differentiation FST. A quantitative genetics
   framework is adopted here to review theoretical expectations for how
   allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (FSTQ) relates to
   (i), neutral genetic differentiation (FST) and (ii), phenotypic
   differentiation (QST). We identify cases where results of outlier-based
   methods are likely to be poor and where differentiation at selected loci
   conveys little information regarding local adaptation. A first case is
   when neutral differentiation is high, so that local adaptation does not
   necessitate increased differentiation. A second case is when local
   adaptation is reached via an increased covariance of allelic effects
   rather than via allele frequency changes, which is more likely under
   high gene flow when the number of loci is high and selection is recent.
   The comparison of theoretical predictions with observed data from the
   literature suggests that polygenic local adaptation involving only faint
   allele frequency changes are very likely in some species such as forest
   trees and for climate-related traits. Recent methodological improvements
   that may alleviate the weakness of FST-based detection methods are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Archival scales from 603 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), sampled
   from May to July 1924 in the lower Columbia River, were analysed for
   genetic variability at 12 microsatellite loci and compared to 17
   present-day O.nerka populationsexhibiting either anadromous (sockeye
   salmon) or nonanadromous (kokanee) life historiesfrom throughout the
   Columbia River Basin, including areas upstream of impassable dams built
   subsequent to 1924. Statistical analyses identified four major genetic
   assemblages of sockeye salmon in the 1924 samples. Two of these putative
   historical groupings were found to be genetically similar to extant
   evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) in the Okanogan and Wenatchee
   Rivers (pairwise FST = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively), and assignment
   tests were able to allocate 77\% of the fish in these two historical
   groupings to the contemporary Okanogan River and Lake Wenatchee ESUs. A
   third historical genetic grouping was most closely aligned with
   contemporary sockeye salmon in Redfish Lake, Idaho, although the
   association was less robust (pairwise FST = 0.060). However, a fourth
   genetic grouping did not appear to be related to any contemporary
   sockeye salmon or kokanee population, assigned poorly to the O.nerka
   baseline, and had distinctive early return migration timing, suggesting
   that this group represents a historical ESU originating in headwater
   lakes in British Columbia that was probably extirpated sometime after
   1924. The lack of a contemporary O.nerka population possessing the
   genetic legacy of this extinct ESU indicates that efforts to reestablish
   early-migrating sockeye salmon to the headwater lakes region of the
   Columbia River will be difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic rescue is a management intervention whereby a small population
   is supplemented with individuals from other populations in an attempt to
   reverse the effects of inbreeding and increased genetic load. One such
   rescue was recently documented in the population of bighorn sheep (Ovis
   canadensis) within the National Bison Range wildlife refuge (Montana,
   USA). Here, we examine the locus-specific effects of rescue in this
   population using a newly developed genome-wide set of 195 microsatellite
   loci and first-generation linkage map. We found that the rate of
   introgression varied among loci and that 111 loci, 57\% of those
   examined, deviated from patterns of neutral inheritance. The most common
   deviation was an excess of homozygous genotypes relative to neutral
   expectations, indicative of directional selection. As in previous study
   of this rescue, individuals with more introduced alleles had higher
   reproductive success and longevity. In addition, we found 30 loci,
   distributed throughout the genome, which seem to have individual effects
   on these life history traits. Although the potential for outbreeding
   depression is a major concern when translocating individuals between
   populations, we found no evidence of such effects in this population.}},

Abstract = {{The human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is globally widespread,
   causing high malaria morbidity. As P.vivax is highly endemic to India,
   and previous reports indicate genetic homogeneity in population samples,
   we tested the hypothesis of no genetic structuring in Indian P.vivax.
   Further, based on the reports of increasing incidence of Plasmodium
   falciparum infection in comparison with P.vivax in recent years in
   India, it was important to understand whether reduction in population
   size has resulted in decrease in P.vivax infection rate in India. For
   this, we utilized recently developed putatively neutral markers from
   chromosome 13 of P.vivax to score single nucleotide polymorphisms in 126
   P.vivax isolates collected from 10 different places in India. The
   overall results indicated that Indian P.vivax bears high nucleotide
   diversity within population samples but moderate amount of genetic
   differentiation between population samples. STRUCTURE analysis grouped
   10 population samples into three clusters based on the proportion of the
   genetic ancestries in each population. However, the pattern of
   clustering does not correlate with sampling locations in India.
   Furthermore, analyses of past demographic events indicated reduction in
   population size in majority of population samples, but when isolates
   from all the 10 samples were considered as a single population, the data
   fit to the demographic equilibrium model. All these observations clearly
   indicate that Indian P.vivax presents complex evolutionary history but
   possesses several features of being a part of ancestral distribution
   range of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of once contiguous natural
   landscapes into a patchy habitat interspersed within a growing urban
   matrix. Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced
   movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human
   development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and
   pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large
   home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive
   to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and
   their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus
   (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We
   predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit
   bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen
   populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV
   isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our
   findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat
   patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations
   separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the
   distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through
   phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less
   spatially structuredexhibiting a more even distribution between habitat
   fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient
   for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude
   structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population
   is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration
   resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple
   molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow
   between subpopulations when assessing connectivity.}},

   evolution of immune genes in natural populations have focused almost
   exclusively on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). However, the
   MHC represents only a fraction of the immune system and there is a need
   to broaden research in wild species to include other immune genes. Here,
   we examine the evidence for natural selection in a range of non-MHC
   genes in a natural population of field voles (Microtus agrestis). We
   concentrate primarily on genes encoding cytokines, signalling molecules
   critical in eliciting and mediating immune responses and identify
   signatures of natural selection acting on several of these genes. In
   particular, genetic diversity within Interleukin 1 beta and Interleukin
   2 appears to have been maintained through balancing selection. Taken
   together with previous findings that polymorphism within these genes is
   associated with variation in resistance to multiple pathogens, this
   suggests that pathogen-mediated selection may be an important force
   driving genetic diversity at cytokine loci in voles and other natural
   populations. These results also suggest that, along with the MHC,
   preservation of genetic variation within cytokine genes should be a
   priority for the conservation genetics of threatened wildlife
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Refugial populations at the rear edge are predicted to contain higher
   genetic diversity than those resulting from expansion, such as in
   post-glacial recolonizations. However, peripheral populations are also
   predicted to have decreased diversity compared to the centre of a
   species distribution. We aim to test these predictions by comparing
   genetic diversity in populations at the limits of distribution of the
   seagrass Zostera marina, with populations in the species previously
   described central diversity hotspot. Zostera marina populations show
   decreased allelic richness, heterozygosity and genotypic richness in
   both the rear edge and the leading edge compared to the diversity
   hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. However, when populations are
   pooled, genetic diversity at the southern range is as high as in the
   North Sea/Baltic region while the leading edge remains low in genetic
   diversity. The decreased genetic diversity in these southern Iberian
   populations compared to more central populations is possibly the effect
   of drift because of small effective population size, as a result of
   reduced habitat, low sexual reproduction and low gene flow. However,
   when considering the whole southern edge of distribution rather than per
   population, diversity is as high as in the central hotspot in the North
   Sea/Baltic region. We conclude that diversity patterns assessed per
   population can mask the real regional richness that is typical of rear
   edge populations, which have played a key role in the species
   biogeographical history and as marginal diversity hotspots have very
   high conservation value.}},

Abstract = {{AFLP-based genome scans are widely used to study the genetics of
   adaptation and to identify genomic regions potentially under selection.
   However, this approach usually fails to detect the actual genes or
   mutations targeted by selection owing to the difficulties of obtaining
   DNA sequences from AFLP fragments. Here, we combine classical AFLP
   outlier detection with 454 sequencing of AFLP fragments to obtain
   sequences from outlier loci. We applied this approach to the study of
   resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) toxins in the
   dengue vector Aedes aegypti. A genome scan of Bti-resistant and
   Bti-susceptible A.aegypti laboratory strains was performed based on 432
   AFLP markers. Fourteen outliers were detected using two different
   population genetic algorithms. Out of these, 11 were successfully
   sequenced. Three contained transposable elements (TEs) sequences, and
   the 10 outliers that could be mapped at a unique location in the
   reference genome were located on different supercontigs. One outlier was
   in the vicinity of a gene coding for an aminopeptidase potentially
   involved in Bti toxin-binding. Patterns of sequence variability of this
   gene showed significant deviation from neutrality in the resistant
   strain but not in the susceptible strain, even after taking into account
   the known demographic history of the selected strain. This gene is a
   promising candidate for future functional analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic oscillations during the last few million years had
   well-documented effects on the distributions and genomes of temperate
   plants and animals, but much less is known of their impacts on tropical
   and subtropical species. In contrast to Europe and North America,
   ice-sheets did not cover most of China during glacial periods, and the
   effects of glacial cycles were less dramatic. Fig trees are a
   predominantly tropical group pollinated by host-specific fig wasps. We
   employed partial mitochondrial COI (918 bp) and nuclear ITS2 (462 bp)
   gene sequences to investigate the genetic structure and demographic
   histories of the wasps that pollinate the subtropical Ficus pumila var.
   pumila in Southeastern China. Deep genetic divergence in both
   mitochondrial (7.211.6\%) and nuclear genes (1.62.9\%) indicates that
   three pollinator species are present and that they diverged about 4.72
   and 6.00 Myr bp. This predates the Quaternary ice ages, but corresponds
   with the formation of the Taiwan Strait and uplifting of the WuyiXianxia
   Mountains. The three pollinators have largely allopatric distribution
   patterns in China and display different postglacial demographic
   histories. Wiebesia spp. 1 and 2 occupy, respectively, the northern and
   southern regions of the mainland host range. Their populations both
   underwent significant postglacial spatial expansions, but at different
   times and at different rates. Wiebesia sp. 3 is largely restricted to
   northern islands and shows less evidence of recent population expansion.
   Their mainly allopatric distributions and different demographic
   histories are consistent with host plant postglacial expansion from
   three distinct refugia and suggest one mechanism whereby fig trees gain
   multiple pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the biogeography and the phylogeography of the endemic
   Macaronesian red Festuca species (Loliinae, Poaceae) is of prime
   interest in understanding the speciation and colonization patterns of
   recently evolved groups in oceanic archipelagos. Coalescence-based
   analyses of plastid trnLF sequences were employed to estimate
   evolutionary parameters and to test different species-history scenarios
   that model the pattern of species divergence. Bayesian IM estimates of
   species divergence times suggested that ancestral lineages of diploid
   Macaronesian and Iberian red fescues could have diverged between 1.2 and
   1.57 Ma. When empirical data were compared to coalescence-based
   simulated distributions of discordance and p-distance statistics, two
   species-history models were chosen in which the first branching lineage
   derived in Canarian Festuca agustinii. Its sister lineage could have
   involved a recent polytomy leading to the Madeiran Festuca jubata, the
   Azorean Festuca francoi + Festuca petraea and the continental Festuca
   rivularis lineages (Canarian model) or the sequential branching of
   lineages leading to F. jubata and finally to the sister clades of
   F.rivularis and F.francoi + F.petraea (Sequential model). Nested clade
   phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) and a first adapted hostparasite
   co-evolutionary ParaFit method were used to detect the phylogeographic
   signal. NCPA inferred long-distance colonizations for the entire diploid
   red Festuca complex, but allopatric-fragmentation and
   isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns were inferred within archipelagos.
   In addition, the ParaFit method suggested a generalized pattern of a
   stepping-stone model at all hierarchical levels.
   Maximum-likelihood-based dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) models
   were superimposed on the Sequential model species tree. The
   three-independent-colonization (3IC) model was the best supported
   biogeographic scenario, concurring with previous analysis based on
   multilocus AFLP data.}},

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal is an important life history trait driving variation in
   individual fitness, and therefore, a proper understanding of the factors
   underlying dispersal behaviour is critical to many fields including
   population dynamics, behavioural ecology and conservation biology.
   However, individual dispersal patterns remain difficult to quantify
   despite many years of research using direct and indirect methods. Here,
   we quantify dispersal in a single intensively studied population of the
   cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps)
   using genetic networks created from the combination of pairwise
   relatedness data and social networking methods and compare this to
   dispersal estimates from re-sighting data. This novel approach not only
   identifies movements between social groups within our study sites but
   also provides an estimation of immigration rates of individuals
   originating outside the study site. Both genetic and re-sighting data
   indicated that dispersal was strongly female biased, but the magnitude
   of dispersal estimates was much greater using genetic data. This
   suggests that many previous studies relying on markrecapture data may
   have significantly underestimated dispersal. An analysis of spatial
   genetic structure within the sampled population also supports the idea
   that females are more dispersive, with females having no structure
   beyond the bounds of their own social group, while male genetic
   structure expands for 750 m from their social group. Although the
   genetic network approach we have used is an excellent tool for
   visualizing the social and genetic microstructure of social animals and
   identifying dispersers, our results also indicate the importance of
   applying them in parallel with behavioural and life history data.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of species diversity to emergent, ecological properties
   of communities is increasingly appreciated, but the importance of
   within-species genetic diversity for analogous emergent properties of
   populations is only just becoming apparent. Here, the properties and
   effects of genetic variation on predation resistance in populations were
   assessed and the molecular mechanism underlying these emergent effects
   was investigated. Using biofilms of the ubiquitous bacterium Serratia
   marcescens, we tested the importance of genetic diversity in defending
   biofilms against protozoan grazing, a main source of mortality for
   bacteria in all natural ecosystems. S.marcescens biofilms established
   from wild-type cells produce heritable, stable variants, which when
   experimentally combined, persist as a diverse assemblage and are
   significantly more resistant to grazing than either wild type or variant
   biofilms grown in monoculture. This diversity effect is
   biofilm-specific, a result of either facilitation or resource
   partitioning among variants, with equivalent experiments using
   planktonic cultures and grazers resulting in dominance by a single
   resistant strain. The variants studied are all the result of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms in one regulatory gene suggesting that the
   benefits of genetic diversity in clonal biofilms can occur through
   remarkably minimal genetic change. The findings presented here provide a
   new insight on the integration of genetics and population ecology, in
   which diversity arising through minimal changes in genotype can have
   major ecological implications for natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{As honey bee populations decline, interest in pathogenic and mutualistic
   relationships between bees and microorganisms has increased. Honey bees
   and bumble bees appear to have a simple intestinal bacterial fauna that
   includes acidophilic bacteria. Here, we explore the hypothesis that
   sweat bees can acquire acidophilic bacteria from the environment. To
   quantify bacterial communities associated with two species of North
   American and one species of Neotropical sweat bees, we conducted 16S
   rDNA amplicon 454 pyrosequencing of bacteria associated with the bees,
   their brood cells and their nests. Lactobacillus spp. were the most
   abundant bacteria in many, but not all, of the samples. To determine
   whether bee-associated lactobacilli can also be found in the
   environment, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the
   genus Lactobacillus. Previously described groups that associate with
   Bombus and Apis appeared relatively specific to these genera. Close
   relatives of several bacteria that have been isolated from flowers,
   however, were isolated from bees. Additionally, all three sweat bee
   species associated with lactobacilli related to flower-associated
   lactobacilli. These data suggest that there may be at least two
   different means by which bees acquire putative probiotics. Some
   lactobacilli appear specific to corbiculate apids, possibly because they
   are largely maternally inherited (vertically transmitted). Other
   lactobacilli, however, may be regularly acquired from environmental
   sources such as flowers. Sweat beeassociated lactobacilli were found to
   be abundant in the pollen and frass inside the nests of halictids,
   suggesting that they could play a role in suppressing the growth of
   moulds and other spoilage organisms.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1769-1778}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bradyrhizobium strains sampled from 14 legume genera native to eastern
   North America showed substantial host-related phylogenetic clustering at
   three loci in the symbiotic island (SI) region (nodC, nifD, nifH),
   indicating selection of distinct suites of SI lineages by different
   legumes. Bacteria assorted consistently with particular legumes across
   two regions separated by 800 km, implying recurrent assembly of the same
   symbiotic combinations. High genetic polymorphism of all three SI loci
   relative to four nonsymbiotic loci supported the inference that a form
   of multiple-niche balancing selection has acted on the SI region,
   arising from differential symbiont utilization by different legume taxa.
   Extensive discordance between the tree for SI variants and a
   phylogenetic tree inferred for four housekeeping loci implied that
   lateral transfer of the symbiosis island region has been common (at
   least 26 transfer events among 85 Bradyrhizobium strains analysed).
   Patterns of linkage disequilibrium also supported the conclusion that
   recombination has impacted symbiotic and nonsymbiotic regions unequally.
   The high prevalence of lateral transfer suggests that acquisition of a
   novel SI variant may often confer a strong selective advantage for
   recipient cells.}},

Abstract = {{Diet strongly influences the intestinal microbial communities through
   species sorting. Alternatively, these communicates may differ because of
   chance variation in local microbial exposures or species losses among
   allopatric host populations (i.e. ecological drift). We investigated how
   these forces shape enteric communities of Galapagos marine and land
   iguanas. Geographically proximate populations shared more similar
   communities within a host ecotype, suggesting a role for ecological
   drift during host colonization of the islands. Additionally, evidence of
   taxa sharing between proximate heterospecific host populations suggests
   that contemporary local exposures also influence the gut community
   assembly. While selective forces such as host-bacterial interactions or
   dietary differences are dominant drivers of intestinal community
   differences among hosts, historical and contemporary processes of
   ecological drift may lead to differences in bacterial composition within
   a host species. Whether such differences in community structure
   translate into geographic variation in benefits derived from these
   intimate microbial communities remains to be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the eukaryotes, sexual reproduction is an almost universal
   phenomenon. However, within the Kingdom Fungi, this relationship is not
   so clear-cut. Fungi exhibit a spectrum of reproductive modes and
   life-cycles; amongst the better known species, sexual reproduction is
   often facultative, can be rare, and in over half of the known Ascomycota
   (the moulds) is unknown (Taylor 1999). However, over the last decade, it
   has become apparent that many of these asexual mitosporic taxa undergo
   cryptic recombination via unobserved mechanisms and that wholly asexual
   fungi are, in fact, a rarity (Taylor 1999, 2001; Heitman 2010). This
   revolution in our understanding of fungal sexuality has come about in
   two ways: Firstly, sexual reproduction leaves an imprint on fungal
   genomes by maintaining genes required for mating and by generating
   patterns of mutation and recombination restricted to meiotic processes.
   Secondly, scientists have become better at catching fungi in flagrante
   delicto. The genus Aspergillus is one such fungus where a combination of
   population genetics, genomics and taxonomy has been able to intuit the
   existence of sex, then to catch the fungus in the act and formally
   describe their sexual stages. So, why are sexy moulds exciting? One
   species in particular, Aspergillus flavus, is notorious for its ability
   to produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, of which the
   polyketide aflatoxins (AF) are carcinogenic and others (such as
   cyclopiazonic acid) are toxigenic. Because of the predilection of
   A.similar to flavus to grow on crops, such as peanuts, corn and cotton,
   biocontrol is widely used to mitigate infection by pre-applying
   nonaflatoxigenic (AF-) strains to competitively exclude the wild-type
   AF+ strains. However, the eventual fate in nature of these biocontrol
   strains is not known. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Olarte (2012)
   make an important contribution by using laboratory crosses of A.similar
   to flavus to show that not only is AF highly heritable, but AF- strains
   can become AF+ via crossing over during meiosis. This observation has
   raised the spectre of cross-breeding and non-mendelian inheritance of AF
   between native and biocontrol strains of the fungus, leading to an
   increase in the natural diversity of the fungus with perhaps
   unanticipated consequences.}},

Abstract = {{A main focus within biomedical research is to understand how adverse
   environmental conditions experienced during early development affects
   lifelong health (Barker 1992). Within this context, extensive research
   in rodent models and humans has shown that intrauterine growth
   retardation (IUGR) caused by nutrient restriction during early
   development is often followed by post-natal catch-up growth when access
   to food resources improves. However, this accelerated growth rate seems
   to come at a cost, as metabolic and endocrine processes that are
   programmed during this time cause later-life onset of diseases such as
   obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in
   Crespi \& Denver 2005). In this issue Molecular Ecology, Geiger (2012)
   asked what are the costs of catch-up growth in nutrient-restricted king
   penguin chicks (Fig.similar to 1) by measuring lengths of telomeres, the
   protective DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes, before and after
   catch-up growth, as the amount and rate of telomere sequence loss over
   time has been associated with reduced lifespan in both model and
   nonmodel organisms (see reviews of Costantini 2010; Haussmann \&
   Marchetto 2010). Geiger (2011) found that chicks entering the
   post-winter growth season at a smaller size exhibited increased growth
   rates (i.e. catch-up growth) at the cost of increased oxidative stress
   and reduced telomere lengths compared with the chicks entering the
   growth period at a larger size. Furthermore, chicks that did not survive
   had drastically shorter telomere lengths and reduced antioxidant
   capacities at the beginning of the growth period than all other chicks,
   thereby directly associating telomere length to mortality. These results
   suggest that while catch-up growth allows smaller chicks to head off
   into the world on equal footing with chicks that hatched at a larger
   size, it likely comes at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Thus, this
   study provides a mechanism that supports the antagonistic pleiotropy
   theory of senescence (Promislow 2004).}},

   distinguishing between phenotypic and molecular genetics approaches.
   After describing monitoring designs, we develop explicit criteria for
   demonstrating adaptive responses, which include testing for selection
   and establishing clear links between genetic and environmental change.
   We then review a few exemplary studies that explore adaptive responses
   to climate change in Drosophila, selective responses to hunting and
   fishing, and contemporary evolution in Daphnia using resurrected resting
   eggs. We further review a broader set of 44 studies to assess how well
   they meet the proposed criteria, and conclude that only 23\% fulfill all
   criteria. Approximately half (43\%) of these studies failed to rule out
   the alternative hypothesis of replacement by a different, better-adapted
   population. Likewise, 34\% of the studies based on phenotypic variation
   did not test for selection as opposed to drift. These shortcomings can
   be addressed via improved experimental designs and statistical testing.
   We foresee monitoring of adaptive responses as a future valuable tool in
   conservation biology, for identifying populations unable to evolve at
   sufficiently high rates and for identifying possible donor populations
   for genetic rescue. Technological advances will further augment the
   realization of this potential, especially next-generation sequencing
   technologies that allow for monitoring at the level of whole genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction may be cryptic or facultative in fungi and therefore
   difficult to detect. Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes blast, the most
   damaging fungal disease of rice, is thought to originate from southeast
   Asia. It reproduces asexually in all rice-growing regions. Sexual
   reproduction has been suspected in limited areas of southeast Asia, but
   has never been demonstrated in contemporary populations. We
   characterized several M. oryzae populations worldwide both biologically
   and genetically, to identify candidate populations for sexual
   reproduction. The sexual cycle of M. oryzae requires two strains of
   opposite mating types, at least one of which is female-fertile, to come
   into contact. In one Chinese population, the two mating types were found
   to be present at similar frequencies and almost all strains were
   female-fertile. Compatible strains from this population completed the
   sexual cycle in vitro and produced viable progenies. Genotypic richness
   and linkage disequilibrium data also supported the existence of sexual
   reproduction in this population. We resampled this population the
   following year, and the data obtained confirmed the presence of all the
   biological and genetic characteristics of sexual reproduction. In
   particular, a considerable genetic reshuffling of alleles was observed
   between the 2 years. Computer simulations confirmed that the observed
   genetic characteristics were unlikely to have arisen in the absence of
   recombination. We therefore concluded that a contemporary population of
   M. oryzae, pathogenic on rice, reproduces sexually in natura in
   southeast Asia. Our findings provide evidence for the loss of sexual
   reproduction by a fungal plant pathogen outside its centre of origin.}},

Title = {{Influence of finite-sites mutation, population subdivision and sampling

Abstract = {{Molecular hyperdiversity has been documented in viruses, prokaryotes and
   eukaryotes. Such organisms undermine the assumptions of the
   infinite-sites mutational model, because multiple mutational events at a
   site comprise a non-negligible portion of polymorphisms. Moreover,
   different sampling schemes of individuals from species with subdivided
   populations can profoundly influence resulting patterns and
   interpretations of molecular variation. Inspired by molecular
   hyperdiversity in the nematode Caenorhabditis sp. 5, which exhibits
   average pairwise differences among synonymous sites of >5\% as well as
   modest population structure, we investigated via coalescent simulation
   the joint effects of a finite-sites mutation (FSM) process and
   population subdivision on the variant frequency spectrum. From many
   demes interconnected through a stepping-stone migration model, we
   constructed local samples from a single deme, pooled samples from
   several demes and scattered samples of a single individual from numerous
   demes. Compared with a single panmictic population at equilibrium, we
   find that high population mutation rates induce a deficit of rare
   variants (positive Tajimas D) under a FSM model. Population structure
   also induces such a skew for local samples when migration is high and
   for pooled samples when migration is low. Contrasts of sampling schemes
   for C. sp. 5 imply high mutational input coupled with high migration. We
   propose that joint analysis of local, pooled and scattered samples for
   species with subdivided populations provides a means of improving
   inference of demographic history, by virtue of the partially distinct
   patterns of polymorphism that manifest when sequences are analyzed
   according to differing sampling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene
   flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in
   New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly
   fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively
   nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide
   dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban
   landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban
   environment and compare the success of two different landscape
   connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was
   associated with effective distances between populations that were
   calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different
   approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates
   the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance
   (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR),
   an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance
   paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly
   associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and
   Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance
   using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between
   city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces
   that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway
   medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts
   of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban
   reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Deciphering patterns of genetic variation within a species is essential
   for understanding population structure, local adaptation and differences
   in diversity between populations. Whilst neutrally evolving genetic
   markers can be used to elucidate demographic processes and genetic
   structure, they are not subject to selection and therefore are not
   informative about patterns of adaptive variation. As such, assessments
   of pertinent adaptive loci, such as the immunity genes of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC), are increasingly being incorporated
   into genetic studies. In this study, we combined neutral
   (microsatellite, mtDNA) and adaptive (MHC class II DLA-DRB1 locus)
   markers to elucidate the factors influencing patterns of genetic
   variation in the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus); an endangered canid
   that has suffered extensive declines in distribution and abundance. Our
   genetic analyses found all extant wild dog populations to be relatively
   small (Ne < 30). Furthermore, through coalescent modelling, we detected
   a genetic signature of a recent and substantial demographic decline,
   which correlates with human expansion, but contrasts with findings in
   some other African mammals. We found strong structuring of wild dog
   populations, indicating the negative influence of extensive habitat
   fragmentation and loss of gene flow between habitat patches. Across
   populations, we found that the spatial and temporal structure of
   microsatellite diversity and MHC diversity were correlated and strongly
   influenced by demographic stability and population size, indicating the
   effects of genetic drift in these small populations. Despite this
   correlation, we detected signatures of selection at the MHC, implying
   that selection has not been completely overwhelmed by genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{The metapopulation concept is a cornerstone in the recent history of
   ecology and evolution. However, determining whether a natural system
   fits a metapopulation model is a complex issue. Extinction-colonization
   dynamics are indeed often difficult to quantify because species
   detectability is not always 100\%, resulting in an imperfect record of
   extinctions. Here, we explore whether combining population genetics with
   demographic and ecological surveys can yield more realistic estimates of
   metapopulation dynamics. We apply this approach to the freshwater snail
   Drepanotrema depressissimum in a fragmented landscape of tropical ponds.
   In addition to studying correlations between genetic diversity and
   demographical or ecological characteristics, we undertake, for the first
   time, a detailed search for genetic signatures of
   extinctionrecolonization events using temporal changes in allele
   frequencies within sites. Surprisingly, genetic data indicate that
   extinction is much rarer than suggested by demographic surveys.
   Consequently, this system is better described as a set of populations
   with different sizes and immigration rates than as a true
   metapopulation. We identify several cases of apparent extinction owing
   to nondetection of low-density populations, and of aestivating
   individuals in desiccated ponds. More generally, we observed a frequent
   mismatch between genetic and demographical/ecological information at
   small spatial and temporal scales. We discuss the causes of these
   discrepancies and show how these two types of data provide complementary
   information on population dynamics and history, especially when temporal
   genetic samples are available.}},

Abstract = {{Whether speciation can advance to completion in the face of initially
   high levels of gene flow is a very controversial topic in evolutionary
   biology. Extensive gene exchange is generally considered to homogenize
   populations and counteract divergence. Moreover, the role of
   introgressive hybridization in evolution remains largely unexplored in
   animals, particularly in freshwater zooplankton in which allopatric
   speciation is considered to be the norm. Our work investigates the
   genetic structure of two young ecological species: the pond species,
   Daphnia pulex and the lake species, Daphnia pulicaria. Phylogenetic and
   population genetics analyses were conducted on mitochondrial NADH
   dehydrogenase 5 (ND5) gene, the nuclear Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) gene
   and 21 nuclear microsatellite markers in 416 individuals from habitats
   with various degrees of permanence. The strong and consistent
   phylogenetic discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial markers
   suggests a complex evolutionary history of multiple independent habitat
   transition events that involved hybridization and introgression between
   lake and pond Daphnia. On the other hand, the low level of contemporary
   gene flow between adjacent populations indicates the presence of
   effective habitat isolating barriers. The Daphnia system provides strong
   evidence for a divergence-with-gene flow speciation model that involves
   multiple habitat transition events.}},

Abstract = {{The perennial herb Meconopsis cambrica, a western European endemic, is
   the only European species of the otherwise Himalayan genus Meconopsis
   and has been interpreted as a Tertiary relict species. Using rbcL and
   ITS sequence variation, we date the split between M.similar to cambrica
   and its sister clade Papaver s.str. to the Middle to Upper Miocene (12.8
   Myr, 6.419.2 Myr HPD). Within M.similar to cambrica, cpDNA sequence
   variation reveals the existence of two groups of populations with a
   comparable level of genetic variation: a northern group from Great
   Britain, the Massif Central, the western Pyrenees and the Iberian
   System, and a southern group from the central and eastern Pyrenees.
   Populations from the Cantabrian Mountains were placed in both groups.
   Based on ITS sequence variation, the divergence between these two groups
   can be dated to 1.5 Myr (0.42.8 Myr HPD), and the age of the British
   populations is estimated as 0.37 Myr (0.00.9 Myr HPD). Amplified
   fragment length polymorphism results confirm the distinctive nature of
   the populations from Britain, the Massif Central and the central and
   eastern Pyrenees. These patterns of latitudinal variation of M.similar
   to cambrica differ from patterns of longitudinal differentiation found
   in many other temperate species and imply glacial survival of the
   northern populations in northerly refugia. The primary differentiation
   into northern and southern cpDNA groups dates to near the onset of the
   Quaternary and suggests that an ancient phylogeographic pattern has
   survived through several glacial periods. Our data provide evidence that
   the species has persisted for a long period with a highly fragmented and
   probably very localized distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Parasite communities on islands are assembled through multiple
   immigrations and/or in-situ diversification. In this study, we used a
   phylogenetic approach to investigate the role of such processes in
   shaping current patterns of diversity in Leucocytozoon, a group of
   haemosporidian blood parasites infecting whites eyes (Zosterops) endemic
   to the Mascarene archipelago (south-western Indian Ocean). We found that
   this parasite community arose through a combination of multiple
   immigrations and in-situ diversification, highlighting the importance of
   both processes in explaining island diversity. Specifically, two highly
   diverse parasite clades appear to have been present in the Mascarenes
   for most of their evolutionary history and have diversified within the
   archipelago, while another lineage apparently immigrated more recently,
   probably with human-introduced birds. Interestingly, the evolutionary
   histories of one clade of parasites and Indian Ocean Zosterops seem
   tightly associated with a significant signal for phylogenetic
   congruence, suggesting that hostparasite co-divergence may have occurred

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aspergillus flavus is the major producer of carcinogenic aflatoxins
   (AFs) in crops worldwide. Natural populations of A.similar to flavus
   show tremendous variation in AF production, some of which can be
   attributed to environmental conditions, differential regulation of the
   AF biosynthetic pathway and deletions or loss-of-function mutations in
   the AF gene cluster. Understanding the evolutionary processes that
   generate genetic diversity in A.similar to flavus may also explain
   quantitative differences in aflatoxigenicity. Several population studies
   using multilocus genealogical approaches provide indirect evidence of
   recombination in the genome and specifically in the AF gene cluster.
   More recently, A.similar to flavus has been shown to be functionally
   heterothallic and capable of sexual reproduction in laboratory crosses.
   In the present study, we characterize the progeny from nine A.similar to
   flavus crosses using toxin phenotype assays, DNA sequence-based markers
   and array comparative genome hybridization. We show high AF heritability
   linked to genetic variation in the AF gene cluster, as well as
   recombination through the independent assortment of chromosomes and
   through crossing over within the AF cluster that coincides with inferred
   recombination blocks and hotspots in natural populations. Moreover, the
   vertical transmission of cryptic alleles indicates that while an
   A.similar to flavus deletion strain is predominantly homokaryotic, it
   may harbour AF cluster genes at a low copy number. Results from
   experimental matings indicate that sexual recombination is driving
   genetic and functional hyperdiversity in A.similar to flavus. The
   results of this study have significant implications for managing AF
   contamination of crops and for improving biocontrol strategies using
   nonaflatoxigenic strains of A.similar to flavus.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism(s) that favour cooperation among individuals
   competing for the same resources provides direct insights into the
   evolution of grouping behaviour. In a hybrid zone between
   golden-/yellow-collared (Manacus vitellinus) and white-collared (Manacus
   candei) manakins, males form aggregations composed of white and yellow
   males solely to attract females (mixed leks). Previous work shows that
   yellow males in these mixed leks experience a clear mating advantage
   over white males, resulting in the preferential introgression of yellow
   plumage allele(s) into the white species. However, the yellow male
   mating advantage only occurs in mixed leks with high frequencies of
   yellow males, and only a few of these males probably mate. Hence, it
   remains unclear why unsuccessful males join leks. Here, we used
   microsatellite markers to estimate pairwise relatedness among males
   within and between leks to test whether indirect genetic benefits of
   helping kin (kin selection) can promote grouping. We found that yellow
   males are significantly more related to each other within than between
   leks, while relatedness among white males did not differ within and
   between leks. This suggests that yellow males may indirectly enhance
   their own reproductive success by preferentially lekking with relatives
   because yellow plumage is under positive frequency-dependent selection
   (positive FDS). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that kin
   selection may promote grouping and facilitate positive FDS for yellow
   males, mediating the movement of yellow plumage across this hybrid zone.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding is common in small and threatened populations and often has a
   negative effect on individual fitness and genetic diversity. Thus,
   inbreeding can be an important factor affecting the persistence of small
   populations. In this study, we investigated the effects of inbreeding on
   fitness in a small, wild population of house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus) on the island of Aldra, Norway. The population was founded
   in 1998 by four individuals (one female and three males). After the
   founder event, the adult population rapidly increased to about 30
   individuals in 2001. At the same time, the mean inbreeding coefficient
   among adults increased from 0 to 0.04 by 2001 and thereafter fluctuated
   between 0.06 and 0.10, indicating a highly inbred population. We found a
   negative effect of inbreeding on lifetime reproductive success, which
   seemed to be mainly due to an effect of inbreeding on annual
   reproductive success. This resulted in selection against inbred females.
   However, the negative effect of inbreeding was less strong in males,
   suggesting that selection against inbred individuals is at least partly
   sex specific. To examine whether individuals avoided breeding with close
   relatives, we compared observed inbreeding and kinship coefficients in
   the population with those obtained from simulations of random mating. We
   found no significant differences between the two, indicating weak or
   absent inbreeding avoidance. We conclude that there was inbreeding
   depression in our population. Despite this, birds did not seem to
   actively avoid mating with close relatives, perhaps as a consequence of
   constraints on mating possibilities in such a small population.}},

Abstract = {{One of the reasons for animals not to grow as fast as they potentially
   could is that fast growth has been shown to be associated with reduced
   lifespan. However, we are still lacking a clear description of the
   reality of growth-dependent modulation of ageing mechanisms in wild
   animals. Using the particular growth trajectory of small king penguin
   chicks naturally exhibiting higher-than-normal growth rate to compensate
   for the winter break, we tested whether oxidative stress and telomere
   shortening are related to growth trajectories. Plasma antioxidant
   defences, oxidative damage levels and telomere length were measured at
   the beginning and at the end of the post-winter growth period in three
   groups of chicks (small chicks, which either passed away or survived the
   growth period, and large chicks). Small chicks that died early during
   the growth period had the highest level of oxidative damage and the
   shortest telomere lengths prior to death. Here, we show that small
   chicks that grew faster did it at the detriment of body maintenance
   mechanisms as shown by (i) higher oxidative damage and (ii) accelerated
   telomere loss. Our study provides the first evidence for a mechanistic
   link between growth and ageing rates under natural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungi have substantial potential to influence plant
   distribution, especially in specialized orchids and mycoheterotrophic
   plants. However, little is known about environmental factors that
   influence the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi. Previous studies using
   seed packets have been unable to distinguish whether germination
   patterns resulted from the distribution of appropriate edaphic
   conditions or the distribution of host fungi, as these cannot be
   separated using seed packets alone. We used a combination of organic
   amendments, seed packets and molecular assessment of soil fungi required
   by three terrestrial orchid species to separate direct and indirect
   effects of fungi and environmental conditions on both seed germination
   and subsequent protocorm development. We found that locations with
   abundant mycorrhizal fungi were most likely to support seed germination
   and greater growth for all three orchids. Organic amendments affected
   germination primarily by affecting the abundance of appropriate
   mycorrhizal fungi. However, fungi associated with the three orchid
   species were affected differently by the organic amendments and by
   forest successional stage. The results of this study help contextualize
   the importance of fungal distribution and abundance to the population
   dynamics of plants with specific mycorrhizal requirements. Such
   phenomena may also be important for plants with more general mycorrhizal
   associations.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic plant species
   associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Previous studies have
   shown that some species are highly specialized towards narrow lineages
   of AMF and have suggested that only particular lineages of these fungi
   are targeted by mycoheterotrophic plants. To test this hypothesis, we
   analyzed all available partial SSU sequences of AMF associated with
   mycoheterotrophic plants including data from 13 additional specimens
   from French Guiana, Gabon and Australia. Sequences were assigned to
   virtual taxa (VT) according to the MaarjAM database. We found that 20\%
   of all known Glomeromycota VT are involved in mycoheterotrophic
   interactions and the majority of associations involve Glomeraceae
   (Glomus Group A) fungi. While some mycoheterotrophic plant species have
   been found growing with only a single VT, many species are able to
   associate with a wide range of AMF. We calculated significant
   phylogenetic clustering of Glomeromycota VT involved in
   mycoheterotrophic interactions, suggesting that associations between
   mycoheterotrophic plants and AMF are influenced by the phylogenetic
   relationships of the fungi. Our results demonstrate that many lineages
   of AMF are prone to exploitation by mycoheterotrophic plants. However,
   mycoheterotrophs from different plant lineages and different
   geographical regions tend to be dependent on lineages of AMF that are
   phylogenetically related.}},

Abstract = {{Deep sea environments cover more than 65\% of the earths surface and
   fulfil a range of ecosystem functions, yet they are also amongst the
   least known habitats on earth. Whilst the discovery of key geological
   processes, combined with technological developments, has focused
   interest onto geologically active areas such as hydrothermal vents, most
   abyssal biodiversity remains to be discovered (Danovaro 2010). However,
   as for terrestrial reservoirs of biodiversity, the worlds largest biome
   is under threat from anthropogenic activities ranging from environmental
   change to the exploitation of minerals and rare-earth elements (Kato
   2011). It is therefore important to understand the magnitude, nature and
   composition of deep sea biological communities to inform us of levels of
   local adaptation, functionality and resilience with respect to future
   environmental perturbation. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Bik et
   similar to al. utilize 454 Roche metagenetic environmental sequencing to
   assess microbial metazoan community composition and phylogenetic
   identity across deep sea depth gradients and between ocean basins. The
   analyses suggest that although the majority of microbial eukaryotic taxa
   are regionally restricted, a small percentage might maintain
   cosmopolitan deep sea distributions, and an even smaller fraction appear
   to be eurybathic (live across depth gradients).}},

Abstract = {{In long-lived, clonally reproducing species, assessing organism size is
   a nontrivial endeavour because each genetically distinct entity (genet)
   may comprise multiple modular units (ramets). Attributes of clonally
   reproducing populations, such as genet size, longevity and clonal
   diversity (the number of genets in a population), have significant
   implications for the persistence of populations over time. In the
   context of climate change, population persistence contributes to
   community stability and ecosystem resilience. Do clonal individuals
   persist through periods of climatic oscillations? Are clonal populations
   composed of a few large and persistent clones, or do they include clones
   of different sizes and ages? In this issue, de Witte (2012) present an
   exciting analysis of clonal diversity and genet longevity in populations
   of four arctic-alpine plant species with contrasting life histories:
   Carex curvula, Dryas octopetala, Salix herbacea and Vaccinium
   uliginosum. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data,
   the authors demonstrate that genet size ranged from a few centimetres to
   18 metres and age estimates for the largest genets ranged from 500 to
   4900 years. These data reveal that clonally reproducing populations
   include individuals that have outlived significant changes in climate.
   Despite the longevity of some individuals, clonal diversity within
   populations was high, with most individuals existing as small,
   relatively young genets. Long-lived individuals, together with high
   numbers of younger plants, ensure repeated recruitment and population
   persistence over time. This study represents a novel and timely
   contribution to a growing body of work aimed at understanding population
   persistence in changing climates.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly virulent lagovirus
   endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit,
   Oryctolagus cuniculus. It has also caused several unexplained disease
   outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. Non-pathogenic
   spread of RHDV leading to persistent infection which later reactivated
   has recently been proposed as the cause of overt disease and death of a
   pet rabbit in Canada, the first confirmed case of Rabbit haemorrhagic
   disease in that country. We suggest that there is little evidence to
   support non-pathogenic spread of virulent RHDV, some evidence that is
   contradictory, and evidence to support a simpler alternative hypothesis.
   RHDV can be spread over long distances between sparse rabbit populations
   by fomites or flying insects. Although highly pathogenic, RHDV can be
   limited in its spread within rabbit populations, or its presence masked
   by closely related but non-pathogenic lagoviruses which can provide
   protection against acute disease. In the absence of any evidence from
   clinical studies to support reactivation of persistent RHDV infection,
   the simpler explanation seems more likely to be correct.}},

Abstract = {{Following the announcement of the first case of rabbit haemorrhagic
   disease (RHD) in a pet rabbit, housed indoors in Canada for more than 1
   year, I submitted an evidence-based explanation to ProMed explaining how
   RHD might have caused the death of one of the three pet rabbits. I
   suggested with supporting evidence, that it may have been persistently
   infected with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) which may have
   reactivated to cause the fatal disease. However, in this issue, Peacock
   et similar to al. have proposed an alternative hypothesis for the
   appearance of RHD in the pet rabbit. They hypothesise that a
   non-identified insect or fomite might have become contaminated by a
   Chinese strain of RHDV somewhere in the US. This insect/fomite then flew
   or was windborne, from the US to Canada where it entered the house
   containing three pet rabbits and infected one of them. RHD is
   non-endemic and is rarely reported in the US, where it has only been
   observed in domestic European rabbits, held in rabbitries. My proposal
   was based on the details provided by ProMed, the veterinary report from
   Canada, where RHDV has never previously been identified and the
   epidemiological, ecological and evolutionary history of RHDV which
   includes serological and phylogenetic evidence that ancestral RHDV
   lineages circulated before 1984. The flying insect hypothesis of Peacock
   et similar to al. is based on circumstantial evidence and, I believe,
   has a lower probability of being correct than my evidence-based
   long-term infection proposal.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial eukaryotes (nematodes, protists, fungi, etc., loosely referred
   to as meiofauna) are ubiquitous in marine sediments and probably play
   pivotal roles in maintaining ecosystem function. Although the deep-sea
   benthos represents one of the worlds largest habitats, we lack a firm
   understanding of the biodiversity and community interactions amongst
   meiobenthic organisms in this ecosystem. Within this vast environment,
   key questions concerning the historical genetic structure of species
   remain a mystery, yet have profound implications for our understanding
   of global biodiversity and how we perceive and mitigate the impact of
   environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance. Using a metagenetic
   approach, we present an assessment of microbial eukaryote communities
   across depth (shallow water to abyssal) and ocean basins (deep-sea
   Pacific and Atlantic). Within the 12 sites examined, our results suggest
   that some taxa can maintain eurybathic ranges and cosmopolitan deep-sea
   distributions, but the majority of species appear to be regionally
   restricted. For Operationally Clustered Taxonomic Units (OCTUs)
   reporting wide distributions, there appears to be a taxonomic bias
   towards a small subset of taxa in most phyla; such bias may be driven by
   specific life history traits amongst these organisms. In addition, low
   genetic divergence between geographically disparate deep-sea sites
   suggests either a shorter coalescence time between deep-sea regions or
   slower rates of evolution across this vast oceanic ecosystem. While
   high-throughput studies allow for broad assessment of genetic patterns
   across microbial eukaryote communities, intragenomic variation in rRNA
   gene copies and the patchy coverage of reference databases currently
   present substantial challenges for robust taxonomic interpretations of
   eukaryotic data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the proteome (proteomics), which includes the dynamics of
   protein expression, regulation, interactions and its function, has
   played a less prominent role in evolutionary and ecological
   investigations in comparison with the study of the genome and
   transcriptome. There are, however, a number of arguments suggesting that
   this situation should change. First, the proteome is closer to the
   phenotype than the genome or the transcriptome, and as such may be more
   directly responsive to natural selection, and thus closely linked to
   adaptation. Second, there is evidence of a low correlation between
   protein and transcript expression levels across genes in many different
   organisms. Finally, there have been some recent important technological
   improvements in proteomics methods that make them feasible, practical
   and useful to address a wide range of evolutionary questions even in
   nonmodel organisms. The different proteomic methods, their limitations
   and problems when interpreting empirical data are described and
   discussed. In addition, the proteomic literature pertaining to
   evolutionary ecology is reviewed with examples, and potential
   applications of proteomics in a variety of evolutionary contexts are
   outlined. New proteomic research trends such as the study of
   posttranslational modifications and proteinprotein interactions, as well
   as the combined use of the different -omics approaches, are discussed in
   relation to the development of a more functional and integrated
   perspective, needed for achieving a more comprehensive knowledge of
   evolutionary change.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstructing and characterizing introduction routes is a key step
   towards understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying
   successful invasions and disease emergence. Here, we aimed to decipher
   scenarios of introduction and stochastic demographic events associated
   with the global spread of an emerging disease of bananas caused by the
   destructive fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella fijiensis. We analysed the
   worldwide population structure of this fungus using 21 microsatellites
   and 8 sequence-based markers on 735 individuals from 37 countries. Our
   analyses designated South-East Asia as the source of the global invasion
   and supported the location of the centre of origin of M. fijiensis
   within this area. We confirmed the occurrence of bottlenecks upon
   introduction into other continents followed by widespread founder events
   within continents. Furthermore, this study suggested contrasting
   introduction scenarios of the pathogen between the African and American
   continents. While potential signatures of admixture resulting from
   multiple introductions were detected in America, all the African samples
   examined seem to descend from a single successful founder event. In
   combination with historical information, our study reveals an original
   and unprecedented global scenario of invasion for this recently emerging
   disease caused by a wind-dispersed pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{The domestication of plants frequently results in a high level of
   genetic differentiation between domesticated plants and their wild
   progenitors. This process is counteracted by gene flow between wild and
   domesticated plants because they are usually able to inter-mate and to
   exchange genes. We investigated the extent of gene flow between wild
   barley Hordeum spontaneum and cultivated barley Hordeum vulgare, and its
   effect on population structure in wild barley by analysing a collection
   of 896 wild barley accessions (Barley1K) from Israel and all available
   Israeli H. vulgare accessions from the Israeli gene bank. We compared
   the performance of simple sequence repeats (SSR) and single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNP) marker data genotyped over a core collection in
   estimating population parameters. Estimates of gene flow rates with SSR
   markers indicated a high level of introgression from cultivated barley
   into wild barley. After removing accessions from the wild barley sample
   that were recently admixed with cultivated barley, the inference of
   population structure improved significantly. Both SSR and SNP markers
   showed that the genetic population structure of wild barley in Israel
   corresponds to the three major ecogeographic regions: the coast, the
   Mediterranean north and the deserts in the Jordan valley and the South.
   Gene flow rates were estimated to be higher from north to south than in
   the opposite direction. As has been observed in other crop species,
   there is a significant exchange of alleles between the wild species and
   domesticated varieties that needs to be accounted for in the population
   genetic analysis of domestication.}},

Abstract = {{A breakdown of self-incompatibility (SI) followed by a shift to selfing
   is commonly observed in the evolution of flowering plants. Both are
   expected to reduce the levels of heterozygosity and genetic diversity.
   However, breakdown of SI should most strongly affect the region of the
   SI locus (S-locus) because of the relaxation of balancing selection that
   operates on a functional S-locus, and a potential selective sweep. In
   contrast, a transition to selfing should affect the whole genome. We set
   out to disentangle the effects of breakdown of SI and transition to
   selfing on the level and distribution of genetic diversity in North
   American populations of Arabidopsis lyrata. Specifically, we compared
   sequence diversity of loci linked and unlinked to the S-locus for
   populations ranging from complete selfing to fully outcrossing.
   Regardless of linkage to the S-locus, heterozygosity and genetic
   diversity increased with population outcrossing rate. High
   heterozygosity of self-compatible individuals in outcrossing populations
   suggests that SI is not the only factor preventing the evolution of
   self-fertilization in those populations. There was a strong loss of
   diversity in selfing populations, which was more pronounced at the
   S-locus. In addition, selfing populations showed an accumulation of
   derived mutations at the S-locus. Our results provide evidence that
   beyond the genome-wide consequences of the population bottleneck
   associated with the shift to selfing, the S-locus of A. lyrata shows a
   specific signal either reflecting the relaxation of balancing selection
   or positive selection.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding patterns of connectivity among populations of marine
   organisms is essential for the development of realistic, spatially
   explicit models of population dynamics. Two approaches, empirical
   genetic patterns and oceanographic dispersal modelling, have been used
   to estimate levels of evolutionary connectivity among marine populations
   but rarely have their potentially complementary insights been combined.
   Here, a spatially realistic Lagrangian model of larval dispersal and a
   theoretical genetic model are integrated with the most extensive study
   of gene flow in a Caribbean marine organism. The 871 genets collected
   from 26 sites spread over the wider Caribbean subsampled 45.8\% of the
   1900 potential unique genets in the model. At a coarse scale,
   significant consensus between modelled estimates of genetic structure
   and empirical genetic data for populations of the reef-building coral
   Montastraea annularis is observed. However, modelled and empirical data
   differ in their estimates of connectivity among northern Mesoamerican
   reefs indicating that processes other than dispersal may dominate here.
   Further, the geographic location and porosity of the previously
   described eastwest barrier to gene flow in the Caribbean is refined. A
   multi-prong approach, integrating genetic data and spatially realistic
   models of larval dispersal and genetic projection, provides
   complementary insights into the processes underpinning population
   connectivity in marine invertebrates on evolutionary timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Among the environmental threats to coral reef health, temperature and
   ultraviolet increases have been proposed as major agents, although the
   relative contribution of each in the cnidarian/zooxanthellae symbiosis
   breakdown has been poorly addressed. We have investigated the
   transcriptomic response to thermal stress, with and without ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR), in the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Using
   the Oligo2K A.similar to viridis microarray, dedicated to genes
   potentially involved in the symbiosis interaction, we monitored the gene
   expression profiles after 1, 2 and 5 days of stresses that further lead
   to massive losses of zooxanthellae. Each stress showed a specific gene
   expression profile with very little overlap. We showed that the major
   response to thermal stress is immediate (24 h) but returns to the
   baseline gene expression profile after 2 days. UVR alone has little
   effect but potentiates thermal stress, as a second response at 5 days
   was observed when the two stresses were coupled. Several pathways were
   highlighted, such as mesoglea loosening, cell death and calcium
   homeostasis and described in more details. Finally, we showed that the
   dermatopontin gene family, potentially involved in collagen
   fibrillogenesis, issued from actinarian-specific duplication events,
   with one member preferentially expressed in the gastroderm and
   specifically responding to stress.}},

Abstract = {{Among elephants, the phylogeographic patterns of mitochondrial (mt) and
   nuclear markers are often incongruent. One hypothesis attributes this to
   sex differences in dispersal and in the variance of reproductive
   success. We tested this hypothesis by examining the coalescent dates of
   genetic markers within elephantid lineages, predicting that lower
   dispersal and lower variance in reproductive success among females would
   have increased mtDNA relative to nuclear coalescent dates. We sequenced
   the mitochondrial genomes of two forest elephants, aligning them to
   mitogenomes of African savanna and Asian elephants, and of woolly
   mammoths, including the most divergent mitogenomes within each lineage.
   Using fossil calibrations, the divergence between African elephant F and
   S clade mitochondrial genomes (originating in forest and savanna
   elephant lineages, respectively) was estimated as 5.5 Ma. We estimated
   that the (African) ancestor of the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages
   diverged 6.0 Ma, indicating that four elephantid lineages had
   differentiated in Africa by the MiocenePliocene transition, concurrent
   with drier climates. The coalescent date for forest elephant mtDNAs was
   c. 2.4 Ma, suggesting that the decrease in tropical forest cover during
   the Pleistocene isolated distinct African forest elephant lineages. For
   all elephantid lineages, the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear coalescent dates
   was much greater than 0.25. This is consistent with the expectation that
   sex differences in dispersal and in variance of reproductive success
   would have increased the effective population size of mtDNA relative to
   nuclear markers in elephantids, contributing to the persistence of
   incongruent mtDNA phylogeographic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Integrative taxonomy is a recently developed approach that uses multiple
   lines of evidence such as molecular, morphological, ecological and
   geographical data to test species limits, and it stands as one of the
   most promising approaches to species delimitation in taxonomically
   difficult groups. The Pnigalio soemius complex (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)
   represents an interesting taxonomical and ecological study case, as it
   is characterized by a lack of informative morphological characters, deep
   mitochondrial divergence, and is susceptible to infection by
   parthenogenesis-inducing Rickettsia. We tested the effectiveness of an
   integrative taxonomy approach in delimiting species within the P.
   soemius complex. We analysed two molecular markers (COI and ITS2) using
   different methods, performed multivariate analysis on morphometric data
   and exploited ecological data such as hostplant system associations,
   geographical separation, and the prevalence, type and effects of
   endosymbiont infection. The challenge of resolving different levels of
   resolution in the data was met by setting up a formal procedure of data
   integration within and between conflicting independent lines of
   evidence. An iterative corroboration process of multiple sources of data
   eventually indicated the existence of several cryptic species that can
   be treated as stable taxonomic hypotheses. Furthermore, the integrative
   approach confirmed a trend towards host specificity within the presumed
   polyphagous P. soemius and suggested that Rickettsia could have played a
   major role in the reproductive isolation and genetic diversification of
   at least two species.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of exogenous selection in a natural hybrid zone between
   the pupfishes Cyprinodon atrorus and Cyprinodon bifasciatus was tested
   via spatio-temporal analyses of environmental and genetic change over
   winter, spring and summer for three consecutive years. A critical
   influence of exogenous selection on hybrid zone regulation was
   demonstrated by a significant relationship between environmental
   (salinity and temperature) and genetic (three diagnostic nuDNA loci)
   variation over space and time (seasons) in the Rio Churince system,
   Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. At sites environmentally more similar to
   parental habitats, the genetic composition of hybrids was stable and
   similar to the resident parental species, whereas complex admixtures of
   parental and hybrid genotypic classes characterized intermediate
   environments, as did the greatest change in allelic and genotypic
   frequencies across seasons. Within hybrids across the entire Rio
   Churince system, seasonal changes in allelic and genotypic frequencies
   were consistent with results from previous reciprocal transplant
   experiments, which showed C.bifasciatus to suffer high mortality (75\%)
   when exposed to the habitat of C.atrorus in winter (extreme temperature
   lows and variability) and summer (abrupt salinity change and extreme
   temperature highs and variability). Although unconfirmed, the
   distributional limits of C.atrorus and C.atrorus-like hybrids appear to
   be governed by similar constraints (predation or competition). The
   argument favouring evolutionary significance of hybridization in animals
   is bolstered by the results of this study, which links the importance of
   exogenous selection in a contemporary hybrid zone between C.atrorus and
   C.bifasciatus to previous demonstration of the long-term evolutionary
   significance of environmental variation and introgression on the
   phenotypic diversification Cuatro Cienegas Cyprinodon.}},

Abstract = {{To elucidate the evolutionary history of the genus Capsella, we included
   the hitherto poorly known species C.similar to orientalis and C.similar
   to thracica into our studies together with C.similar to grandiflora,
   C.similar to rubella and C.similar to bursa-pastoris. We sequenced the
   ITS and four loci of noncoding cpDNA regions (trnL F, rps16, trnH psbA
   and trnQ rps16). Sequence data were evaluated with parsimony and
   Bayesian analyses. Divergence time estimates were carried out with the
   software package BEAST. We also performed isozyme, cytological,
   morphological and biogeographic studies. Capsella orientalis
   (self-compatible, SC; 2n = 16) forms a clade (eastern lineage) with
   C.similar to bursa-pastoris (SC; 2n = 32), which is a sister clade
   (western lineage) to C.similar to grandiflora (self-incompatible, SI; 2n
   = 16) and C.similar to rubella (SC; 2n = 16). Capsella bursa-pastoris is
   an autopolyploid species of multiple origin, whereas the Bulgarian
   endemic C.similar to thracica (SC; 2n = 32) is allopolyploid and emerged
   from interspecific hybridization between C.similar to bursa-pastoris and
   C.similar to grandiflora. The common ancestor of the two lineages was
   diploid and SI, and its distribution ranged from eastern Europe to
   central Asia, predominantly confined to steppe-like habitats.
   Biogeographic dynamics during the Pleistocene caused geographic and
   genetic subdivisions within the common ancestor giving rise to the two
   extant lineages.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1239-1254}},

Abstract = {{Species of the marine meiofauna such as Gastrotricha are known to lack
   dispersal stages and are thus assumed to have low dispersal ability and
   low levels of gene flow between populations. Yet, most species are
   widely distributed, and this creates a paradox. To shed light on this
   apparent paradox, we test (i) whether such wide distribution may be due
   to misidentification and lumping of cryptic species with restricted
   distributions and (ii) whether spatial structures exist for the
   phylogeography of gastrotrichs. As a model, we used the genus Turbanella
   in NW Europe. DNA taxonomy using a mitochondrial and a nuclear marker
   supports distinctness of four traditional species (Turbanella
   ambronensis, T. bocqueti, T. mustela and T. cornuta) and provides
   evidence for two cryptic species within T. hyalina. An effect of
   geography on the within-species genetic structure is indeed present,
   with the potential for understanding colonization processes and for
   performing phylogeographic inference from microscopic animals. On the
   other hand, the occurrence of widely distributed haplotypes indicates
   long-distance dispersal as well, despite the assumed low dispersal
   ability of gastrotrichs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that survival of arctic-alpine organisms in
   peripheral or interior glacial refugia are not mutually exclusive and
   may both be involved in shaping an organisms Pleistocene history, yet
   potentially at different time levels. Here, we test this hypothesis in a
   high-mountain plant (diploid lineage of Senecio carniolicus, Asteraceae)
   from the Eastern European Alps, in which patterns of morphological
   variation and current habitat requirements suggest survival in both
   types of refugia. To this end, we used AFLPs, nuclear and plastid DNA
   sequences and analysed them, among others, within a graph theoretic
   framework and using novel Bayesian methods of phylogeographic inference.
   On the basis of patterns of genetic diversity, occurrence of rare
   markers, distribution of distinct genetic lineages and patterns of range
   connectivity both interior refugia in the formerly strongly glaciated
   central Alps and peripheral refugia along the southern margin of the
   Alps were identified. The presence of refugia congruently inferred by
   markers resolving at different time levels suggests that these refugia
   acted as such throughout several glacial cycles. The high degree of
   range persistence together with gradual range expansion, which contrasts
   with the extent of range shifts implied for other Alpine species, is
   likely responsible for incipient lineage differentiation evident from
   the genetic data. Replacing a simplistic peripheral vs. interior refugia
   dualism by more complex models involving both types of refugia and
   considering different time levels will help identifying common
   phylogeographic patterns with respect to, for instance, location of
   refugia and colonization routes and elucidating their underlying genetic
   and/or ecological causes.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of pathogen transmission are often social behaviours.
   These occur at local scales and are affected by landscape-scale
   population structure. Host populations frequently exist in patchy and
   isolated environments that create a continuum of genetic and social
   familiarity. Such variability has an important multispatial effect on
   pathogen spread. We assessed elk dispersal (i.e. likelihood of interdeme
   pathogen transmission) through spatially explicit genetic analyses. At a
   landscape scale, the elk population was composed of one cluster within a
   southeast-to-northwest cline spanning three spatially discrete
   subpopulations of elk across two protected areas in Manitoba (Canada).
   Genetic data are consistent with spatial variability in apparent
   prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in elk. Given the existing
   population structure, between-subpopulation spread of disease because of
   elk dispersal is unlikely. Furthermore, to better understand the risk of
   spread and distribution of the TB, we used a combination of
   close-contact logging biotelemetry and genetic data, which highlights
   how social intercourse may affect pathogen transmission. Our results
   indicate that close-contact interaction rate and duration did not covary
   with genetic relatedness. Thus, direct elk-to-elk transmission of
   disease is unlikely to be constrained to related individuals. That
   social intercourse in elk is not limited to familial groups provides
   some evidence pathogen transmission may be density-dependent. We show
   that the combination of landscape-scale genetics, relatedness and
   local-scale social behaviours is a promising approach to understand and
   predict landscape-level pathogen transmission within our system and
   within all social ungulate systems affected by transmissible diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Body mass (BM) and resting metabolic rates (RMR) are two inexorably
   linked traits strongly related to mammalian life histories. Yet, there
   have been no studies attempting to estimate heritable variation and
   covariation of BM and RMR in natural populations. We used a marker-based
   approach to construct a pedigree and then the animal model to estimate
   narrow sense heritability (h2) of these traits in a free-living
   population of weasels Mustela nivalisa small carnivore characterised by
   a wide range of BM and extremely high RMR. The most important factors
   affecting BM of weasels were sex and habitat type, whereas RMR was
   significantly affected only by seasonal variation of this trait. All
   environmental factors had only small effect on estimates of additive
   genetic variance of both BM and RMR. The amount of additive genetic
   variance associated with BM and estimates of heritability were high and
   significant in males (h2 = 0.61), but low and not significant in females
   (h2 = 0.32), probably due to small sample size for the latter sex. The
   results from the two-trait model revealed significant phenotypic (rP =
   0.62) and genetic correlation (rA = 0.89) between BM and whole body RMR.
   The estimate of heritability of whole body RMR (0.54) and BM corrected
   RMR (0.45) were lower than estimates of heritability for BM. Both
   phenotypic and genetic correlations between BM corrected RMR and BM had
   negative signals (rP = -0.42 and rA = -0.58). Our results indicate that
   total energy expenditures of individuals can quickly evolve through
   concerted changes in BM and RMR.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-mediated interactions between herbivorous arthropods and pathogens
   transmitted by herbivores are important determinants of the population
   dynamics of both types of organisms in the field. The role of plant
   defence in mediating these types of tripartite interactions have been
   recognized but rarely examined especially at the physiological and
   molecular levels. Our previous work shows that a worldwide invasive
   whitefly can establish mutualism with the begomovirus Tomato yellow leaf
   curl China virus (TYLCCNV) via crop plants. Here, we show that TYLCCNV
   and betasatellite co-infection suppresses jasmonic acid defences in the
   plant. Impairing or enhancing defences mediated by jasmonic acid in the
   plant enhances or depresses the performance of the whitefly. We further
   demonstrate that the pathogenicity factor beta C1 encoded in the
   betasatellite is responsible for the initiation of suppression on plant
   defences and contributes to the realization of the virusvector
   mutualism. By integrating ecological, mechanistic and molecular
   approaches, our study reveals a major mechanism of the plant-mediated
   mutualism between a virus and its vector. As the test plant is an
   important economic crop, the results also have substantial implications
   for developing novel strategies for management of crop viruses and the
   insect vectors associated with them.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated clonal diversity, genet size structure and genet
   longevity in populations of four arctic-alpine plants (Carex curvula,
   Dryas octopetala, Salix herbacea and Vaccinium uliginosum) to evaluate
   their persistence under past climatic oscillations and their potential
   resistance to future climate change. The size and number of genets were
   determined by an analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms and
   a standardized sampling design in several European arctic-alpine
   populations, where these species are dominant in the vegetation. Genet
   age was estimated by dividing the size by the annual horizontal size
   increment from in situ growth measurements. Clonal diversity was
   generally high but differed among species, and the frequency
   distribution of genet size was strongly left-skewed. The largest
   C.similar to urvula genet had an estimated minimum age of c. 4100 years
   and a maximum age of c. 5000 years, although 84.8\% of the genets in
   this species were <200 years old. The oldest genets of D.similar to
   octopetala, S.similar to herbacea and V.similar to uliginosum were found
   to be at least 500, 450 and 1400 years old, respectively. These results
   indicate that individuals in the studied populations have survived
   pronounced climatic oscillations, including the Little Ice Age and the
   postindustrial warming. The presence of genets in all size classes and
   the dominance of presumably young individuals suggest repeated
   recruitment over time, a precondition for adaptation to changing
   environmental conditions. Together, persistence and continuous genet
   turnover may ensure maximum ecosystem resilience. Thus, our results
   indicate that long-lived clonal plants in arctic-alpine ecosystems can
   persist, despite considerable climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of a social behaviour may affect the fitness of actors
   and recipients living in the present and in the future of the
   population. When there is a risk that a future reward will not be
   experienced in such a context, the value of that reward should be
   discounted; but by how much? Here, we evaluate social discount rates for
   delayed fitness rewards to group of recipients living at different
   positions in both space and time than the actor in a hierarchically
   clustered population. This is a population where individuals are grouped
   into families, families into villages, villages into clans, and so on,
   possibly ad infinitum. The group-wide fitness effects are assumed to
   either increase or decrease the fecundity or the survival of recipients
   and can be arbitrarily extended in space and time. We find that actions
   changing the survival of individuals living in the future are generally
   more strongly discounted than fecundity-changing actions for all future
   times and that the value of future rewards increases as individuals live
   longer. We also find that delayed fitness effects may not only be
   discounted by a constant factor per unit delay (exponential
   discounting), but that, as soon as there is localized dispersal in a
   population, discounting per unit delay is likely to fall rapidly for
   small delays and then slowly for longer delays (hyperbolic discounting).
   As dispersal tends to be localized in natural populations, our results
   suggest that evolution is likely to favour individuals that express
   present-biased behaviours and that may be time-inconsistent with respect
   to their group-wide effects.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{493-504}},

Abstract = {{Philopatry and dispersal result in selection of habitat locations that
   may differ in resources and social environment and thus should influence
   fitness components like survival and reproduction. We examined
   short-distance movements of young and adult females from natal or
   previous nesting sites within a colony of Columbian ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus columbianus) in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada,
   over a 17-year period. Females of all ages were strongly philopatric,
   yet a few (1015\%) exhibited movements that took them to new home
   ranges. We tested three hypotheses to explain the pattern of female
   natal and breeding movements: (1) that movements of philopatric females
   promote proximity to close kin; (2) that range shifts favour close kin
   via bequeathal of territory and (3) that dispersers move to lower
   density areas where competition for resources is lower. Tests of these
   three hypotheses revealed that: (1) philopatry and movements of young
   and older philopatric females led to proximity to mothers and local
   presence of close kin; (2) breeding dispersal did not result in
   bequeathal of home range to daughters, but movements of philopatric
   females suggested that they shared space with close kin and (3) adult
   females moved to new ranges with lower local densities, though
   dispersing females also left ranges where local density was
   significantly lower than for philopatric females. Natal and breeding
   movements among years produced two opportunities for territorial
   females: close spatial proximity to close kin via short philopatric
   movements, and habitats with fewer competitors via longer dispersal
   movements.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{505-523}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A good understanding of mammalian societies requires measuring patterns
   and comprehending processes of dispersal in each sex. We investigated
   dispersal behaviour in arvicoline rodents, a subfamily of mammals
   widespread in northern temperate environments and characterized by a
   multivoltine life cycle. In arvicoline rodents, variation in life
   history strategies occurs along a continuum from precocial to delayed
   maturation that reflects seasonal and ecological fluctuations. We
   compared dispersal across and within species focusing on the effects of
   external (condition-dependent) and internal (phenotype-dependent)
   factors. Our data revealed substantial, unexplained variation between
   species for dispersal distances and a strong variation within species
   for both dispersal distance and fraction. Some methodological aspects
   explained variation across studies, which cautions against comparisons
   that do not control for them. Overall, the species under consideration
   display frequent short-distance dispersal events and extremely flexible
   dispersal strategies, but they also have hitherto unexpected capacity to
   disperse long distances. Female arvicolines are predominantly
   philopatric relative to males, but we found no clear association between
   the mating system and the degree of sex bias in dispersal across
   species. Dispersal is a response to both various proximate and ultimate
   factors, including competition, inbreeding avoidance, mate searching and
   habitat quality. In particular, our review suggests that costs and
   benefits experienced during transience and settlement are prime
   determinants of condition dependence. Patterns of phenotype-dependent
   dispersal are idiosyncratic, except for a widespread association between
   an exploration/activity syndrome and natal dispersal. Consequences for
   population dynamics and genetic structures are discussed.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Empirical and theoretical studies have supported kin selection by
   demonstrating nepotism or modelling its conditions and consequences. As
   an alternative, we previously found that female Columbian ground
   squirrels had greater direct fitness when more close kin were present.
   Extending those results, we used population matrix methods to calculate
   minimum estimates of individual fitness, estimated direct and indirect
   components of fitness, estimated inclusive fitness by adding the direct
   fitness (stripped of estimated influences of the social environment) and
   indirect fitness components together, and finally looked for inclusive
   fitness benefits of associations with close kin who seem to be genial
   neighbours. We examined the estimated fitness of a sample of 35 females
   for which complete lifetimes were known for themselves, their mothers
   and their littermate sisters. Six of these females had no cosurviving
   adult close kin, and their direct fitness was significantly lower than
   29 females with such kin (? = 0.66 vs. ? = 1.23). The net fitness
   benefit of the presence of close kin was thus 0.57. The estimated
   indirect component of fitness through benefits to the direct fitness of
   close kin was 0.43. Thus, estimated inclusive fitness for females with
   cosurviving close kin (? = 1.09) was significantly greater than that for
   females without surviving close kin (viz., ? = 0.66). The presence of
   closely related and philopatric female kin appeared to result in
   considerable fitness benefits for female ground squirrels, perhaps
   through the behavioural mechanisms of lowered aggression and other forms
   of behavioural cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Social behaviour was proposed as a density-dependent intrinsic mechanism
   that could regulate an animal population by affecting reproduction and
   dispersal. Populations of the polygynous yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota
   flaviventris) fluctuate widely from year to year primarily driven by the
   number of weaned young. The temporal variation in projected population
   growth rate was driven mainly by changes in the age of first
   reproduction and fertility, which are affected by reproductive
   suppression. Dispersal is unrelated to population density, or the
   presence of the father; hence, neither of these limits population growth
   or acts as an intrinsic mechanism of population regulation; overall,
   intrinsic regulation seems unlikely. Sociality affects the likelihood of
   reproduction in that the annual probability of reproducing and the
   lifetime number of offspring are decreased by the number of older
   females and by the number of same-aged females present, but are
   increased by the number of younger adult females present. Recruitment of
   a yearling female is most likely when her mother is present; recruitment
   of philopatric females is much more important than immigration for
   increasing the number of adult female residents. Predation and
   overwinter mortality are the major factors limiting the number of
   resident adults. Social behaviour is not directed towards population
   regulation, but is best interpreted as functioning to maximize direct
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental change poses challenges to many organisms. The resilience
   of a species to such change depends on its ability to respond
   adaptively. Social flexibility is such an adaptive response, whereby
   individuals of both sexes change their reproductive tactics
   facultatively in response to fluctuating environmental conditions,
   leading to changes in the social system. Social flexibility focuses on
   individual flexibility, and provides a unique opportunity to study both
   the ultimate and proximate causes of sociality by comparing between
   solitary and group-living individuals of the same population: why do
   animals form groups and how is group-living regulated by the environment
   and the neuro-endocrine system? These key questions have been studied
   for the past ten years in the striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio. High
   population density favours philopatry and group-living, while
   reproductive competition favours dispersal and solitary-living. Studies
   of genetic parentage reveal that relative fitness of alternative
   reproductive tactics depends on the prevailing environment. Tactics have
   different fitness under constrained ecological conditions, when
   competitive ability is important. Under conditions with relaxed
   ecological constraints, alternative tactics can yield equal fitness.
   Both male and female striped mice display alternative reproductive
   tactics based on a single strategy, i.e. all individuals follow the same
   decision rules. These changes are regulated by endocrine mechanisms.
   Social flexibility is regarded as an adaptation to unpredictably
   changing environments, selecting for high phenotypic flexibility based
   on a broad reaction norm, not on genetic polymorphism for specific
   tactics.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of kin discrimination inferred from pedigrees and the spatial

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3, SI}},

Abstract = {{Where animals avoid inbreeding, different mechanisms of kin
   discrimination can leave different signatures in the patterns of
   observed mate relationship. For example, consider a species with no
   paternal care. If a female avoids mating with familiar individuals, one
   would expect a deficit of offspring whose parents are maternal
   half-siblings, but paternal half-siblings would be unfamiliar with each
   other and thus have offspring at the frequency expected by chance. If
   spatial cues are used to avoid inbreeding, a female would be expected to
   produce few offspring with males (even unrelated males) living near her
   birth site. We searched for these and other signatures with data from a
   long-term study of banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis,
   in Arizona, USA, using a combination of intensive censusing, mapping of
   available dens, microsatellite-based parentage determination, and a
   randomization routine that determines the numbers of offspring expected
   if females in the population mate indiscriminately among the males
   available to them. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that
   kangaroo rats discriminate kin by familiarity developed via association
   early in life, rather than by using spatial cues or self-referential
   phenotype matching. Our approach should be widely applicable as a means
   of assessing the degree to which kin discrimination exists (in contexts
   like nepotism as well as inbreeding avoidance) and in inferring what
   cues animals use to assess categories of relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals are generally predicted to avoid inbreeding because of
   detrimental fitness effects. However, several recent studies have shown
   that limited inbreeding is tolerated by some vertebrate species. Here,
   we examine the costs and benefits of inbreeding in a largely polygynous
   rodent, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris). We use a
   pedigree constructed from 8 years of genetic data to determine the
   relatedness of all marmots in our study population and examine offspring
   survival, annual male reproductive success, relatedness between breeding
   pairs and the effects of group composition on likelihood of male
   reproduction to assess inbreeding in this species. We found decreased
   survival in inbred offspring, but equal net reproductive success among
   males that inbred and those that avoided it. Relatedness between
   breeding pairs was greater than that expected by chance, indicating that
   marmots do not appear to avoid breeding with relatives. Further, male
   marmots do not avoid inbreeding: males mate with equal frequency in
   groups composed of both related and unrelated females and in groups
   composed of only female relatives. Our results demonstrate that
   inbreeding can be tolerated in a polygynous species if the reproductive
   costs of inbreeding are low and individuals that mate indiscriminately
   do not suffer decreased reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{The formal testing of mating system theories with empirical data is
   important for evaluating the relative importance of different processes
   in shaping mating systems in wild populations. Here, we present a
   generally applicable probability modelling framework to test the role of
   local mate availability in determining a populations level of genetic
   monogamy. We provide a significance test for detecting departures in
   observed mating patterns from model expectations based on mate
   availability alone, allowing the presence and direction of behavioural
   effects to be inferred. The assessment of mate availability can be
   flexible and in this study it was based on population density, sex ratio
   and spatial arrangement. This approach provides a useful tool for (1)
   isolating the effect of mate availability in variable mating systems and
   (2) in combination with genetic parentage analyses, gaining insights
   into the nature of mating behaviours in elusive species. To illustrate
   this modelling approach, we have applied it to investigate the variable
   mating system of the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami)
   and compared the model expectations with the outcomes of genetic
   parentage analysis over an 18-year study. The observed level of monogamy
   was higher than predicted under the model. Thus, behavioural traits,
   such as mate guarding or selective mate choice, may increase the
   population level of monogamy. We show that combining genetic parentage
   data with probability modelling can facilitate an improved understanding
   of the complex interactions between behavioural adaptations and
   demographic dynamics in driving mating system variation.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the genetic factors influencing mate choice in
   humans. Still, there is evidence for non-random mate choice with respect
   to physical traits. In addition, some studies suggest that the Major
   Histocompatibility Complex may affect pair formation. Nowadays, the
   availability of high density genomic data sets gives the opportunity to
   scan the genome for signatures of non-random mate choice without prior
   assumptions on which genes may be involved, while taking into account
   socio-demographic factors. Here, we performed a genome scan to detect
   extreme patterns of similarity or dissimilarity among spouses throughout
   the genome in three populations of African, European American, and
   Mexican origins from the HapMap 3 database. Our analyses identified
   genes and biological functions that may affect pair formation in humans,
   including genes involved in skin appearance, morphogenesis, immunity and
   behaviour. We found little overlap between the three populations,
   suggesting that the biological functions potentially influencing mate
   choice are population specific, in other words are culturally driven.
   Moreover, whenever the same functional category of genes showed a
   significant signal in two populations, different genes were actually
   involved, which suggests the possibility of evolutionary convergences.}},

Abstract = {{In the human species, the two uniparental genetic systems (mitochondrial
   DNA and Y chromosome) exhibit contrasting diversity patterns. It has
   been proposed that sex-specific behaviours, and in particular
   differences in migration rate between men and women, may explain these
   differences. The availability of high-density genomic data and the
   comparison of genetic patterns on autosomal and sex chromosomes at
   global and local scales allow a reassessment of the extent to which
   sex-specific behaviours shape our genome. In this article, we first
   review studies comparing the genetic patterns at uniparental and
   biparental genetic systems and assess the extent to which sex-specific
   migration processes explain the differences between these genetic
   systems. We show that differences between male and female migration
   rates matter, but that they are certainly not the only contributing
   factor. In particular, differences in effective population size between
   men and women are also likely to account for these differences. Then, we
   present and discuss three anthropological processes that may explain

Abstract = {{Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are large mammalian carnivores, but
   their societies, called clans, resemble those of such cercopithecine
   primates as baboons and macaques with respect to their size,
   hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both
   kin and unrelated group-mates. However, in contrast to cercopithecine
   primates, spotted hyenas regularly hunt antelope and compete with
   group-mates for access to kills, which are extremely rich food sources,
   but also rare and ephemeral. This unique occurrence of baboon-like
   sociality among top-level predators has favoured the evolution of many
   unusual traits in this species. We briefly review the relevant
   socio-ecology of spotted hyenas, document great demographic variation
   but little variation in social structure across the species range, and
   describe the long-term fitness consequences of rank-related variation in
   resource access among clan-mates. We then summarize patterns of genetic
   relatedness within and between clans, including some from a population
   that had recently gone through a population bottleneck, and consider the
   roles of sexually dimorphic dispersal and female mate choice in the
   generation of these patterns. Finally, we apply social network theory
   under varying regimes of resource availability to analyse the effects of
   kinship on the stability of social relationships among members of one
   large hyena clan in Kenya. Although social bonds among both kin and
   non-kin are weakest when resource competition is most intense, hyenas
   sustain strong social relationships with kin year-round, despite
   constraints imposed by resource limitation. Our analyses suggest that
   selection might act on both individuals and matrilineal kin groups
   within clans containing multiple matrilines.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological, behavioural and genetic factors
   influencing animal social systems is crucial to investigating the
   evolution of sociality. Despite the recent advances in population
   genetic methods and the analysis of social interactions, long-term
   studies exploring the causes and consequences of social systems in wild
   mammals are rare. Here, we provide a synthesis of 15 years of data on
   the Bechsteins bat (Myotis bechsteinii), a species that raises its young
   in closed societies of 1045 females living together for their entire
   lives and where immigration is virtually absent. We discuss the
   potential causes and consequences of living in closed societies, based
   on the available data on Bechsteins bat and other species with similar
   social systems. Using a combination of observational and genetic data on
   the bats together with genetic data on an ecto-parasite, we suggest that
   closed societies in Bechsteins bats are likely caused by a combination
   of benefits from cooperation with familiar colony members and parasite
   pressure. Consequences of this peculiar social system include increased
   sensitivity to demographic fluctuations and limits to dispersal during
   colony foundation, which have broad implications for conservation. We
   also hope to illustrate by synthesizing the results of this long-term
   study the diversity of tools that can be applied to hypothesize about
   the factors influencing a species social system. We are convinced that
   with the expansion of the number of social mammals for which comparably
   detailed socio-genetic long-term data are available, future comparative
   studies will provide deeper insights into the evolution of closed
   societies.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of ecology and social organization on genetic structure at
   landscape spatial scales, where gene dynamics shape evolution as well as
   determine susceptibility to habitat fragmentation, is poorly understood.
   Attempts to assess these effects must take into account the potentially
   confounding effects of history. We used microsatellites to compare
   genetic structure in seven bat species with contrasting patterns of
   roosting ecology and social organization, all of which are codistributed
   in an ancient forest habitat that has been exceptionally buffered from
   radical habitat shifts. Over one thousand individuals were captured at
   foraging sites and genotyped at polymorphic microsatellite loci.
   Analyses of spatially explicit genotype data revealed interspecies
   differences in the extent of movement and gene flow and genetic
   structure across continuous intact forest. Highest positive genetic
   structure was observed in tree-roosting taxa that roost either alone or
   in small groups. By comparison, a complete absence of genetic
   autocorrelation was noted in the cave-roosting colonial species across
   the study area. Our results thus reveal measurable interspecies
   differences in the natural limits of gene flow in an unmodified habitat,
   which we attribute to contrasting roosting ecology and social
   organization. The consequences of ecology and behaviour for gene flow
   have important implications for conservation. In particular,
   tree-roosting species characterized by lower vagility and thus gene flow
   will be disproportionally impacted by landscape-scale forest clearance
   and habitat fragmentation, which are prevalent in the study region. Our
   method also highlights the usefulness of rapid sampling of foraging bats
   for assaying genetic structure, particularly where roosting sites are
   not always known.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal can be motivated by multiple factors including sociality.
   Dispersal behaviour affects population genetic structure that in turn
   reinforces social organization. We combined observational information
   with individual-based genetic data in the Karoo scrub-robin, a
   facultative cooperatively breeding bird, to understand how social bonds
   within familial groups affect mating patterns, cause sex asymmetry in
   dispersal behaviour and ultimately influence the evolution of dispersal.
   Our results revealed that males and females do not have symmetrical
   roles in structuring the population. Males are extremely philopatric and
   tend to delay dispersal until they gain a breeding position within a
   radius of two territories around the natal site. By contrast, females
   dispersed over larger distances, as soon as they reach independence.
   This resulted in male neighbourhoods characterized by high genetic
   relatedness. The long-distance dispersal strategy of females ensured
   that Karoo scrub-robins do not pair with relatives thereby compensating
   for male philopatry caused by cooperation. The observed female-biased
   strategy seems to be the most prominent mechanism to reduce the risk of
   inbreeding that characterizes social breeding system. This study
   demonstrates that tying together ecological data, such as breeding
   status, determining social relationships with genetic data, such as
   kinship, provides valuable insights into the proximate causes of
   dispersal, which are central to any evolutionary interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental disturbance is predicted to play a key role in the
   evolution of animal social behaviour. This is because disturbance
   affects key factors underlying social systems, such as demography,
   resource availability and genetic structure. However, because natural
   disturbances are unpredictable there is little information on their
   effects on social behaviour in wild populations. Here, we investigated
   how a major wildfire affected cooperation (sharing of hollow trees) by a
   hollow-dependent marsupial. We based two alternative social predictions
   on the impacts of fire on population density, genetic structure and
   resources. We predicted an adaptive social response from previous work
   showing that kin selection in den-sharing develops as competition for
   den resources increases. Thus, kin selection should occur in burnt areas
   because the fire caused loss of the majority of hollow-bearing trees,
   but no detectable mortality. Alternatively, fire may have a disruptive
   social effect, whereby postfire home range-shifts neutralize fine-scale
   genetic structure, thereby removing opportunities for kin selection
   between neighbours. Both predictions occurred: the disruptive social
   effect in burnt habitat and the adaptive social response in adjacent
   unburnt habitat. The latter followed a massive demographic influx to
   unburnt refuge habitat that increased competition for dens, leading to a
   density-related kin selection response. Our results show remarkable
   short-term plasticity of animal social behaviour and demonstrate how the
   social effects of disturbance extend into undisturbed habitat owing to
   landscape-scale demographic shifts. We predicted long-term changes in
   kinship-based cooperative behaviour resulting from the genetic and
   resource impacts of forecast changes to fire regimes in these forests.}},

   compete with each other for resources or reproductive opportunities,
   thereby reducing the kin-selected benefits of altruism towards
   relatives. These counteracting forces of cooperation and competition
   among kin should be particularly pronounced in plurally breeding species
   with limited alternative breeding opportunities outside the natal group.
   However, little is still known about the costs of reproductive
   competition on females fitness and the victims potential
   counter-strategies. Here we summarize long-term behavioural, demographic
   and genetic data collected on a plurally breeding primate from
   Madagascar to illuminate mechanisms and effects of female reproductive
   competition, focusing on forcible eviction and potential reproductive
   restraint. The main results of our study indicate that females in groups
   of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) above a critical size suffer
   from competition from their close relatives: females in larger groups
   face an increased probability of not giving birth as well as a higher
   probability of being evicted, especially during the annual mating and
   birth seasons. Eviction is not predicted by the number of adult females,
   the number of close female relatives, female age or inter-annual
   variation in rainfall but only by total group size. Thus, eviction in
   this species is clearly linked with reproductive competition, it cannot
   be forestalled by reproductive restraint or having many relatives in the
   group, and it occurs in the absence of a clear dominance hierarchy. Our
   study therefore also underscores the notion that potential inclusive
   fitness benefits from living with relatives may have been generally
   over-rated and should not be taken for granted.}},

Abstract = {{In group living animals, especially among primates, there is consistent
   evidence that high-ranking males gain a higher reproductive output than
   low-ranking males. Primate studies have shown that male coalitions and
   sociality can impact male fitness; however, it remains unclear whether
   males could potentially increase their fitness by preferentially
   supporting and socializing with females. Here we investigate patterns of
   male interventions and the effect of coalitions and sociality on male
   fitness in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with particular focus on
   malefemale interactions. We combined behavioural observations collected
   on Cayo Santiago with genetic data analysed for male reproductive output
   and relatedness. Our results revealed that the ten top-ranking males
   provided the majority of all male support observed. In contrast to other
   primates, male rhesus macaques mainly formed all-down coalitions
   suggesting that coalitions are less likely used to enhance male
   dominance. Males supporting females during and before their likely
   conception were not more likely to fertilize those females. We also
   found no evidence that males preferably support their offspring or other
   close kin. Interestingly, the most important predictor of male support
   was sociality, since opponents sharing a higher sociality index with a
   given male were more likely to be supported. Furthermore, a high
   sociality index of a given malefemale dyad resulted in a higher
   probability of paternity. Overall, our results strengthen the evidence
   that sociality affects fitness in male primates, but also suggest that
   in species in which males queue for dominance, it is less likely that
   males derive fitness benefits from coalitions.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour and genetic structure are intimately related: mating patterns
   and patterns of movement between groups or populations influence the
   movement of genetic variation across the landscape and from one
   generation to the next. In hybrid zones, the behaviour of the
   hybridizing taxa can also impact the incidence and outcome of
   hybridization events. Hybridization between yellow baboons and anubis
   baboons has been well documented in the Amboseli basin of Kenya, where
   more anubis-like individuals tend to experience maturational and
   reproductive advantages. However, it is unknown whether these advantages
   are reflected in the genetic structure of populations surrounding this
   area. Here, we used microsatellite genotype data to evaluate the
   structure and composition of baboon populations in southern Kenya. Our
   results indicate that, unlike for mitochondrial DNA,
   microsatellite-based measures of genetic structure concord with
   phenotypically based taxonomic distinctions and that the currently
   active hybrid zone is relatively narrow. Isolation with migration
   analysis revealed asymmetric gene flow in this region from anubis
   populations into yellow populations, in support of the anubis-biased
   phenotypic advantages observed in Amboseli. Populations that are
   primarily yellow but that receive anubis gene flow exhibit higher levels
   of genetic diversity than yellow populations far from the introgression
   front. Our results support previous work that indicates a long history
   of hybridization and introgression among East African baboons.
   Specifically, it suggests that anubis baboons are in the process of
   gradual range expansion into the range of yellow baboons, a pattern
   potentially explained by behavioural and life history advantages that
   correlate with anubis ancestry.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of stable social groups can be promoted by both indirect
   and direct fitness benefits. Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are
   highly social, with a hierarchical social structure based around core
   groups of adult females and subadults, a rare level of complexity among
   mammals. We combined long-term satellite tracking (ranging from 11 to
   607 days) of 51 individual sperm whales with genetic kinship analysis to
   assess the pattern of kin associations within and among coherent social
   units. Unlike findings for other species with similar social structure,
   we find no consistent correlation between kinship and association apart
   from close associations between two pairs of first-order relatives. A
   third pair of first-order relatives did not associate, and overall, the
   mean relatedness was the same within as among social groups. However,
   social behaviour can also be promoted by ecological factors such as
   resource dispersion. We assessed putative foraging behaviour during
   travel from the satellite-tracking data, which suggested that prey
   resources were dispersed and unpredictable, a condition that could
   promote living in groups.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{745-764}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Social systems are the outcomes of natural and sexual selection on
   individuals efforts to maximize reproductive success. Ecological
   conditions, life history, demography traits and social aspects have been
   recognized as important factors shaping social systems. Delphinids show
   a wide range of social structures and large variation in life history
   traits and inhabit several aquatic environments. They are therefore an
   excellent group in which to investigate the interplay of ecological and
   intrinsic factors on the evolution of mammalian social systems in these
   environments. Here I synthetize results from genetic studies on
   dispersal patterns, genetic relatedness, kin associations and mating
   patterns and combine with ecological, life history and phylogenetic data
   to predict the formation of kin associations and bonding in these
   animals. I show that environment type impacts upon dispersal tendencies,
   with small delphinids generally exhibiting female-biased philopatry in
   inshore waters and bisexual dispersal in coastal and pelagic waters.
   When female philopatry occurs, they develop moderate social bonds with
   related females. Male bonding occurs in species with small male-biased
   sexual size dimorphism and male-biased operational sex ratio, and it is
   independent of dispersal tendencies. By contrast, large delphinids,
   which live in coastal and pelagic waters, show bisexual philopatry and
   live in matrilineal societies. I propose that sexual conflict favoured
   the formation of these stable societies and in turn facilitated the
   development of kin-biased behaviours. Studies on populations of the same
   species inhabiting disparate environments, and of less related species
   living in similar habitats, would contribute towards a comprehensive
   framework for the evolution of delphinid social systems.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic tools are increasingly valuable for understanding the behaviour,
   evolution, and conservation of social species. In African elephants, for
   instance, genetic data provide basic information on the population
   genetic causes and consequences of social behaviour, and how human
   activities alter elephants social and genetic structures. As such,
   African elephants provide a useful case study to understand the
   relationships between social behaviour and population genetic structure
   in a conservation framework. Here, we review three areas where genetic
   methods have made important contributions to elephant behavioural
   ecology and conservation: (1) understanding kin-based relationships in
   females and the effects of poaching on the adaptive value of elephant
   relationships, (2) understanding patterns of paternity in elephants and
   how poaching can alter these patterns, and (3) conservation genetic
   tools to census elusive populations, track ivory, and understand the
   behavioural ecology of crop-raiding. By comparing studies from
   populations that have experienced a range of poaching intensities, we
   find that human activities have a large effect on elephant behaviour and
   genetic structure. Poaching disrupts kin-based association patterns,
   decreases the quality of elephant social relationships, and increases
   male reproductive skew, with important consequences for population
   health and the maintenance of genetic diversity. In addition, we find
   that genetic tools to census populations or gather forensic information
   are almost always more accurate than non-genetic alternatives. These
   results contribute to a growing understanding of poaching on animal
   behaviour, and how genetic tools can be used to understand and conserve
   social species.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key features of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes
   is the frequent occurrence of trans-species polymorphism, that is the
   passage of allelic lineages from ancestral to descendant species (Klein
   2007). Selectively maintained ancestral polymorphism may, however, be
   hard to distinguish from introgression of MHC alleles between
   hybridizing species (Fig1). In this issue of Molecular Ecology,
   Nadachowska-Brzyska (2012) present data that suggest that the latter can
   be observed in two closely related species of newts, Lissotriton
   vulgaris (Lv) and L.montandoni (Lm) from south-east Europe. Strikingly,
   allelic MHC variation displayed more structure between geographically
   separated populations of L.vulgaris than across species in the hybrid
   zone. This suggests that high MHC variation in L.montadoni may result
   from mainly unidirectional gene flow between species, while
   differentiation between northern and southern populations of L.vulgaris
   might reflect local adaptation.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ecological speciation is defined as the emergence of reproductive
   isolation as a direct or indirect consequence of divergent ecological
   adaptation. Several empirical examples of ecological speciation have
   been reported in the literature which very often involve adaptation to
   biotic resources. In this review, we investigate whether adaptation to
   different thermal habitats could also promote speciation and try to
   assess the importance of such processes in nature. Our survey of the
   literature identified 16 animal and plant systems where divergent
   thermal adaptation may underlie (partial) reproductive isolation between
   populations or may allow the stable coexistence of sibling taxa. In many
   of the systems, the differentially adapted populations have a parapatric
   distribution along an environmental gradient. Isolation often involves
   extrinsic selection against locally maladapted parental or hybrid
   genotypes, and additional pre- or postzygotic barriers may be important.
   Together, the identified examples strongly suggest that divergent
   selection between thermal environments is often strong enough to
   maintain a bimodal genotype distribution upon secondary contact. What is
   less clear from the available data is whether it can also be strong
   enough to allow ecological speciation in the face of gene flow through
   reinforcement-like processes. It is possible that intrinsic features of
   thermal gradients or the genetic basis of thermal adaptation make such
   reinforcement-like processes unlikely but it is equally possible that
   pertinent systems are understudied. Overall, our literature survey
   highlights (once again) the dearth of studies that investigate similar
   incipient species along the continuum from initial divergence to full
   reproductive isolation and studies that investigate all possible
   reproductive barriers in a given system.}},

Abstract = {{The wild grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. ssp. sylvestris (Gmelin) Hegi,
   considered as the ancestor of the cultivated grapevine, is native from
   Eurasia. In Spain, natural populations of V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris
   can still be found along river banks. In this work, we have performed a
   wide search of wild grapevine populations in Spain and characterized the
   amount and distribution of their genetic diversity using 25 nuclear SSR
   loci. We have also analysed the possible coexistence in the natural
   habitat of wild grapevines with naturalized grapevine cultivars and
   rootstocks. In this way, phenotypic and genetic analyses identified 19\%
   of the collected samples as derived from cultivated genotypes, being
   either naturalized cultivars or hybrid genotypes derived from
   spontaneous crosses between wild and cultivated grapevines. The genetic
   diversity of wild grapevine populations was similar than that observed
   in the cultivated group. The molecular analysis showed that cultivated
   germplasm and wild germplasm are genetically divergent with low level of
   introgression. Using a model-based approach implemented in the software
   structure, we identified four genetic groups, with two of them
   fundamentally represented among cultivated genotypes and two among wild
   accessions. The analyses of genetic relationships between wild and
   cultivated grapevines could suggest a genetic contribution of wild
   accessions from Spain to current Western cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{We characterized patterns of genetic variation in populations of the
   fire ant Solenopsis invicta in China using mitochondrial DNA sequences
   and nuclear microsatellite loci to test predictions as to how propagule
   pressure and subsequent dispersal following establishment jointly shape
   the invasion success of this ant in this recently invaded area. Fire
   ants in Wuchuan (Guangdong Province) are genetically differentiated from
   those found in other large infested areas of China. The immediate source
   of ants in Wuchuan appears to be somewhere near Texas, which ranks first
   among the southern USA infested states in the exportation of goods to
   China. Most colonies from spatially distant, outlying areas in China are
   genetically similar to one another and appear to share a common source
   (Wuchuan, Guangdong Province), suggesting that long-distance jump
   dispersal has been a prevalent means of recent spread of fire ants in
   China. Furthermore, most colonies at outlier sites are of the polygyne
   social form (featuring multiple egg-laying queens per nest), reinforcing
   the important role of this social form in the successful invasion of new
   areas and subsequent range expansion following invasion. Several
   analyses consistently revealed characteristic signatures of genetic
   bottlenecks for S. invicta populations in China. The results of this
   study highlight the invasive potential of this pest ant, suggest that
   the magnitude of international trade may serve as a predictor of
   propagule pressure and indicate that rates and patterns of subsequent
   range expansion are partly determined by the interplay between species
   traits and the trade and transportation networks.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection, random processes and gene flow are known to generate
   sex ratio variations among sexually polymorphic plant populations. In
   gynodioecious species, in which hermaphrodites and females coexist, the
   relative effect of these processes on the maintenance of sex
   polymorphism is still up for debate. The aim of this study was to
   document sex ratio and cytonuclear genetic variation at a very local
   scale in wind-pollinated gynodioecious Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima and
   attempt to elucidate which processes explained the observed variation.
   The study sites were characterized by geographically distinct patches of
   individuals and appeared to be dynamic entities, with recurrent
   establishment of distinct haplotypes through independent founder events.
   Along with substantial variation in sex ratio and unexpectedly low gene
   flow within study sites, our results showed a high genetic
   differentiation among a mosaic of genetically distinct demes, with
   isolation by distance or abrupt genetic discontinuities taking place
   within a few tens of metres. Overall, random founder events with
   restricted gene flow could be primary determinants of sex structure, by
   promoting the clumping of sex-determining genes. Such high levels of sex
   structure provide a landscape for differential selection acting on
   sex-determining genes, which could modify the conditions of maintenance
   of gynodioecy in structured populations.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that genetic diversity and genetic differentiation may
   strongly vary among populations of the same species depending on
   population turnover and local population sizes. Yet, despite the
   importance of these predictions for evolutionary and conservation
   issues, empirical studies comparing high-turnover and low-turnover
   populations of the same species are scarce. In this study, we used
   Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean, as a model organism for such a
   comparison. In the southern/central part of its range, D. magna inhabits
   medium-sized, stable ponds, whereas in the north, it occurs in small
   rock pools with strong population turnover. We found that these northern
   populations have a significantly lower genetic diversity and higher
   genetic differentiation compared to the southern/central populations.
   Total genetic diversity across populations was only about half and
   average within-population diversity only about a third of that in
   southern/central populations. Moreover, an average southern population
   contains more genetic diversity than the whole metapopulation system in
   the north. We based our analyses both on silent sites and
   microsatellites. The similarity of our results despite the contrasting
   mutation rates of these markers suggests that the differences are caused
   by contemporary rather than by historical processes. Our findings show
   that variation in population turnover and population size may have a
   major impact on the genetic diversity and differentiation of
   populations, and hence may lead to differences in evolutionary processes
   like local adaptation, hybrid vigour and breeding system evolution in
   different parts of a species range.}},

   through time is difficult in natural populations. We applied four new
   methods for estimating Ne from a single sample of genotypes to trace
   temporal change in Ne for bears in the Northern Dinaric Mountains. We
   genotyped 510 bears using 20 microsatellite loci and determined their
   age. The samples were organized into cohorts with regard to the year
   when the animals were born and yearly samples with age categories for
   every year when they were alive. We used the Estimator by Parentage
   Assignment (EPA) to directly estimate both Ne and generation interval
   for each yearly sample. For cohorts, we estimated the effective number
   of breeders (Nb) using linkage disequilibrium, sibship assignment and
   approximate Bayesian computation methods and extrapolated these
   estimates to Ne using the generation interval. The Ne estimate by EPA is
   276 (183350 95\% CI), meeting the inbreeding-avoidance criterion of Ne >
   50 but short of the long-term minimum viable population goal of Ne >
   500. The results obtained by the other methods are highly consistent
   with this result, and all indicate a rapid increase in Ne probably in
   the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new single-sample approaches to the
   estimation of Ne provide efficient means for including Ne in monitoring
   frameworks and will be of great importance for future management and
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental changes, such as climate change, lead to the opening of
   new niches. In such situations, species that adapt to new niches can
   survive and/or expand their ranges. However, gene flow can hamper
   genetic adaptation to new environments. Alternatively, recent models
   have highlighted the importance of phenotypic plasticity in tracking
   environmental change. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic plasticity
   or genetic evolution (or both) allows an amphibian species to exploit
   two divergent climatic niches. In the Mediterranean region, the parsley
   frog Pelodytes punctatus breeds both in spring, as do most other
   species, and in autumn, a temporal niche not exploited by most other
   species, but which may become increasingly important with global
   warming. Conditions of development are dramatically different between
   the two seasons and deeply impact tadpole life-history traits. To
   determine whether these temporal niches are exploited by two genetically
   differentiated subpopulations, or whether the bimodal phenology arises
   in a panmictic population displaying plastic life-history traits, we use
   two complementary approaches. We measure both molecular genetic
   differentiation and quantitative-trait differentiation between spring
   and autumn cohorts, using microsatellites and common garden experiments,
   respectively. Seasonal cohorts were not genetically differentiated and
   differences in tadpole life history between cohorts were not maintained
   in laboratory conditions. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity, rather
   than genetic adaptation, allows Parsley frog to exploit two contrasting
   temporal niches.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms generating variation
   within the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   genes remains incomplete. Assessing MHC variation across multiple
   populations, of recent and ancient divergence, may facilitate
   understanding of geographical and temporal aspects of variation. Here,
   we applied 454 sequencing to perform a large-scale, comprehensive
   analysis of MHC class II in the closely related, hybridizing newts,
   Lissotriton vulgaris (Lv) and Lissotriton montandoni (Lm). Our study
   revealed an extensive (299 alleles) geographically structured
   polymorphism. Populations at the southern margin of the Lv distribution,
   inhabited by old and distinct lineages (southern Lv), exhibited moderate
   MHC variation and strong population structure, indicating little gene
   flow or extensive local adaptation. Lissotriton vulgaris in central
   Europe and the northern Balkans (northern Lv) and almost all Lm
   populations had a high MHC variation. A much higher proportion of MHC
   alleles was shared between Lm and northern Lv than between Lm and
   southern Lv. Strikingly, the average pairwise FST between northern Lv
   and Lm was significantly lower than between northern and southern Lv for
   MHC, but not for microsatellites. Thus, high MHC variation in Lm and
   northern Lv may result from gene flow between species. We hypothesize
   that the interspecific exchange of MHC genes may be facilitated by
   frequency-dependent selection. A marginally significant correlation
   between the MHC and microsatellite allelic richness indicates that
   demographic factors may have contributed to the present-day pattern of
   MHC variation, but unequivocal signatures of adaptive evolution in MHC
   class II sequences emphasize the role of selection on a longer
   timescale.}},

Abstract = {{Inferring the evolutionary and ecological processes that have shaped
   contemporary species distributions using the geographic distribution of
   gene lineages is the principal goal of phylogeographic research.
   Researchers in the field have recognized that inferences made from a
   single gene, often mitochondrial, can be informative regarding the
   pattern of diversification but lack conclusive information regarding the
   evolutionary mechanisms that led to the observed patterns. Here, we use
   a multilocus (20 loci) data set to explore the evolutionary history of
   the White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). A previous
   single-locus study found S. carolinensis is comprised of four
   reciprocally monophyletic clades geographically restricted to the pine
   and oak forests of: (i) eastern North America, (ii) southern Rocky
   Mountain and Mexican Mountain ranges, (iii) Eastern Sierra Nevada and
   Northern Rocky Mountains and (iv) Pacific slope of North America. The
   diversification of the clades was attributed to the fragmentation of
   North American pine and oak woodlands in the Pliocene with subsequent
   divergences owing to the Pleistocene glacial cycles. Principal
   component, clustering and species tree analyses of the multilocus data
   resolved the same four groups or lineages found in the single-locus
   study. Coalescent analyses and hypothesis testing of nested isolation
   and migration models indicate that isolation and not gene flow has been
   the major evolutionary mechanism responsible for shaping genetic
   variation, and all the divergence events within S. carolinensis have
   occurred in response to the Pleistocene glacial cycles.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{921-941}},

Abstract = {{Diversification of South American species endemic to open habitats has
   been attributed to both Tertiary events and Pleistocene climatic
   fluctuations. Nonetheless, phylogeographical studies of taxa in these
   regions are few, precluding generalizations about the timing and
   processes leading to differentiation and speciation. We inferred
   population structure of Hypsiboas albopunctatus, a frog widely
   distributed in the Brazilian Cerrado. Three geographically distinct
   lineages were recovered in our phylogeny. The Chapada dos Guimaraes (CG)
   clade was the first to diverge from other populations and contains
   multiple haplotypes from a single population in western Cerrado,
   probably representing a cryptic species. The southeast clade (SE)
   includes populations along the southeastern limit of the range within
   the historical distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Finally,
   the Central Cerrado (CC) group includes haplotypes from the interior of
   Brazil that are paraphyletic relative to the SE clade. Analyses of
   historical demography indicate significant population expansion in the
   CC and SE populations, likely associated with colonization of newly
   formed open habitats. The divergence of populations in the CG clade
   occurred in the late Miocene, concordant with the uplift of the central
   Brazilian plateau. Divergence of the SE clade from the CC occurred
   during the mid-Pleistocene. Thus, both Tertiary geological events and
   Pleistocene climatic fluctuations promoted divergences among lineages.
   Our study reveals a complex history of diversification in the Cerrado, a
   morphoclimatic domain highly threatened because of anthropogenic habitat
   alteration. We identified surprisingly deep divergences in a widely
   distributed frog, indicating that the Cerrado is not a barrier-free
   habitat and that its diversity is likely underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Southern South America provides a set of unusual geographic features
   that make it particularly interesting for studying phylogeography. The
   Andes Mountains run along a north-to-south axis and act as a barrier to
   gene flow for much of the biota of this region, with southern portions
   experiencing extensive historical glaciation. Geological data reveal a
   series of drainage reversals, shifting from Pacific Ocean outlets to
   Atlantic Ocean outlets because of glacier formation that dammed and
   reversed rivers. Once glaciers melted around 13 000 years ago, drainages
   returned to the Pacific Ocean. This geologic history predicts that
   aquatic organisms in Pacific rivers should have their closest
   relationships to their counterparts in Atlantic rivers immediately to
   their east. We tested this prediction in the trichomycterid catfish
   Hatcheria macraei from 38 locations using the mitochondrial cytochrome b
   gene. Our results show that most populations found in Pacific rivers
   were closely related to fish found in the adjacent Atlantic draining Rio
   Chubut. Surprisingly, one documented drainage reversal (from Rio Deseado
   into Rio Baker) did not result in movement of H. macraei. Overall, we
   found the lowest levels of genetic structure between most Pacific rivers
   that are adjacent to the Atlantic draining Rio Chubut. We also found low
   levels of population structuring among three of four contemporary river
   basins that drain to the Atlantic Ocean. Our findings suggest that
   drainage basin boundaries have historically not played an important
   long-term role in structuring between nine of 11 drainages, an unusual
   finding in freshwater biogeography.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation remains a fundamental issue in biology. Herein, we report an
   investigation into speciation in the Rana chensinensis species complex
   using DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial and five nuclear genes. A
   phylogenetic analysis of the data revealed four major clades in the
   complex, and each of them was found to likely represent a species,
   including one cryptic species. Ecological niche models were generated
   from 19 climatic variables for three of the four major clades, which
   were represented by widespread sampling, including R. chensinensis, Rana
   kukunoris and the potential cryptic species. Each clade is associated
   with a unique ecological unit, and this indicates that ecological
   divergence probably drove speciation. Ecological divergence is likely
   related to the late Cenozoic orogenesis of the QinghaiTibetan Plateau.
   In addition, gene flow between species was detected but only in
   peripheral portions of the ranges of the four major clades, thus likely
   had little influence on the speciation processes. Discordances between
   mitochondrial and nuclear genes were also found; the nominal species, R.
   chensinensis, contains multiple maternal clades, suggesting potential
   mitochondrial introgression between R. chensinensis and R. kukunoris.}},

Abstract = {{The inference of population divergence times and branching patterns is
   of fundamental importance in many population genetic analyses. Many
   methods have been developed for estimating population divergence times,
   and recently, there has been particular attention towards genome-wide
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data. However, most SNP data have
   been affected by an ascertainment bias caused by the SNP selection and
   discovery protocols. Here, we present a modification of an existing
   maximum likelihood method that will allow approximately unbiased
   inferences when ascertainment is based on a set of outgroup populations.
   We also present a method for estimating trees from the asymmetric
   dissimilarity measures arising from pairwise divergence time estimation
   in population genetics. We evaluate the methods by simulations and by
   applying them to a large SNP data set of seven East Asian populations.}},

Title = {{Parallel phylogeographic structure in ecologically similar sympatric

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{987-1004}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Present-day phylogeographic patterns have been shaped by the dual
   histories of lineages and places, producing a diversity of relationships
   that may challenge discovery of general rules. For example, the
   predicted positive correlation between dispersal ability and gene flow
   has been supported inconsistently, suggesting unaccounted complexity in
   theory or the comparative framework. Here, I extend the sympatric
   sister-species approach, in which variance between lineages and places
   is minimized, to sister clades and test a fundamental assumption of
   comparative genetic studies of dispersal: that taxa which evolved at the
   same time and in the same place will, if they have similar life
   histories and ecologies, have essentially the same phylogeographic
   structure. Phylogenetic analyses of 197 Stigmatopora pipefishes using
   two nuclear (creatine kinase intron 6, a-tropomyosin) and two
   mitochondrial (16S, noncoding region) loci revealed largely synchronous
   parallel diversification of sister clades that are codistributed from
   Western Australia to New Zealand, supporting the null hypothesis. Only
   one comparison, however, yielded a sympatric sister-species pair (the
   two stem species), so I also explored the potential for extant species
   sharing a substantial proportion of their evolutionary histories in
   sympatry to substitute for sister taxon comparisons. In eastern
   Australia, where strong environmental structure is lacking,
   phylogeographic differences between species that have been codistributed
   for similar to 85\% of their evolutionary histories were consistent with
   tendencies favoured by their modest life-history differences, that is
   the larger, rarer species had lower genetic diversity. In contrast, in
   New Zealand, two species codistributed for 70\% of their evolutionary
   histories were both structured similarly by a strong biogeographic
   filter despite differences in life history. Rigorously quantifying the
   influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on phylogeographic
   structure may advance most efficiently through meta-analyses of
   contemporaneously codistributed taxa, including but not limited to
   sympatric sister species.}},

Abstract = {{In northwestern Iberia, two largely allopatric Lacerta lepida
   mitochondrial lineages occur, L5 occurring to the south of Douro River
   and L3 to the north, with a zone of putative secondary contact in the
   region of the Douro River valley. Cytochrome b sequence chromatograms
   with polymorphisms at nucleotide sites diagnostic for the two lineages
   were detected in individuals in the region of the Douro River and
   further north within the range of L3. We show that these polymorphisms
   are caused by the presence of four different numts (IIV) co-occurring
   with the L3 genome, together with low levels of heteroplasmy. Two of the
   numts (I and II) are similar to the mitochondrial genome of L5 but are
   quite divergent from the mitochondrial genome of L3 where they occur. We
   show that these numts are derived from the mitochondrial genome of L5
   and were incorporated in L3 through hybridization at the time of
   secondary contact between the lineages. The additional incidence of
   these numts to the north of the putative contact zone is consistent with
   an earlier postglacial northward range expansion of L5, preceding that
   of L3. We show that genetic exchange between the lineages responsible
   for the origin of these numts in L3 after secondary contact occurred
   prior to, or coincident with, the northward expansion of L3. This study
   shows that, in the context of phylogeographic analysis, numts can
   provide evidence for past demographic events and can be useful tools for
   the reconstruction of complex evolutionary histories.}},

Abstract = {{The idiosyncratic behaviours of seed dispersers are important
   contributors to plant spatial associations and genetic structures. In
   this study, we used a combination of field, molecular and spatial
   studies to examine the connections between seed dispersal and the
   spatial and genetic structures of a dominant neotropical palm Attalea
   phalerata. Field observation and genetic parentage analysis both
   indicated that the majority of A. phalerata seeds were dispersed locally
   over short distances (<30 m from the maternal tree). Spatial and genetic
   structures between adults and seedlings were consistent with localized
   and short-distance seed dispersal. Dispersal contributed to spatial
   associations among maternal sibling seedlings and strong spatial and
   genetic structures in both seedlings dispersed near (<10 m) and away
   (>10 m) from maternal palms. Seedlings were also spatially aggregated
   with juveniles. These patterns are probably associated with the
   dispersal of seeds by rodents and the survival of recruits at specific
   microsites or neighbourhoods over successive fruiting periods. Our
   cross-cohort analyses found palms in older cohorts and cohort pairs were
   associated with a lower proportion of offspring and sibling neighbours
   and exhibited weaker spatial and genetic structures. Such patterns are
   consistent with increased distance- and density-dependent mortality over
   time among palms dispersed near maternal palms or siblings. The
   integrative approaches used for this study allowed us to infer the
   importance of seed dispersal activities in maintaining the aggregated
   distribution and significant genetic structures among A. phalerata
   palms. We further conclude that distance- and density-dependent
   mortality is a key postdispersal process regulating this palm
   population.}},

Abstract = {{In most social mammals, some females disperse from their natal group
   while others remain and breed there throughout their lives but, in a
   few, females typically disperse after adolescence and few individuals
   remain and breed in their natal group. These contrasts in philopatry and
   dispersal have an important consequence on the kinship structure of
   groups which, in turn, affects forms of social relationships between
   females. As yet, there is still widespread disagreement over the reasons
   for the evolution of habitual female dispersal, partly as a result of
   contrasting definitions of dispersal. This paper reviews variation in
   the frequency with which females leave their natal group or range
   (social dispersal) and argues that both the avoidance of local
   competition for resources and breeding opportunities and the need to
   find unrelated partners play an important role in contrasts between and
   within species.}},

Abstract = {{Where do new species arise? When do they form and how do they diverge
   from a common ancestor? A new comprehensive study of Arbacia sea urchins
   provides surprising answers to these questions. By combining mtDNA
   phylogeographic markers with a nuclear locus (encoding the sperm
   acrosomal protein bindin) known to be susceptible to high rates of
   adaptive codon evolution, Lessios (2012) show that new species and
   lineages arose relatively recently, most often in association with
   latitudinal shifts between the temperate zones and the tropics, and in
   one case, in association with a significant geological barrier to gene
   flow (the rise of the Isthmus of Panama). In addition to the where and
   when of Arbacia speciation, these new data resolve an important question
   about whoArbacia species are by revealing extensive allele sharing at
   both loci between a pair of broadly sympatric nominal species (that
   should perhaps be considered a single taxon). HowArbacia diverge from
   each other is less easily resolved: there is no evidence for
   reinforcement (via selection on bindin) as an important source of
   divergence between nominal species, and there are few other data to
   decide among the alternative hypotheses to explain Arbacia speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Teasing apart the effects of selection and demography on genetic
   polymorphism remains one of the major challenges in the analysis of
   population genomic data. The traditional approach has been to assume
   that demography would leave a genome-wide signature, whereas the effect
   of selection would be local. In the light of recent genomic surveys of
   sequence polymorphism, several authors have argued that this approach is
   questionable based on the evidence of the pervasive role of positive
   selection and that new approaches are needed. In the first part of this
   review, we give a few empirical and theoretical examples illustrating
   the difficulty in teasing apart the effects of selection and demography
   on genomic polymorphism patterns. In the second part, we review recent
   efforts to detect recent positive selection. Most available methods
   still rely on an a priori classification of sites in the genome but
   there are many promising new approaches. These new methods make use of
   the latest developments in statistics, explore aspects of the data that
   had been neglected hitherto or take advantage of the emerging population
   genomic data. A current and promising approach is based on first
   estimating demographic and genetic parameters, using, e.g., a likelihood
   or approximate Bayesian computation framework, focusing on extreme
   outlier regions, and then using an independent method to confirm these.
   Finally, especially for species where evidence of natural selection has
   been limited, more experimental and versatile approaches that contrast
   populations under varied environmental constraints might be more
   successful compared with species-wide genome scans in search of specific
   signatures.}},

Abstract = {{The Neolithic transition has been widely debated particularly regarding
   the extent to which this revolution implied a demographic expansion from
   the Near East. We attempted to shed some light on this process in
   northeastern Iberia by combining ancient DNA (aDNA) data from Early
   Neolithic settlers and published DNA data from Middle Neolithic and
   modern samples from the same region. We successfully extracted and
   amplified mitochondrial DNA from 13 human specimens, found at three
   archaeological sites dated back to the Cardial culture in the Early
   Neolithic (Can Sadurni and Chaves) and to the Late Early Neolithic (Sant
   Pau del Camp). We found that haplogroups with a low frequency in modern
   populationsN{*} and X1are found at higher frequencies in our Early
   Neolithic population (similar to 31\%). Genetic differentiation between
   Early and Middle Neolithic populations was significant (FST similar to
   0.13, P < 10-5), suggesting that genetic drift played an important role
   at this time. To improve our understanding of the Neolithic demographic
   processes, we used a Bayesian coalescence-based simulation approach to
   identify the most likely of three demographic scenarios that might
   explain the genetic data. The three scenarios were chosen to reflect
   archaeological knowledge and previous genetic studies using similar
   inferential approaches. We found that models that ignore population
   structure, as previously used in aDNA studies, are unlikely to explain
   the data. Our results are compatible with a pioneer colonization of
   northeastern Iberia at the Early Neolithic characterized by the arrival
   of small genetically distinctive groups, showing cultural and genetic
   connections with the Near East.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{As the frequency of antifungal drug resistance continues to increase,
   understanding the genetic structure of fungal populations, where
   resistant isolates have emerged and spread, is of major importance.
   Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitously distributed fungus and the
   primary causative agent of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a potentially
   lethal infection in immunocompromised individuals. In the last few
   years, an increasing number of A. fumigatus isolates has evolved
   resistance to triazoles, the primary drugs for treating IA infections.
   In most isolates, this multiple-triazole-resistance (MTR) phenotype is
   caused by mutations in the cyp51A gene similar to which encodes the
   protein targeted by the triazoles. We investigated the genetic
   differentiation and reproductive mode of A. fumigatus in the
   Netherlands, the country where the MTR phenotype probably originated, to
   determine their role in facilitating the emergence and distribution of
   resistance genotypes. Using 20 genome similar to wide neutral markers,
   we genotyped 255 Dutch isolates including 25 isolates with the MTR
   phenotype. In contrast to previous reports, our results show that Dutch
   A. fumigatus genotypes are genetically differentiated into five distinct
   populations. Four of the five populations show significant linkage
   disequilibrium, indicative of an asexual reproductive mode, whereas the
   fifth population is in linkage equilibrium, indicative of a sexual
   reproductive mode. Notably, the observed genetic differentiation among
   Dutch isolates does not correlate with geography, although all isolates
   with the MTR phenotype nest within a single, predominantly asexual,
   population. These results suggest that both reproductive mode and
   genetic differentiation contribute to the structure of Dutch A.
   fumigatus populations and are probably shaping the evolutionary dynamics
   of drug resistance in this potentially deadly pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the population structure of Grosmannia clavigera (Gc), a
   fungal symbiont of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) that plays a crucial
   role in the establishment and reproductive success of this pathogen.
   This insectfungal complex has destroyed over 16 million ha of lodgepole
   pine forests in Canada, the largest MPB epidemic in recorded history.
   During this current epidemic, MPB has expanded its range beyond
   historically recorded boundaries, both northward and eastward, and has
   now reached the jack pine of Alberta, potentially threatening the
   Canadian boreal forest. To better understand the dynamics between the
   beetle and its fungal symbiont, we sampled 19 populations in western
   North America and genotyped individuals from these populations with
   eight microsatellite markers. The fungus displayed high haplotype
   diversity, with over 250 unique haplotypes observed in 335 single spore
   isolates. Linkage equilibria in 13 of the 19 populations suggested that
   the fungus reproduces sexually. Bayesian clustering and distance
   analyses identified four genetic clusters that corresponded to four
   major geographical regions, which suggested that the epidemic arose from
   multiple geographical sources. A genetic cluster north of the Rocky
   Mountains, where the MPB has recently become established, experienced a
   population bottleneck, probably as a result of the recent range
   expansion. The two genetic clusters located north and west of the Rocky
   Mountains contained many fungal isolates admixed from all populations,
   possibly due to the massive movement of MPB during the epidemic. The
   general agreement in northsouth differentiation of MPB and G. clavigera
   populations points to the fungal pathogens dependence on the movement of
   its insect vector. In addition, the patterns of diversity and the
   individual assignment tests of the fungal associate suggest that
   migration across the Rocky Mountains occurred via a northeastern
   corridor, in accordance with meteorological patterns and observation of
   MPB movement data. Our results highlight the potential of this pathogen
   for both expansion and sexual reproduction, and also identify some
   possible barriers to gene flow. Understanding the ecological and
   evolutionary dynamics of this fungusbeetle association is important for
   the modelling and prediction of MPB epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{The ascomycete fungus Cryphonectria parasitica is an aggressive
   introduced pathogen of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.). It has
   spread throughout the chestnut-growing areas of Europe, with higher
   diversity in the regions close to its first introduction and lower
   diversity in its expanding ranges in Europe. To reconstruct the invasion
   events that could explain the high diversity of C. parasitica in Croatia
   and Slovenia, 180 samples were genotyped using 11 sequence-characterized
   amplified region markers. Eight of 11 loci were found to be polymorphic,
   and a total of 66 different haplotypes were identified. Bayesian
   clustering indicated the existence of two clusters, which suggests two
   separate introductions of C. parasitica in these regions. The first
   cluster is dominant in western parts of Croatia and Slovenia and the
   second in eastern and northern regions. The data analysis indicates that
   northern Italy was the first source of infection, with the subsequent
   introduction from south-eastern Europe, which contributed significantly
   to the diversity of the C. parasitica populations tested. Most
   haplotypes were probably derived through sexual recombination between a
   few divergent haplotypes, which suggests that multiple introductions and
   sexual reproduction are important for the formation of genetically
   diverse C. parasitica populations.}},

Title = {{Estimating selfing rates from reconstructed pedigrees using multilocus

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{100-116}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several methods have been developed to estimate the selfing rate of a
   population from a sample of individuals genotyped for several marker
   loci. These methods can be based on homozygosity excess (or inbreeding),
   identity disequilibrium, progeny array (PA) segregation or population
   assignment incorporating partial selfing. Progeny arraybased method is
   generally the best because it is not subject to some assumptions made by
   other methods (such as lack of misgenotyping, absence of biparental
   inbreeding and presence of inbreeding equilibrium), and it can reveal
   other facets of a mixed-mating system such as patterns of shared
   paternity. However, in practice, it is often difficult to obtain PAs,
   especially for animal species. In this study, we propose a method to
   reconstruct the pedigree of a sample of individuals taken from a
   monoecious diploid population practicing mixed mating, using multilocus
   genotypic data. Selfing and outcrossing events are then detected when an
   individual derives from identical parents and from two distinct parents,
   respectively. Selfing rate is estimated by the proportion of selfed
   offspring in the reconstructed pedigree of a sample of individuals. The
   method enjoys many advantages of the PA method, but without the need of
   a priori family structure, although such information, if available, can
   be utilized to improve the inference. Furthermore, the new method
   accommodates genotyping errors, estimates allele frequencies jointly and
   is robust to the presence of biparental inbreeding and inbreeding
   disequilibrium. Both simulated and empirical data were analysed by the
   new and previous methods to compare their statistical properties and
   accuracies.}},

Abstract = {{Allopatry and allopatric speciation can arise through two different
   mechanisms: vicariance or colonization through dispersal. Distinguishing
   between these different allopatric mechanisms is difficult and one of
   the major challenges in biogeographical research. Here, we address
   whether allopatric isolation in an endemic island lizard is the result
   of vicariance or dispersal. We estimated the amount and direction of
   gene flow during the divergence of isolated islet populations and
   subspecies of the endemic Skyros wall lizard Podarcis gaigeae, a
   phenotypically variable species that inhabits a major island and small
   islets in the Greek archipelago. We applied isolation-with-migration
   models to estimate population divergence times, population sizes and
   gene flow between isletmainland population pairs. Divergence times were
   significantly correlated with independently estimated geological
   divergence times. This correlation strongly supports a vicariance
   scenario where islet populations have sequentially become isolated from
   the major island. We did not find evidence for significant gene flow
   within P. g. gaigeae. However, gene-flow estimates from the islet to the
   mainland populations were positively affected by islet area and
   negatively by distance between the islet and mainland. We also found
   evidence for gene flow from one subspecies (P. g. weigandi) into another
   (P. g. gaigeae), but not in the other direction. Ongoing gene flow
   between the subspecies suggests that even in this geographically
   allopatric scenario with the sea posing a strong barrier to dispersal,
   divergence with some gene flow is still feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Among shallow water sea urchin genera, Arbacia is the only genus that
   contains species found in both high and low latitudes. In order to
   determine the geographical origin of the genus and its history of
   speciation events, we constructed phylogenies based on cytochrome
   oxidase I and sperm bindin from all its species. Both the mitochondrial
   and the nuclear gene genealogies show that Arbacia originated in the
   temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere and gave rise to three species
   in the eastern Pacific, which were then isolated from the Atlantic by
   the Isthmus of Panama. The mid-Atlantic barrier separated two additional
   species. The bindin data suggest that selection against hybridization is
   not important in the evolution of this molecule in this genus. Metz et
   al. in a previous publication found no evidence of selection on bindin
   of Arbacia and suggested that this might be due to allopatry between
   species, which obviated the need for species recognition. This
   suggestion formed the basis of the conclusion, widely spread in the
   literature, that the source of selection on sea urchin bindin (where it
   does occur) was reinforcement. However, the range of Arbacia spatuligera
   overlaps with that of two other species of Arbacia, and our data show
   that it is hybridizing with one of them. We found that even in the
   species that overlap geographically, there are no deviations from
   selective neutrality in the evolution of bindin.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary relationships of 120 root-nodulating bacteria isolated from
   the nodules of Pisum sativum cultivated at 22 different locations of the
   trans-Himalayan valleys of Lahaul and Spiti in the state of Himachal
   Pradesh of India were studied using 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, ERIC-PCR,
   sequencing of 16S rRNA, atpD, recA, nodC and nifH genes, carbon-source
   utilization pattern (BIOLOG (TM)), and whole-cell fatty acid profiling.
   The results demonstrated that all isolates belonged to Rhizobium
   leguminosarum symbiovar viciae (Rlv). Isolates from the two valleys were
   clearly separated on the basis of ERIC fingerprints, carbon-source
   utilization pattern, and whole-cell fatty acid methyl esters.
   Phylogenetic analysis of atpD, recA, nodC and nifH genes revealed a
   common Rlv sublineage in Spiti valley. Lahaul valley isolates were
   represented by three sequence types of atpD and recA genes, and four
   sequence types of nodC and nifH genes. Genotypes from the two valleys
   were completely distinct, except for two Lahaul isolates that shared
   nodC and nifH sequences with Spiti isolates but were otherwise more
   similar to other Lahaul isolates. Isolates from the two highest Spiti
   valley sites (above 4000 m) had a distinctive whole-cell fatty acid
   profile. Spiti valley isolates are closely related to Rlv sublineages
   from Xinjiang and Shanxi provinces in China, while Lahaul valley
   isolates resemble cosmopolitan strains of the western world. The high
   mountain pass between these valleys represents a boundary between two
   distinct microbial populations.}},

Abstract = {{In isolated oceanic islands, colonization patterns are often interpreted
   as resulting from dispersal rather than vicariant events. Such
   inferences may not be appropriate when island associations change over
   time and new islands do not form in a simple linear trend. Further
   complexity in the phylogeography of ocean islands arises when dealing
   with endangered taxa as extinctions, uncertainty on the number of
   evolutionary units, and human activities can obscure the progression of
   colonization events. Here, we address these issues through a
   reconstruction of the evolutionary history of giant Galapagos tortoises,
   integrating DNA data from extinct and extant species with information on
   recent human activities and newly available geological data. Our results
   show that only three of the five extinct or nearly extinct species
   should be considered independent evolutionary units. Dispersal from
   mainland South America started at approximately 3.2 Ma after the
   emergence of the two oldest islands of San Cristobal and Espanola.
   Dispersal from older to younger islands began approximately 1.74 Ma and
   was followed by multiple colonizations from different sources within the
   archipelago. Vicariant events, spurred by island formation, coalescence,
   and separation, contributed to lineage diversifications on Pinzon and
   Floreana dating from 1.26 and 0.85 Ma. This work provides an example of
   how to reconstruct the history of endangered taxa in spite of
   extinctions and human-mediated dispersal events and highlights the need
   to take into account both vicariance and dispersal when dealing with

Abstract = {{The disruption of reproductive timing by climatic harshness may result
   in the temporal isolation of conspecific populations and, ultimately, in
   speciation. However, whether temporal isolation alone can act as the
   force initiating speciation and how often the same type of climatic
   disruption results in the divergence of allochronic populations in a
   lineage are largely unknown. The reproductive period of the winter
   geometrid moth Inurois punctigera is separated into early and late
   winter in habitats with severe winters, but not in habitats with mild
   winters, suggesting that the reproductive season is disrupted by the
   harshness of the mid-winter period. Here, we show that sympatric pairs
   of early- and late-winter populations that differ in origin exist in
   different regions, suggesting a parallel divergence of reproductive
   timing. In each region, significant genetic differentiation exists
   between these early- and late-winter populations, suggesting that the
   temporal reproductive isolation has persisted. Moreover, we demonstrate
   that the temporal isolation, in comparison with geographic isolation,
   contributes greatly to the genetic differentiation among geographic and
   temporal populations by an analysis of molecular variance and by a
   comparison of genetic differentiations (FST) between geographic
   populations with and without difference in reproductive season. Our
   results suggest that adaptive divergence of allochronically reproducing
   populations has occurred independently in different regions, implying
   the generality of the role of temporal isolation in initiating
   speciation in a winter moth lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic conditions and landscape features often strongly affect species
   local distribution patterns, dispersal, reproduction and survival and
   may therefore have considerable impacts on species fine-scale spatial
   genetic structure (SGS). In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of
   combining fine-scale SGS analyses with isotropic and anisotropic spatial
   autocorrelation techniques to infer the impact of wind patterns on plant
   dispersal processes. We genotyped 1304 Azorella selago (Apiaceae)
   specimens, a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed plant, from four
   populations distributed across sub-Antarctic Marion Island. SGS was
   variable with Sp values ranging from 0.001 to 0.014, suggesting notable
   variability in dispersal distance and wind velocities between sites.
   Nonetheless, the data supported previous hypotheses of a strong NWSE
   gradient in wind strength across the island. Anisotropic autocorrelation
   analyses further suggested that dispersal is strongly directional, but
   varying between sites depending on the local prevailing winds. Despite
   the high frequency of gale-force winds on Marion Island, gene dispersal
   distance estimates (s) were surprisingly low (<10 m), most probably
   because of a low pollen dispersal efficiency. An SGS approach in
   association with isotropic and anisotropic analyses provides a powerful
   means to assess the relative influence of abiotic factors on dispersal
   and allow inferences that would not be possible without this combined
   approach.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A wide range of plant lines has been propagated by farmers during crop
   selection and dissemination, but consequences of this crop
   diversification on plant-microbe interactions have been neglected. Our
   hypothesis was that crop evolutionary history shaped the way the
   resulting lines interact with soil bacteria in their rhizospheres. Here,
   the significance of maize diversification as a factor influencing
   selection of soil bacteria by seedling roots was assessed by comparing
   rhizobacterial community composition of inbred lines representing the
   five main genetic groups of maize, cultivated in a same European soil.
   Rhizobacterial community composition of 21-day-old seedlings was
   analysed using a 16S rRNA taxonomic microarray targeting 19 bacterial
   phyla. Rhizobacterial community composition of inbred lines depended on
   the maize genetic group. Differences were largely due to the prevalence
   of certain Betaproteobacteria and especially Burkholderia, as confirmed
   by quantitative PCR and cloning/sequencing. However, these differences
   in bacterial root colonization did not correlate with plant
   microsatellite genetic distances between maize genetic groups or
   individual lines. Therefore, the genetic structure of maize that arose
   during crop diversification (resulting in five main groups), but not the
   extent of maize diversification itself (as determined by maize genetic
   distances), was a significant factor shaping rhizobacterial community
   composition of seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Life-cycle characteristics and habitat processes can potentially
   interact to determine gene flow and genetic structuring of parasitic
   species. In this comparative study, we analysed the genetic structure of
   two freshwater trematode species with different life histories using
   cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) sequences and examined the effect of a
   unidirectional river current on their genetic diversity at 10 sites
   along the river. We found moderate genetic structure consistent with an
   isolation-by-distance pattern among subpopulations of Coitocaecum parvum
   but not in Stegodexamene anguillae. These contrasting parasite
   population structures were consistent with the relative dispersal
   abilities of their most mobile hosts (i.e. their definitive hosts).
   Genetic diversity decreased, as a likely consequence of unidirectional
   river flow, with increasing distance upstream in C. parvum, which
   utilizes a definitive host with only restricted mobility. The absence of
   such a pattern in S. anguillae suggests that unidirectional river flow
   affects parasite species differently depending on the dispersal
   abilities of their most mobile host. In conclusion, genetic structure,
   genetic diversity loss and drift are stronger in parasites whose most
   mobile hosts have low dispersal abilities and small home ranges. An
   additional prediction can be made for parasites under unidirectional
   drift: those parasites that stay longer in their benthic intermediate
   host or have more than one benthic intermediate hosts would have
   relatively high local recruitment and hence increased retention of
   upstream genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation occurs when a population evolves a phenotype that
   confers a selective advantage in its local environment, but which may
   not be advantageous in other habitats. Restricted gene flow and strong
   selection pressures are prerequisites for local adaptation. Fishes in
   the family Salmonidae are predicted to provide numerous examples of
   local adaptation because of the high fidelity of returning to spawn in
   their natal streams, which results in highly structured populations, and
   the wide diversity of environments that salmonids have colonized. These
   conditions are ideally suited for producing a set of specialist
   phenotypes, whose fitness is maximized for one specific habitat, rather
   than a generalist phenotype similarly viable in several environments.
   Understanding patterns and processes leading to local adaptations has
   long been a goal of evolutionary biology, but it is only recently that
   identifying the molecular basis for local adaptation has become feasible
   because of advances in genomic technologies. The study of shared
   adaptive phenotypes in populations that are both geographically distant
   and genetically distinct should reveal some of the fundamental molecular
   mechanisms associated with local adaptation. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology, Miller (2012) make a significant contribution to the
   development of adaptation genomics. This study suggests that salmonids
   use standing genetic variation to select beneficial alleles for local
   adaptations rather than de novo mutations in the same gene or
   alternative physiological pathways. Identifying the genetic basis for
   local adaptation has major implications for the management, conservation
   and potential restoration of salmonid populations.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial scale at which samples are collected and analysed influences
   the inferences that can be drawn from landscape genetic studies. We
   examined genetic structure and its landscape correlates in the pitcher
   plant midge, Metriocnemus knabi, an inhabitant of the purple pitcher
   plant, Sarracenia purpurea, across several spatial scales that are
   naturally delimited by the midges habitat (leaf, plant, cluster of
   plants, bog and system of bogs). We analysed 11 microsatellite loci in
   710 M.similar to knabi larvae from two systems of bogs in Algonquin
   Provincial Park (Canada) and tested the hypotheses that variables
   related to habitat structure are associated with genetic differentiation
   in this midge. Up to 54\% of variation in individual-based genetic
   distances at several scales was explained by broadscale landscape
   variables of bog size, pitcher plant density within bogs and
   connectivity of pitcher plant clusters. Our results indicate that
   oviposition behaviour of females at fine scales, as inferred from the
   spatial locations of full-sib larvae, and spatially limited gene flow at
   broad scales represent the important processes underlying observed
   genetic patterns in M.similar to knabi. Broadscale landscape features
   (bog size and plant density) appear to influence oviposition behaviour
   of midges, which in turn influences the patterns of genetic
   differentiation observed at both fine and broad scales. Thus, we
   inferred linkages among genetic patterns, landscape patterns and
   ecological processes across spatial scales in M.similar to knabi. Our
   results reinforce the value of exploring such links simultaneously
   across multiple spatial scales and landscapes when investigating genetic
   diversity within a species.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonid fishes exhibit extensive local adaptations owing to abundant
   environmental variation and precise natal homing. This extensive local
   adaptation makes conservation and restoration of salmonids a challenge.
   For example, defining unambiguous units of conservation is difficult,
   and restoration attempts often fail owing to inadequate adaptive
   matching of translocated populations. A better understanding of the
   genetic architecture of local adaptation in salmonids could provide
   valuable information to assist in conserving and restoring natural
   populations of these important species. Here, we use a combination of
   laboratory crosses and next-generation sequencing to investigate the
   genetic architecture of the parallel adaptation of rapid development
   rate in two geographically and genetically distant populations of
   rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Strikingly, we find that not only
   is a parallel genetic mechanism used but that a conserved haplotype is
   responsible for this intriguing adaptation. The repeated use of adaptive
   genetic variation across distant geographical areas could be a general
   theme in salmonids and have important implications for conservation and
   restoration.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pristionchus pacificus, recently established as a model organism in
   evolutionary biology, is a cosmopolitan nematode that has a necromenic
   association with scarab beetles. The diverse array of host beetle
   species and habitat types occupied by P. pacificus make it a good model
   for investigating local adaptation to novel environments. Presence of P.
   pacificus on La Reunion Island, a young volcanic island with a dynamic
   geological history and a wide variety of ecozones, facilitates such
   investigation in an island biogeographic setting. Microsatellite data
   from 20 markers and 223 strains and mitochondrial sequence data from 272
   strains reveal rich genetic diversity among La Reunion P. pacificus
   isolates, shaped by differentially timed introductions from diverse
   sources and in association with different beetle species. Distinctions
   between volcanic zones and between arid western and wet eastern climatic
   zones have likely limited westward dispersal of recently colonized
   lineages and maintained a genetic distinction between eastern and
   western clades. The highly selfing lifestyle of P. pacificus contributes
   to the strong fine-scale population structure detected, with each beetle
   host harbouring strongly differentiated assemblages of strains. Periodic
   out-crossing generates admixture between genetically diverse lineages,
   creating a diverse array of allelic combinations likely to increase the
   evolutionary potential of the species and facilitate adaptation to local
   environments and beetle hosts.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{267-280}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Poleward range expansions are widespread responses to recent climate
   change and are crucial for the future persistence of many species.
   However, evolutionary change in traits such as colonization history and
   habitat preference may also be necessary to track environmental change
   across a fragmented landscape. Understanding the likelihood and speed of
   such adaptive change is important in determining the rate of species
   extinction with ongoing climate change. We conducted an amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based genome scan across the
   recently expanded UK range of the Brown Argus butterfly, Aricia agestis,
   and used outlier-based (DFDIST and BayeScan) and association-based
   (Isolation-By-Adaptation) statistical approaches to identify signatures
   of evolutionary change associated with range expansion and habitat use.
   We present evidence for (i) limited effects of range expansion on
   population genetic structure and (ii) strong signatures of selection at
   approximately 5\% AFLP loci associated with both the poleward range
   expansion of A. agestis and differences in habitat use across
   long-established and recently colonized sites. Patterns of allele
   frequency variation at these candidate loci suggest that adaptation to
   new habitats at the range margin has involved selection on genetic
   variation in habitat use found across the long-established part of the
   range. Our results suggest that evolutionary change is likely to affect
   species responses to climate change and that genetic variation in
   ecological traits across species distributions should be maximized to
   facilitate range shifts across a fragmented landscape, particularly in
   species that show strong associations with particular habitats.}},

Title = {{Extensive gene flow over Europe and possible speciation over Eurasia in

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biogeographical patterns and large-scale genetic structure have been
   little studied in ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, despite the ecological and
   economic importance of EM symbioses. We coupled population genetics and
   phylogenetic approaches to understand spatial structure in fungal
   populations on a continental scale. Using nine microsatellite markers,
   we characterized gene flow among 16 populations of the widespread EM
   basidiomycete Laccaria amethystina over Europe (i.e. over 2900 km). We
   also widened our scope to two additional populations from Japan (104 km
   away) and compared them with European populations through microsatellite
   markers and multilocus phylogenies, using three nuclear genes (NAR, G6PD
   and ribosomal DNA) and two mitochondrial ribosomal genes. European L.
   amethystina populations displayed limited differentiation (average FST =
   0.041) and very weak isolation by distance (IBD). This panmictic
   European pattern may result from effective aerial dispersal of spores,
   high genetic diversity in populations and mutualistic interactions with
   multiple hosts that all facilitate migration. The multilocus phylogeny
   based on nuclear genes confirmed that Japanese and European specimens
   were closely related but clustered on a geographical basis. By using
   microsatellite markers, we found that Japanese populations were strongly
   differentiated from the European populations (FST = 0.416), more than
   expected by extrapolating the European pattern of IBD. Population
   structure analyses clearly separated the populations into two clusters,
   i.e. European and Japanese clusters. We discuss the possibility of IBD
   in a continuous population (considering some evidence for a ring species
   over the Northern Hemisphere) vs. an allopatric speciation over Eurasia,
   making L. amethystina a promising model of intercontinental species for
   future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Afforestation is a common and widespread management practice throughout
   the world, yet its implications for the genetic diversity of native
   populations are still poorly understood. We examined the effect of
   Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) plantations on the genetic composition of
   nearby conspecific native populations. We focused on two native
   populations in Israel with different levels of isolation from the
   surrounding plantations and compared the genetic diversity of naturally
   established young trees within the native populations with that of local
   native adults, using nine nuclear microsatellite markers. We found that
   the genetic composition of the recruits was significantly different from
   that of local adults in both populations, with allelic frequency changes
   between generations that could not be ascribed to random drift, but
   rather to substantial gene flow from the surrounding planted Aleppo pine
   populations. The more isolated population experienced a lower gene-flow
   level (22\%) than the less isolated population (49\%). The genetic
   divergence between native populations at the adult-tree stage (Fst =
   0.32) was more than twice as high as that of the young trees naturally
   established around native adults (Fst = 0.15). Our findings provide
   evidence for a rapid genetic homogenization process of native
   populations following the massive planting efforts in the last decades.
   These findings have important implications for forest management and
   nature conservation and constitute a warning sign for the risk of
   translocation of biota for local biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation can significantly affect mating and pollen
   dispersal patterns in plant populations, although the differential
   effects of the various aspects of fragmentation are poorly understood.
   In this study, we used eight microsatellite loci to investigate the
   effect of fragmentation on the mating system and pollen dispersal within
   one large and eight small population remnants of Banksia sphaerocarpa
   var. caesia, a bird-pollinated shrub in the southern agricultural region
   of Western Australia. The large population had a much larger
   neighbourhood size and lower selfing rate, maternal pollen pool
   differentiation and within-plot mean pollen dispersal distance than the
   small populations. Outcrossing was consistently high and ranged from
   85.7\% +/- 2.6 to 98.5\% +/- 0.9, and mating patterns suggested
   nearest-neighbour pollination. Pollen immigration into small populations
   ranged from 2.8\% +/- 1.8 to 16.5\% +/- 3.2. Using the small
   populations, we tested for correlations between various fragmentation
   variables and mating system and pollen dispersal parameters. We found
   significant negative linear relationships between population isolation
   and outcrossing rate; population shape and neighbourhood size; and
   conspecific density and mean pollen dispersal distance. There were
   significant positive linear relationships between population shape and
   pollen pool differentiation and between population size and number of
   different fathers per seed crop. Our results suggest that birds may use
   a series of fragmented populations as a vegetation corridor while
   foraging across the landscape and that population connectivity is a
   critical determinant of pollinator visitation. Our results also suggest
   that the effect of a linear population shape on the mating system and
   pollen dispersal is routinely underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Avian wing length is an important trait that covaries with the ecology
   and migratory behaviour of a species and tends to change rapidly when
   the conditions are altered. Long-distance migrants typically have longer
   wings than short-distance migrants and sedentary species, and
   long-winged species also tend to be more dispersive. Although the
   substantial heritability of avian wing length is well established, the
   identification of causal genes has remained elusive. Based on
   large-scale genotyping of 1404 informative single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNP) in a captive population of 1067 zebra finches, we
   here show that the within-population variation of relative wing length
   (h(2) = 0.74 +/- 0.05) is associated with standing genetic variation in
   at least six genomic regions (one genome-wide significant and five
   suggestive). The variance explained by these six quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) sums to 36.8\% of the phenotypic variance (half of the additive
   genetic variance), although this likely is an overestimate attributable
   to the Beavis effect. As avian wing length is primarily determined by
   the length of the primary feathers, we then searched for candidate genes
   that are related to feather growth. Interestingly, all of the QTL
   signals co-locate with Wnt growth factors and closely interacting genes
   (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt6, Wnt7a, Wnt9a, RhoU and RhoV). Our findings
   therefore suggest that standing genetic variation in the Wnt genes might
   be linked to avian wing morphology, although there are many other genes
   that also fall within the confidence regions.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{340-349}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cardenolides are a class of plant secondary compounds that inhibit the
   proper functioning of the Na+, K+-ATPase enzyme in susceptible animals.
   Nonetheless, many insect species are able to sequester cardenolides for
   their own defence. These include butterflies in the subfamily Danainae
   (Family: Nymphalidae) such as the monarch (Danaus plexippus). Previous
   studies demonstrated that monarchs harbour an asparagine (N) to
   histidine (H) substitution (N122H) in the a subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase
   (ATPa) that reduces this enzymes sensitivity to cardenolides. More
   recently, it has been suggested that at ATPa position 111, monarchs may
   also harbour a leucine (L)/glutamine (Q) polymorphism. This later amino
   acid could also contribute to cardenolide insensitivity. However, here
   we find that incorrect annotation of the initially reported DNA sequence
   for ATPa has led to several erroneous conclusions. Using a population
   genetic and phylogenetic analysis of monarchs and their close relatives,
   we show that an ancient Q111L substitution occurred prior to the
   radiation of all Danainae, followed by a second substitution at the same
   site to valine (V), which arose before the diversification of the Danaus
   genus. In contrast, N122H appears to be a recent substitution specific
   to monarchs. Surprisingly, examination of a broader insect phylogeny
   reveals that the same progression of amino acid substitutions (Q111L ?
   L111V + N122H) has also occurred in Chyrsochus beetles (Family:
   Chrysomelidae, Subfamily: Eumolpinae) that feed on
   cardenolide-containing host plants. The parallel pattern of amino acid
   substitution in these two distantly related lineages is consistent with
   an adaptive role for these substitutions in reducing cardenolide
   sensitivity and suggests that their temporal order may be limited by
   epistatic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Hypoxia is a key factor determining survival, and haemoglobins are
   targets of selection in species native to high-altitude regions. We
   studied population genetic structure and evaluated evidence for local
   adaptation in the crested duck (Lophonetta specularioides).
   Differentiation, gene flow and time since divergence between highland
   and lowland populations were assessed for three haemoglobin genes
   (alpha(A), alpha(D), beta(A)) and compared to seven reference loci (six
   autosomal introns and mtDNA). Four derived amino acid replacements were
   found in the globin genes that had elevated Phi ST values between the
   Andean highlands and Patagonian lowlands. A single beta(A)-globin
   polymorphism at a site known to influence O-2 affinity was fixed for
   different alleles in the two populations, whereas three alpha(A)- and
   alpha(D)-globin polymorphisms exhibited high heterozygosity in the
   highlands but not in the lowlands. Coalescent analyses supported
   restricted gene flow for haemoglobin alleles and mitochondrial DNA but
   nonzero gene flow for the introns. Simulating genetic data under a
   drift-migration model of selective neutrality, the beta(A)-globin fell
   outside the 95\% confidence limit of simulated data, suggesting that
   directional selection is maintaining different variants in the
   contrasting elevational environments, thereby restricting migration of
   beta(A)-globin alleles. The alpha(A)- and alpha(D)-globins, by contrast,
   did not differ from the simulated values, suggesting that variants in
   these genes are either selectively neutral, or that the effects of
   selection could not be differentiated from background levels of
   population structure and linkage disequilibrium. This study illustrates
   the combined effects of selection and population history on inferring
   levels of population divergence for a species distributed across an
   altitudinal gradient in which selection for hypoxia resistance has
   likely played an important role.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization is an important evolutionary factor in the diversification
   of many plant and animal species. Of particular interest is that
   historical hybridization resulting in the origin of new species or
   introgressants has occurred between species now geographically separated
   by great distances. Here, we report that Senecio massaicus, a tetraploid
   species native to Morocco and the Canary Islands, contains genetic
   material of two distinct, geographically separated lineages: a
   Mediterranean lineage and a mainly southern African lineage. A
   time-calibrated internal transcribed spacer phylogeny indicates that the
   hybridization event took place up to 6.18 Ma. Because the southern
   African lineage has never been recorded from Morocco or the Canary
   Islands, we hypothesize that it reached this area in the distant past,
   but never became permanently established. Interestingly, the southern
   African lineage includes S.similar to inaequidens, a highly invasive
   species that has recently become widespread throughout Europe and was
   introduced at the end of the 19th century as a wool alien. Our results
   suggest that this more recent invasion of Europe by S.similar to
   inaequidens represents the second arrival of this lineage into the

Abstract = {{The Red Sea is a unique marine ecosystem with contrasting gradients of
   temperature and salinity along its north-to-south axis. It is an
   extremely oligotrophic environment that is characterized by perpetual
   year-round water column stratification, high annual solar irradiation,
   and negligible riverine and precipitation inputs. In this study, we
   investigated whether the contemporary environmental conditions shape
   community assemblages by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes of bacteria in
   surface water samples collected from the northeastern half of this water
   body. A combined total of 1855 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
   recovered from the small-cell and large-cell fractions. Here, a few
   major OTUs affiliated with Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria accounted
   for similar to 93\% of all sequences, whereas a tail of rare OTUs
   represented most of the diversity. OTUs allied to Surface 1a/b SAR11
   clades and Prochlorococcus related to the high-light-adapted (HL2)
   ecotype were the most widespread and predominant sequence types.
   Interestingly, the frequency of taxa that are typically found in the
   upper mesopelagic zone was significantly elevated in the northern
   transects compared with those in the central, presumably as a direct
   effect of deep convective mixing in the Gulf of Aqaba and water exchange
   with the northern Red Sea. Although temperature was the best predictor
   of species richness across all major lineages, both spatial and
   environmental distances correlated strongly with phylogenetic distances.
   Our results suggest that the bacterial diversity of the Red Sea is as
   high as in other tropical seas and provide evidence for fundamental
   differences in the biogeography of pelagic communities between the
   northern and central regions.}},

Title = {{Heterozygosity predicts clutch and egg size but not plasticity in a

Abstract = {{We investigated the link between heterozygosity and the reaction norm
   attributes of reproductive performance in female house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus). We collected data on clutch size, egg size, hatching
   success and nestling survival in 2816 nesting attempts made by 791
   marked individuals over a 16-year period. Pedigree analysis revealed no
   evidence of inbreeding. Neither parentoffspring regression nor an animal
   model revealed significant heritability in clutch or egg size. We
   selected 42 females that laid at least seven clutches at our study site
   and used a survey of 21 autosomal microsatellite loci to estimate
   heterozygosity for each female. We controlled for phenotypic plasticity
   and found that both clutch and egg size showed significant positive
   correlations with heterozygosity. We found no evidence that
   heterozygosity influenced the slope of individual reaction norms.
   Further analysis suggested that clutch size was affected by
   heterozygosity across the genome, but egg size had more complex
   relationships, with evidence favouring the influence of multiple loci.
   Given the apparent lack of inbreeding and large population size, our
   results suggest associative overdominance as the likely mechanism for
   the impact of heterozygosity, but also created a puzzle about the
   process producing associations between neutral markers and the genes
   affecting clutch size or egg size. One possible explanation is a
   long-term residual effect of the historical bottleneck that occurred
   when house sparrows were introduced into North America. The existence of
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations in a population with considerable
   phenotypic plasticity and little inbreeding implies that the effects of
   heterozygosity may be more significant than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of multiple reproductives within an ant colony changes
   the balance between indirect fitness benefits and reproductive
   competition. We test whether the number of matings by an ant queen
   (polyandry) correlates negatively with the number of reproductive queens
   in the colony (polygyny), whether the patrilines and matrilines differ
   in their contribution to the sexual and worker progeny and whether there
   is an overall reproductive skew. For these aims, we genotyped both
   worker and sexual offspring from colonies of the ant Formica sanguinea
   in three populations. Most colonies were monogynous, but eight (11\%)
   were polygynous with closely related queens. Most queens in the
   monogynous colonies (86\%) had mated with multiple males. The effective
   paternity was lower than the actual number of mates, and the paternity
   skew was significant. Furthermore, in some monogynous colonies, the
   patrilines were differently represented in the worker pupae and sexual
   pupae produced at the same time. Likewise, the matrilines in polygynous
   colonies were differently present in worker pupae and male offspring.
   The effective number of matings by a queen was significantly lower in
   polygynous colonies (mean me = 1.68) than in monogynous colonies (means
   2.062.61). The results give support to the hypotheses that polyandry and
   polygyny are alternative breeding strategies and that reproductive
   competition can lead to different representation of patrilines and
   matrilines among the sexual and worker broods.}},

Title = {{Host and habitat specialization of avian malaria in Africa}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{431-441}},

Abstract = {{Studies of both vertebrates and invertebrates have suggested that
   specialists, as compared to generalists, are likely to suffer more
   serious declines in response to environmental change. Less is known
   about the effects of environmental conditions on specialist versus
   generalist parasites. Here, we study the evolutionary strategies of
   malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) among different bird host
   communities. We determined the parasite diversity and prevalence of
   avian malaria in three bird communities in the lowland forests in
   Cameroon, highland forests in East Africa and fynbos in South Africa. We
   calculated the host specificity index of parasites to examine the range
   of hosts parasitized as a function of the habitat and investigated the
   phylogenetic relationships of parasites. First, using phylogenetic and
   ancestral reconstruction analyses, we found an evolutionary tendency for
   generalist malaria parasites to become specialists. The transition rate
   at which generalists become specialists was nearly four times as great
   as the rate at which specialists become generalists. We also found more
   specialist parasites and greater parasite diversity in African lowland
   rainforests as compared to the more climatically variable habitats of
   the fynbos and the highland forests. Thus, with environmental changes,
   we anticipate a change in the distribution of both specialist and
   generalist parasites with potential impacts on bird communities.}},
